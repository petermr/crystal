<p>In order to explain this phenomenon, we employ the Frenkel–Kontorova–Tomlinson (FKT) model to analyze the role of structural commensurability in friction behaviors. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f011">Figure 11</xref>, when two layers are commensurate, atoms of the top layer are spatially matched with the atoms of the bottom layer. The contribution of each atomic pair to the total force is maximized, thus leading to a high friction force. On the other hand, when the two layers are incommensurate, the friction force of an atomic pair may be cancelled out among the other pairs, thus leading to a low friction force [

 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] have explained the strong orientation dependence of the friction, and low friction or even superlubricity can be obtained by changing the rotation angle between the tip and substrate. The most convincing demonstration to date came from the measurements by Dienwiebel et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], in which a small graphite flake with different orientations was moved on a graphite surface using an AFM. The results showed that at two orientations (0° and 60°) corresponding to the friction peaks, the flake and substrate lattices were perfectly aligned, which revealed a dependence of friction on the orientation.
