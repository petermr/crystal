<p>Na
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> can be obtained by the reaction of 2NaH and LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> in an organic solvent [
 <xref rid="B270-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>], in the solid-state at very high hydrogen pressure [
 <xref rid="B270-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>], by means of a mechanically activated reaction between NaH, LiH, and NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> (Equation (86)) [
 <xref rid="B271-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>], or 2NaH + LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B272-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>,
 <xref rid="B273-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>,
 <xref rid="B274-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>], or NaH + LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B275-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>], or 2NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> + LiH [
 <xref rid="B276-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>], or by the reactive mechanical milling of 2NaH+LiH+Al that was catalyzed with TiF
 <sub>3</sub> under 30 bar of hydrogen pressure [
 <xref rid="B277-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Wang et al. produced Na
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> by the reaction between 2NaH and LiAH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B274-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>]. However, detailed study of the synthesis reaction pathway by X-ray diffraction demonstrated that, during mechanical milling, a metathesis reaction occurred to produce a mixture of LiH, NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, and residual NaH, i.e., the same reactants of Equation (86).
