<p id="Par9">The structures of coesite-IV and of coesite-V were solved and refined using the datasets collected at ~36, 40, 44, and 49 GPa for the former (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and at ∼57 GPa for the latter (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>) (see also Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). For silica, known for its rich polymorphism
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, the structures of coesite-IV and coesite-V are unusually complex (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but very alike. Their lattice parameters are very similar, and the unit cells contain 16 SiO
 <sub>2</sub> formula units. The structure of coesite-IV possesses 
 <italic>tetra-</italic>, 
 <italic>penta-</italic>, and 
 <italic>hexa-</italic>coordinated silicon; the structure of coesite-V maintains only 
 <italic>penta-</italic> and 
 <italic>hexa-</italic>coordinated silicon (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In fact, analyzing them in detail, one can see that the structures of coesite-IV and coesite-V may be considered as a three-dimensional framework of face- and edge-sharing octahedra with the empty space, filled by SiO
 <sub>5</sub> and SiO
 <sub>4</sub> (in coesite-IV), or only SiO
 <sub>5</sub> (in coesite-V) polyhedra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The findings described above present three crystalchemical surprises at once: 
 <italic>penta-</italic>coordinated silicon, face-sharing SiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra, and the number of essentially different constituents in the structure of silica. These results are discussed below.
