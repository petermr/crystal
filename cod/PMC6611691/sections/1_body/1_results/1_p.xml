<p>LMO has a monoclinic crystal structure (
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/

 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>16</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>28</italic>
 </xref>), with a primitive unit cell comprising two stacks of four corner-sharing MoO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra and two MoO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra arranged along a chain (see 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Although it is 3D in structure, electronically (for a doublet of bands crossing the Fermi energy), it is 1D due to the very weak orbital overlap between different stacks within the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>29</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>31</italic>
 </xref>). As highlighted in purple in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, only two of the four MoO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra are believed to have partially occupied 
 <italic>d</italic>-shells that can contribute to the electrical conduction, which proceeds along the zigzag chain that extends in the crystallographic 
 <italic>b</italic>-direction (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Correspondingly, along Г-X (see 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and Г-Z (not shown), the interchain dispersion is almost negligible. A cut along the P-K line is shown in the lower panel of 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>. Because of the strong crystal field effects, the two bands crossing the Fermi level (one for each stack) are of 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xy</sub>
 </italic> character, while the 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xz</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>d
  <sub>yz</sub>
 </italic> orbitals within the same manifold are either empty or fully occupied, with a minimum gap of around 0.4 eV (highlighted in green in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) located midway along the P-K line. (This particular aspect of the band structure will become important later.) Last, 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> shows a typical in-chain resistivity curve ρ
 <italic>
  <sub>b</sub>
 </italic>(
 <italic>T</italic>). The upturn in ρ
 <italic>
  <sub>b</sub>
 </italic>(
 <italic>T</italic>) occurs around 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> ~ 25 ± 5 K, irrespective of whether the ground state is superconducting. Above 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>, the metallic behavior is usually ascribed to TLL physics, whereas the nonmetallic state below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> has remained a mystery.
