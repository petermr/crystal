 </inline-formula> mode of the residual ice after transition to the symmetric phase ice X, their characteristics are specific to methane hydrate at high pressure. Our theoretical analysis, within the harmonic approximation, describes these modes as being shared among the water and methane degrees of freedom in the MH-IV structure. We denote them as IV modes, as they are characteristic of the latter structure. They are due to the strong repulsive interaction between the guest methane and the host water network in MH-IV; an analogous enhancement of mode mixing with pressure was also detected in MH-III (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, the mode dispersion upon compression extracted from our MD simulations is in agreement with Raman results. Thus, the appearance of these modes can also be considered as a signature of the MH-IV phase.
