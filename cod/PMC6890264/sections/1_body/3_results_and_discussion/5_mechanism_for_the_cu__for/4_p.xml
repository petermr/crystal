<p>In the case of Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> CE, the constraints imposed on the activated complex are more severe because GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> is a much stronger Lewis acid than InCl
 <sub>3</sub>, therefore being capable of extracting lattice S
 <sup>2–</sup> from the template Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S NCs (Ga–S = 393 kJ/mol, In–S = 313–316 kJ/mol),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>
 </sup> leading to etching rather than CE (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>a), as demonstrated above (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Complexation of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> with TOP suppresses the NC etching but does not lead to CE. This demonstrates that the activated complex formed upon adsorption of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP on the NC surface effectively weakens the interaction between Ga and the lattice S
 <sup>2–</sup> and also prevents interaction between the P donor head and the Cu
 <sup>+</sup> ions (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>b). In contrast, both GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP result in successful Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> CE. All three ligands (TOP, TPP, DPP) are bound to GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> through the lone pair on the phosphorus atom and an empty sp
 <sup>3</sup> orbital of gallium.

 </sup> To extract Cu
 <sup>+</sup>, the phosphine acts as Lewis base and binds to Cu
 <sup>+</sup> through the same lone pair. In order for the phosphine to bind to Cu
 <sup>+</sup>, while still preventing etching by attack of the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> to lattice S
 <sup>2–</sup> ions, the activated complex at the NC surface (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>c) must be such that the Cu–P bond formation and the Ga–P bond breaking occur simultaneously (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>c, steps 1–3) and are followed by the immediate place exchange between Cu
 <sup>+</sup> and Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>. We attribute the higher CE reactivities of the GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP to a more favorable geometry of the activated complex formed upon their adsorption on the surface of the template Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S NCs, as well as a weaker Ga–P bond compared to GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP. In GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, the Ga–P bond is weaker than that in GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP (see 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>), fulfilling the conditions for a fast place exchange between Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> and Cu
 <sup>+</sup>, while still making the competing reaction between GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> and the lattice S
 <sup>2–</sup> ions less likely (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>c, steps 1–3). We note that the Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> place exchange is thermodynamically favored as it results in the formation of two new bonds that are stronger than the initial ones (viz., the Cu–P bond in the Cu–phosphine Lewis acid–base adduct, which is favored because Cu
 <sup>+</sup> is a much softer Lewis acid than Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>, η = 6.28 and 17 eV, respectively,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 </sup> and the Ga–S bond, which has a bond strength of 393 kJ/mol while the enthalpy of formation of Cu
 <sub>2</sub>S is only −79.5 kJ/mol
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>
 </sup>). Nevertheless, some degree of etching still occurs as the NCs reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP are smaller than the template NCs (viz., 10.8 ± 1.0, 11.1 ± 1.1, and 12.3 ± 1.0 nm, respectively, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.9b05337/suppl_file/nn9b05337_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>, Figure S1). The observed shrinkage (12.2 and 9.76%, respectively) is too large to be attributed to a decrease in unit cell volume alone (see discussion on crystal lattice contraction above). The difference in reactivity between InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP as CE reactants may be due to the fact that In
 <sup>3+</sup> exhibits three-, four-, five-, and six-coordination, whereas Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> is limited to three- and four-coordination.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>
 </sup> InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP has thus more degrees of freedom to rearrange itself at the nanocrystal surface to form the Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S–InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP activated complex, whereas GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP does not, making the formation of the Cu

 </sub>S–GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP activated complex subjected to more stringent orientational constraints and therefore less likely.
