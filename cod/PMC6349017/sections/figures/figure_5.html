 <caption> Top views of snapshots illustrating solvent-assisted proton transfer mechanisms at (a) ZnO(101[combining macron]0), and (b) ZnO(112[combining macron]0). The participating solvent water molecule is colored in cyan, the net proton donors and acceptors in orange, and the substrate O and Zn atoms in red and gray, respectively. For ZnO(101[combining macron]0), the subsurface layer is shown grayed-out. Surrounding water molecules are shown as thin lines. </caption>
