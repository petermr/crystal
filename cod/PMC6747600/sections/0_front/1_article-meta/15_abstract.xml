Some of them were studied as promising thermoelectric materials. Recently, B20 monosilicides have attracted attention as a new class of topological semimetals with topological charge greater than unity. In the present work, we analyze the electronic structures of B20-type monosilicides of the fourth, fifth, and sixth periods of the Periodic Table in order to reveal their common features and peculiarities. To make this analysis more consistent, we performed a density-functional study of the electronic structures of the monosilicides in a unified manner. We reviewed the results of previous calculations and the available experimental data, comparing them with our results. The band structures of ReSi and TcSi not found in the literature were calculated and analyzed as well. The topological properties of these materials and of some isostructural germanides and stannides were investigated. Analysis reveals the current understanding of electronic structures and properties of this compound group.
