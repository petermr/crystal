<p>On the other hand, the scattering layer with embedded YSZ nanoparticles was successfully fabricated using the conventional slit coating method. ZrO
 <sub>2,</sub> comprising YSZ has a monoclinic crystal structure at room temperature. It changes to a tetragonal crystal structure and a cubic crystal structure as temperature increases. YSZ comprised of Yttria doped ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> has a stable crystal structure even when temperature increases. YSZ has characteristics of chemical stability, thermal resistance, low thermal conductivity, and high strength. It has similar optical properties to ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>, including a high refractive index. The YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer was coated with various thicknesses of 1.5 μm, 2.5 μm, 4.0 μm, and 7.0 μm, respectively, and then was cured at 500 °C. Next, 1 μm of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> was coated as the planarization layer. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-f003">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the morphology of the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer and the planarization layer including a cross sectional view, measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface of the planarization layer was flat with small defects, like the glass substrate. Moreover, the density of the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer was lower than that of the planarization layer. The change of thickness of the planarization layer from 1 μm at the coating step to 0.6 μm after the curing step means that the coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> solution permeated into the vacancies of the nanoparticle scattering layer. The large difference between refractive index of the YSZ nanoparticles (2.13) and the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> material (1.45) within the interpenetrating areas enhanced the scattering effect. 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows optical properties of the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer. We obtained 58–78% of total transmittance of the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer at 550 nm wavelength and 24–55% of haze. It was observed that transmittance decreased and haze increased as the thickness of scattering layer was increased. This means that the thick scattering layer enhances the scatter effect due to increasing light diffusion during its propagation. Therefore, the scatter effect and transmittance can be controlled by modulating the thickness of the scattering layer. Moreover, the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer and the planarization layer have a uniform surface and a high curing temperature of 500 °C, so the subsequent LTPS TFT process can be performed easily.
