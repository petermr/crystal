  <p>Dependence of the TSL phonon modes on the period lengths. (a) Raman map as a function of the position along the NW (step size: 0.15 μm) where the spectrum in

    <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
   </xref>c was acquired. A SEM image of this NW is displayed on the left side of the map. Period decreases with increasing position, as indicated in the SEM image. The map was recorded in the 
   <italic>x̅</italic>(
   <italic>yy</italic>)
   <italic>x</italic> configuration in order to highlight TSL-related features, and each line in the color plot was normalized to its maximum intensity (TO mode). (b) Raman spectra extracted from the map in the positions indicated by the arrows and dashed lines in (a). The 
   <italic>x</italic>-scale is changed from panel a to panel b for sake of clarity.
