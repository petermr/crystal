<p>Unlike conventional semiconductors, where their valence bands consist of p orbitals and conduction bands consist of s orbitals, the valence bands of 2D and 3D perovskites are mainly composed of p orbitals of halogens hybridized with the s orbitals of metals, while the conduction bands are emphatically made of the p orbitals of metals. In lead iodideâ€“based perovskites, the valence band is relevant to the orbitals of I 5p and Pb 6s, and Pb 6p orbitals for conduction band.[qv: 44b] Therefore, both metal substitution and halogen doping can affect the bandgap of perovskites to achieve the desired properties.</p>
