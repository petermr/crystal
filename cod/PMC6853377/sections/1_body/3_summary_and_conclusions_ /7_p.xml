<p>In conclusion, the present development towards large-area 
 <italic>k</italic>-imaging at hard X-ray energies facilitates two key applications: mapping of bulk band structures, parallel in several BZs (Figs. 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref> and 5
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> ▸</xref>) enhancing recording efficiency by summing up several equivalent BZs; and fast recording of full-field core-level XPD patterns with Kikuchi-type diffraction signature and many filigrane details (Figs. 7
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> ▸</xref> and 8
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>), which provide a sensitive tool probing geometric structure. Structural and electronic information are obtained quasi-simultaneously in an identical setup. This property makes high-resolution hard X-ray 
 <italic>k</italic>-microscopy a powerful tool for real-time observation of structural changes in the lattice, and the correlation with changes of the electronic structure in core-level spectra (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> changes of local electron density) and the valence-band region. Combined HARPES and hard-XPD recording will be of particular advantage when studying phase transitions or ultrafast dynamics (see Kutnyakhov 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
