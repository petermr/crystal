<p>Magnesium adsorbs at similar surface locations to those observed with Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> on the (001) and (110) surfaces (

 </xref>e). However, unlike the simulations with Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup>, on the (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) surface, the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> does not align along a single plane above the surface. Instead it organizes itself into a staggered configuration. Additionally, the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> displaces the water molecules at this surface, increasing the bond length between the water oxygen and Li
 <sup>+</sup> atoms to 2.289 Å, compared to 2.033 Å without Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. Change in the strength of the water–Li interaction is reflected in the surface energies, where the presence of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> increased the hydrated (

 <sup>+</sup> to 0.894 and 0.882, respectively. Lowering the stability difference between these faces is expressed as a similar size of the (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) and (110) faces on the equilibrium crystal morphology when Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> is present. Thus, the hydrated zabuyelite crystal interacting with the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions is predicted to adopt a morphology similar to that expected in vacuo.
