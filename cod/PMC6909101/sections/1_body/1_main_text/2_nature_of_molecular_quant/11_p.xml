<p id="p0135">The Franck-Condon principle essentially follows from two physical facts. The first assumes (in general, unreasonable, as previously noted) that quantum mechanics works in the field of molecular quantum transitions. The second assumes that, over the course of their classical oscillations in an oscillatory potential well, the nuclei spend a majority of the time near the turning points (see 
 <xref rid="fn5" ref-type="fn">footnote 5</xref>). Therefore, the quantum transition (see the first fact) has an overwhelming probability of occurring at these points, and consequently, it will be vertical or close to vertical. Thus, the same oscillator behaves in the same elementary molecular way both as a classical system (near the bottom of an oscillatory potential well for nuclei, where the probability of a quantum transition is negligible) and as a quantum system (near the turning points of the nuclei, where the probability of a quantum transition is maximal). Therefore, the oscillator is essentially a quantum-classical system (see also Section 
 <xref rid="sec2.5" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref>), and the Franck-Condon principle is essentially one of the most important prerequisites for the creation of quantum-classical mechanics. During the formulation of the Franck-Condon principle [
