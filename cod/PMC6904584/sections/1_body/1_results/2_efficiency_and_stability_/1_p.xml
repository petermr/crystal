<p id="Par7">We fabricated PeLEDs with the device structure shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> to evaluate the impact of the PLQE enhancement on device efficiency. PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) perovskite films with different amount of YCl
 <sub>3</sub> were fabricated between hole transporting layer (HTL) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), and electron transporting layer 2,2’,2”-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)- tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBI). A photo of an operating sky-blue PeLED is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, which shows bright sky-blue emission. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c-e</xref> show current density (
 <italic>J</italic>)-bias (

 <italic>B</italic>)-bias (
 <italic>V</italic>), and EQEs curves of the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) devices with different ratios of YCl
 <sub>3</sub>. It was found that adding PEACl in the perovskite film improved the film morphology by forming pinhole-free and smooth film, as shown by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The pinhole free perovskite film reduced leakage current and improve efficiency in the device, as CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> device showed large current leakage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c-e</xref>). The device with PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) has an EQE of 5.6% and maximum brightness of 5183 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup>. Adding 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the perovskite film significantly increases EQE and maximum luminance to 11.0% and 9040 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> shows statistic EQEs of PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) devices without and with 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub>, which clearly demonstrates the efficiency enhancement by adding YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the devices. Angular emission intensity of the PeLEDs follows a Lambertian profile, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>. Further increasing the YCl
 <sub>3</sub> ratio to 5% and 10% reduced device EQEs to 8.7% and 4.8%, respectively. The device with 10% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> shows EL peak at 477 nm with a CIE coordinate of (0.10, 0.13), which comes to blue light region, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>. The EQE variation of devices with different YCl
 <sub>3</sub> ratios closely follows the trend of PLQE change in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, indicating the limiting factor for the efficiency of these sky-blue-emission PeLEDs is the PLQE of the perovskite films, whereas the electron and hole current has been well balanced through controlling the thickness of the charge transport layers in this work (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).
