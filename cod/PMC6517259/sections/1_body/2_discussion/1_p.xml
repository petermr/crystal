<p id="p0085">To gain further insight into the interface interaction between the newly synthesized HTM and the perovskite surface, the binding energy (

 <sub>3</sub> perovskite slab (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A) was computed by DFT, see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Information</xref> for details. The obtained value (

 <sub>b</sub>) is −0.83 eV, which is significantly larger than that calculated for spiro-OMeTAD (−0.11 eV, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). This study has unveiled the greater interfacial affinity of O5H-OMeDPA with perovskite, resulting in efficient hole extraction and higher interface stability. The isodensity plots in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C of valence band edge associated with the perovskite/O5H-OMeDPA confirm the large electronic coupling between the HTM and the perovskite, showing that the HOMO orbital of O5H-OMeDPA expands toward the MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> slab. Furthermore, the HOMO energy is perfectly aligned with the perovskite valence band as suggested by the projected density of states diagrams in
