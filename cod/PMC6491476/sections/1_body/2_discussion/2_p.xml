<p id="Par12">While lacking long-range translational symmetry, the as-quenched Al-Sm glasses, like many glasses, have clear elements of short range order (SRO). In particular, these Sm-centered packing motifs, play a crucial role in phase selection during devitrification. In simulated undercooled Al-10% Sm liquids, the “3-6-6-1” motif is the dominant Sm-centered motif

 <sub>11</sub> and the

 <sub>41</sub>Sm
 <sub>5</sub> phases provides another solid evidence for the structural hierarchy mechanism of complex phase selections in Al-Sm alloys. The question remains, however, as to whether the

 <sub>41</sub>Sm
 <sub>5</sub> phase is formed directly from the glass or the 
 <italic>ε</italic>-Al
 <sub>60</sub>Sm
 <sub>11</sub> phase is a precursor for the formation of the 
 <italic>η</italic>-Al
 <sub>41</sub>Sm
 <sub>5</sub> phase. It is open to question as well why the sputtered or the melt-spun material would prefer the formation of a particular phase instead of others. The medium-range order (MRO), or how the local motifs are packed at medium range, may also strongly affect the complex phase selection. Different MROs are observed with different processing methods or thermal treatments. A laser pretreatment changes MRO in Ag/In-incorporated Sb
