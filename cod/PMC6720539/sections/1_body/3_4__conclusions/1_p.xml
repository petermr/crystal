<p>In the present work, the hydration characteristics of four kinds of Ca-montmorillonite with different layer charge densities were studied by means of MD simulations and experiments. The research results indicate that the layer charge density of montmorillonite has a significant effect on hydration properties. If the charge density of montmorillonite is low (0.375), the water molecules are mainly concentrated on the sides of the central axis about –1.3 Å and 1.5 Å, and the self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules is only 1.67 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s. As the layer charge density increases (0.500, 0.563 to 0.688), the water molecules in the montmorillonite interlayer extends to –2.5 Å and 2.4 Å away from the central axis, and the self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules decreases to 0.87 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s, 0.58 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s, and0.28 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. The concentration of water molecules in the central axis is reduced, the arrangement of water molecules is more compact, and the structure is obvious. With the increase of charge density, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> appears to gradually shift from the vicinity of the central axis to the Si-O surface on both sides in the montmorillonite layer, and the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and O
 <sub>w</sub> are more tightly packed together than that of H
 <sub>w</sub>. The reason is that with the increase of charge density of montmorillonite, the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the H
 <sub>w</sub> and the O
 <sub>t</sub> increases, more and more water molecules are bound to the Si-O surface, and under the action of electrostatic attraction, more and more Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> are pulled towards the Si-O surface; this results in the higher the layer charge density of montmorillonite, the worse the hydration performance. The experimental results fit well with the simulation results.
