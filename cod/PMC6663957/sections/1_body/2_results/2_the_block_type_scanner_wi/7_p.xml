<p id="Par54">Similar to the uniform cylinder and the Derenzo phantoms, both parts of the image quality phantom show that the new model enhances the quality of the images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). The part with cold rods inside the hot cylinder shows similar artifact as the uniform cylinder phantom before normalization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>a). After normalization, the two models visually show similar results. As for the hot rods inside the PMMA cylinder, it could be observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>c that the cylindrical model tends to intensify the central region. This is because the density of the LORs in the center for the virtual cylindrical model is higher than reality. The RC values as well as their %STDs are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> showing a higher RC and lower %STD for the block model. The RC values are especially higher for the rods of 2 mm and 3 mm diameters.
