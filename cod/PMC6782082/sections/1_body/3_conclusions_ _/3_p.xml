<p>The program 
 <italic>LSITESYM</italic>, which is able to determine the symmetry relations between localized and extended states in crystals with layer symmetry, is also very useful in the description of phonon states and electronic structure. The capabilities of the program 
 <italic>LSITESYM</italic> have been successfully demonstrated in several examples. Moreover, the utility of the program in combination with other tools of the Bilbao Crystallographic Server to obtain the relation between bulk and layer modes has also been shown.
