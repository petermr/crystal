<p>One of the variant classes of guanine riboswitches discovered was predicted and validated as a second class of 2′-deoxyguanosine (2′-dG) binders–referred to as the 2′-dG-II class (originally annotated as the ‘UCC variant group’) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These RNAs contain a first shell of ligand-interacting nucleotides whose identity is U22, C51, C74, similar to the equivalent nucleotides in the 
 <italic>Mesoplasma florum</italic> (
 <italic>Mfl</italic>) I-A 2′-dG-I riboswitches (C31, C58, C80) (red nucleotides, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The identity of the pyrimidine at position 51/58, which directly interacts with the N3/N9 face (sugar edge) of the purine ligand, is critical for establishing selectivity for nucleobase versus nucleoside binding across the purine riboswitch family (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). However, there are further differences between the two classes of 2′-dG binders around the ligand binding pocket that distinguish them. First, the 2′-dG-II riboswitches have an insertion element within J3/1 that is unique amongst the purine riboswitches (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A second notable change is that the junction-proximal base pair in P1 is a G–C pair whereas in all other purine riboswitch classes it is a nearly invariant A–U pair (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These, along with other differences further away from the ligand binding pocket such as in L2 and L3, may be important for the ability of this new class of riboswitches to bind 2′-dG with high affinity and selectivity.
