<p id="Par63">The microscope is equipped with a white light LED illumination unit (Thorlabs, cat. no. MNWHL4) and imaging CCD (ToupTek, cat. no. E3CMOS02300KPB). White light from the LED collimates and passes through the edge filter (Semrock, cat. no. FF01–650/SP-25), in order to block the NIR part of the LED emission spectrum. In such a way a visible real-time image can be monitored during the registration of Raman spectra (see Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). After that, a white-light beam is reflected by 2-in. mirror M7 (Thorlabs, cat. no. BB2-E03) and focused at the back focus of the microscope objective using a focusing lens f7 (Edmund Optics, cat. no. 47–317). Commutation between illumination and light reflection from the sample is organized via beamsplitter BS5 (Thorlabs, cat. no. BSW10R). The sample illumination unit of the microscope is combined with Raman channel via short-pass dichroic beamsplitter DM2 with cut-off wavelength 749 nm (Semrock, cat. no. FF749-SDi01–25 × 36 × 3.0).
