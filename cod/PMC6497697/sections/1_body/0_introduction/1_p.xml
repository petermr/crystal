<p>Magic numbers and formulas for nanoclusters have a long history dating to the prescient publication by van Hardeveld and Hartog in 1969 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Their insights predated the nanoscience era. Since then, we have seen magic numbers appear in 2D polygons and 3D polyhedra [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], carbon fullerenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and in a limited scope again in clusters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such diverse materials such as silicon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], boron [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and in fact over 1000 publications from the indexing service “Web of Science” refer to magic numbers in clusters. The study of the size and shape of nanoclusters is important to today’s society, since this determines not only the intrinsic physical and chemical properties, but also the relevance for optical, catalytic, electronic, and magnetic applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our aim is to update the database of this knowledge with current relationships and data, now that we have entered the nano realm.
