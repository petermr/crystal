 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> the bond distances and atom height (with respect to the position of the first oxygen atom of the second trilayer) using PP–PW (PBE+U) and AE–LCAO (HSE and B3LYP) are reported for the selected atoms of the surface layer. The surface structure is found to be relatively insensitive to both the numerical approximation and to the exchange correlation functional used.
