 <caption> POWGEN PDF data measured using the high-intensity guide from a 6.4 g sample of BaTiO 3 for a total measurement time of 2.5 h and generated with a Q range of 1–30 Å −1. Q damp and Q broad for 1–100 Å are 0.0118 and 0.0148 Å −1, respectively. Refinement results are shown for ( a) a 1–100 Å fit using a tetragonal P4mm crystal structure as a model ( R wp = 6.68) and ( b) a 1–8 Å fit using a rhombohedral R3 m crystal structure as a model ( R wp = 4.12). Data are shown as circles, refinement results are shown as colored lines, and the difference curves are shown as solid green lines offset below the data and fits for clarity. </caption>
