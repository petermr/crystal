<p>PXRD measurements were carried out with a Rigaku Smartlab 9kw diffractometer with a radiation wavelength of 1.5418 Å generated by a Cu tube. The spectrometer was operated at 45kV and 200 mA and continuously scanned from 5° to 50°. The samples were powdered and placed randomly on a silicon surface in order to avoid any preferred orientation.</p>
