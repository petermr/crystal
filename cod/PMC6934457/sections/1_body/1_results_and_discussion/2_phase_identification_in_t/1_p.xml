<p id="Par8">High-throughput micro-beam XRD/XRF measurements were performed simultaneously to map out the structure and composition of the combinatorial material chips of Ti–Ni–Cu deposited with 
 <bold>sequence 1</bold> before and after annealing at 373 K for 110 hours. The map of the peak position of the Ti–Ni–Cu ternary system extracted from high-throughput experimental observations using automatic data processing is plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>. Across the whole chip, there is only one prominent peak located between 16–19 degrees. The XRD spectrum of the quartz glass displays a broad hump. In the as-deposited state, the peak distribution of the whole chip is primarily related to the components of Ni and Cu, indicating that the crystalline peaks of the samples come from Ni and Cu. The peak position in the Ni-rich region is close to the (111) fcc-Ni peak, and that in Cu-rich region is close to the (111) fcc-Cu peak. A significant change occurred after heat treatment; the peak position of the entire sample was shifted to a lower angle. The peak in the red triangle region near Ti corner was almost invisible after annealing at 373 K for 110 h. Therefore, the peak position in this region cannot be clearly determined.
