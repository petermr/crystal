<p>The power loss of the mixer in this radar system is up to 9 dB, one sweep signal source can hardly drive the transmit chain and receive chain together. Besides, the signal bandwidth of THz radar system is so large that it is difficult to directly sample a THz wideband signal using the analog-digital converter, let alone the system has four receiving channels. To solve these problems, the system adopts the super-heterodyne architecture and two sweep signal sources are used to drive the transmit chain and receive chain respectively. This method expands bandwidth of the RF signal by frequency multiplication of a Ku-band signal because it is easy to achieve characteristics of high stability, high power, low phase noise, and low spur. The echo signal to be sampled is transformed to zero IF based on twice mixing processing, which greatly reduces the demand for the sampling rate.</p>
