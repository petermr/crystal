<p>Herein, an effective and robust wind speed sensor based on the wind‐driven TIEL is demonstrated for the first time. First, a multilayered material was constructed with a luminescent layer (ZnS:Cu+PDMS) and two electrification layers (TPU, thermoplastic polyurethane). Under the wind‐induced flutter vibration, the layers repeatedly contacted and separated with each other. Second, the tribocharges caused by the mechanical movement of the layers could generate alternating electric potential, which excited the EL of underlying phosphors in the luminescent layer. In this step, wind energy was converted into TIEL. Next, wind‐driven TIEL was integrated with a perovskite‐based PD to enable the conversion of varying TIEL intensities into real‐time electric signals under adjustable wind speed. This novel wind speed sensor exhibited a low detection limit (5 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>), an excellent responsivity of 1.72 mA/(m/s) at 1.5 V bias voltage, as well as a rapid response time (&lt;0.3 s). It is also worth noting that, the sensing performance of the sensor present in this work is comparable with a commercial sensor as it is capable to detect wind speed from 5 to 14 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>. This work presents a key step toward practical application of new environmental‐friendly light source and the TIEL‐related sensor systems.
