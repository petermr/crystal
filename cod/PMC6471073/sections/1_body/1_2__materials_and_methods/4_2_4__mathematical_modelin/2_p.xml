<p>As known to us, the fixed ring has very small deformation in the vibration of the DRG, and it also can be achieved by greatly enlarging the stiffness of the innermost ring instead of fixing it. In this paper, the Youngâ€™s modulus of the innermost ring is set much larger than the other rings to achieve larger stiffness and small deformation, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f009">Figure 9</xref>. In this way, the analysis algorithms of the free vibrating DRG and the central-supported DRG are unified, which greatly decreases the complexity of the analysis algorithms of the central-supported DRG.
