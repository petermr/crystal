 <caption> BSVSP in 2D SnTe thin film. a Band structure and the y components of spin polarizations of 2D SnTe thin film calculated by DFT. Both x and z components vanish and are not shown here. b Local spin polarizations of Sn and Te atoms for the Bloch states marked with the red points I and II in a. The blue and green spheres are Sn and Te atoms, respectively </caption>
