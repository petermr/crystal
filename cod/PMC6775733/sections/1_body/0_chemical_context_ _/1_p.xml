<p>Hofmann clathrates and their analogues form one the most famous families of compounds that are able to incorporate guest mol­ecules. The first clathrate was obtained by Hofmann and Küspert in 1897 (Hofmann &amp; Küspert, 1897
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> ▸</xref>) and was of composition [Ni(NH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>Ni(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>]·2C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>. It was a 2D coord­in­ation compound formed by infinite cyano­metallic layers that propagate along the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane. The 2D system was supported by ammine axial ligands, and guest mol­ecules of benzene were trapped between the layers.
