<p id="Par51">After the WAU, Raman beams are coupled by slit focusing lens with a self-designed and patent pending imaging spectrograph (application number PCT/DK2019/050027) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). It is a lens-based spectrograph with a transmission fused silica grating. This grating provides almost polarization-independent spectral efficiency at the level of 96%, which leads to the minimized artifacts in polarized Raman measurements and high sensitivity of the spectrograph

 </sup>. Unique feature of the spectrograph design consists in combination of low NA collimation lens with high NA focusing lens. These lenses provide magnification equal to 0.2×, which leads to the compression of the Raman beam energy down to the size when an entire Raman spectrum covers only one row on the spectroscopic CCD (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">36</xref>). The spectrograph focusing lens is a self-designed achromatic double-gauss type lens, which consists of six spherical elements (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). It has a diffraction limited spot size through the entire focal plane, equal to the size of the spectroscopic CCD (30 mm), which provides excellent imaging conditions required for the multichannel SAROM setup. The overall photograph of the SAROM setup is shown in Supplementary Fig.
