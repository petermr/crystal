The spin‐down DOS features well‐localized Co d‐states near the valence‐band maximum (as seen from the partial DOS projected onto the individual Co ions, solid orange line and dashed brown line in Figure

In contrast, the spin‐up valence band has significant contributions from both of the two inequivalent Co ions in the range from −6 to 0 eV (where the zero level is set to the Fermi energy at 0 K,
