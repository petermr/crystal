<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f010">Figure 10</xref>, we can also find that the maximum precipitation temperature of interlayer water molecules from M1 to M4 are 127.12 째C, 140.88 째C, 144.46 째C, and 156.25 째C, respectively, which indicates that as the charge density increases, the precipitation temperature of interlayer water of montmorillonite gradually increases. This is because the higher the layer charge density, the greater the number of hydrogen bonds formed by the H
 <sub>w</sub> and the O
 <sub>t</sub> (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03997-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the stronger the hydrogen bonding force on the interlayer water, the higher the energy required for the precipitation of water molecules, and the higher the temperature required for the precipitation of interlayer water.
