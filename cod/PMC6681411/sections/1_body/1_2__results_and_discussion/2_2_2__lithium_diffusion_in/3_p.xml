 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02667-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the evolution of the PCN with an increasing temperature for Li–O and Al–O. For temperatures below 400 K, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>LiO</sub> is 6, which indicates that Li is octahedrally coordinated with O atoms. At temperatures above 450 K, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>LiO</sub> starts to decrease, suggesting that the Li atoms do not have an octahedral coordination any more, which may also be caused by a partial delithiation from the positively charged layers. Above 650 K, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>LiO</sub> stops decreasing and fluctuates around 2 with the further increasing temperature.
