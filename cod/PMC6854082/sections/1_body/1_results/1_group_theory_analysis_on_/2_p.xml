<p id="Par6">The essence of BSVSP manifests in a non-degenerate band at a given crystal momentum 
 <bold>k</bold> lacking net spin polarizations in an inversion-asymmetry crystal, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. As such, the BSVSP effect cannot be realized in nonmagnetic centrosymmetric crystals, where Kramers theorem implies that all bands are at least two-fold degenerate (spin degeneracy). Note that BSVSP does not mean the Bloch states are spinless since the expectation value of

 <sup>2</sup> is not zero. In order to realize BSVSP at a given momentum 
 <bold>k</bold>, two conditions should be simultaneously satisfied: (1) The eigenstate—including SOC—should be non-degenerate, suggesting that the little space group associated with 
 <bold>k</bold> should possess at least one 1D double-valued IR; (2) The little point group associated with 
 <bold>k</bold> should be a non-pseudo-polar point group. Detailed analysis based on group theory (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) suggests that BSVSP can not only occur in systems with symmorphic space groups, but also in systems with non-symmorphic space groups. In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we list all the possible 4 symmorphic space groups which might display BSVSP. The corresponding high-symmetry lines where BSVSP takes place are also given. For a given non-symmorphic space group, one first finds out the possible k-points on the Brillouin zone boundary where the corresponding little point group has at least one 1D double-valued IRs. Then, among these k-points, one finds out the subset of the k-points whose corresponding little point group is non-pseudo-polar. To detect BSVSP in experiment, one can use, for example, spin-polarized angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
