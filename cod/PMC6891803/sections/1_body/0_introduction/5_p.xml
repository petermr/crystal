<p>Although various epitaxial VANs have been studied in the last decade,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
 </sup> the successful realization of two-phase epitaxial VANs has remained limited to specific material combinations: for example, ferroelectrics (BaTiO
 <sub>3</sub>, BiFeO
 <sub>3</sub>, and PbTiO
 <sub>3</sub>) with ferromagnets (CoFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, NiFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, MgFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, La
 <sub>0.7</sub>Sr
 <sub>0.3</sub>MnO
 <sub>3</sub>, and Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>); BiFeO
 <sub>3</sub> ferroelectric with LaFeO
 <sub>3</sub> antiferromagnets; and a ZnO insulator with a La
 <sub>0.7</sub>Sr
 <sub>0.3</sub>MnO
 <sub>3</sub> ferromagnet. No lithium-based VANs have yet been explored for energy storage, while 3D solid-state batteries offer great promise for enhanced energy and power densities.

 </sup> The potential advantages of VAN-based lithium-ion batteries are a larger electrode/electrolyte contact area leading to higher (dis)charge rates; short path lengths for both electronic and Li-ion transport leading to a higher lithium-ion flux (also permitting the usage of materials with low electronic or ionic conductivity); better accommodation of the strain during lithium insertion/extraction; and interface reactions not available in bulk materials.
