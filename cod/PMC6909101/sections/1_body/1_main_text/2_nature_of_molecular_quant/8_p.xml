<p id="p0120">Returning to the qualitative physical consideration: “Under what condition is a light electron able to move nuclei with substantial inertia and thereby allow the reorganization of the nuclear subsystem in molecular quantum transitions?” [

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 33b]. The electron should abandon attempts to move the nuclei “alone” but somehow provoke the same nuclei to move. How does this occur if the nuclei in the molecule have at least vibrational motion and at all temperatures up to absolute zero (zero-point vibrations)? To shift the equilibrium positions of oscillating nuclei in space, their vibrational motions must be transformed, at least in part, into the translational motion of their equilibrium positions during the molecular quantum transition. This is easy to implement if the motions of the nuclei are chaotic during the molecular quantum transition. If the vibrations of the nuclei are chaotic, an electron could easily control their motion during “quantum” transition. As shown by the formal theory, which will be discussed later, electrons that bind nuclei (atoms) to molecules cause chaotic motion in nuclei in a transient state. In other words, a light electron, through the creation of chaos, organizes the motion of very heavy nuclei during molecular “quantum” transition, resulting in this transition (that is, it occurs at a non-zero and non-infinite rate as previously mentioned). This is the essence of the self-organization of molecular quantum transitions. This occurs through the creation of chaos by an electron in a transient molecular state. This is called dozy chaos as discussed in Section 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>. Dozy chaos is the joint effect of the collective chaotic motion of electrons and nuclei, and their chaotic electromagnetic interactions in the transient state of molecules experiencing quantum transitions. Dozy chaos is a universal physical phenomenon, because electrons and nuclei are universal [
