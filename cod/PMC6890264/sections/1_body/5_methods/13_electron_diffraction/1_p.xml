<p>Due to the large amount of sample required for X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and low signal-to-noise ratio in XRD measurements for the samples presented in this work, ED was used instead to determine the crystal structure and crystallinity of the samples. ED patterns were measured on a Tecnai 12 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 120 kV at a camera length of 1 m.</p>
