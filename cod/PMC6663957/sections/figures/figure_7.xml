  <p>FWHM measurements for the point simulated inside the 
   <italic>Scanner B</italic> reconstructed using OSEM algorithm with six subsets and 24 subiterations. The point source is axially at two different positions: the center of the scanner and one-fourth of the axial FOV. For both cases, it moves radially till 25 mm with steps of 5 mm. The FWHM values are plotted for three axial, tangential and radial directions for the block and cylindrical models
