<p id="p0055">Now we turn to the dimers A-B and B-C along the crystallographic 
 <italic>a</italic> axis in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D. The calculated transfer integrals (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>) are 41.12 meV for dimer A-B (path 5 in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>) and 1.32 meV for dimer B-C (path 6 in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). As 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F shows, the HOMO of dimer A-B is fully extended on both A and B due to the strong electron coupling. However, the hole mobility along the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis is not high, actually limited by the weak coupling region (B-C), which compensates the benefit of strong π-π interaction in dimer A-B. The transfer integral of path 2 and 4 (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>) is 6.27 meV, contributing to a valid hole conduction in the 
 <italic>bc</italic> plane, although the intermolecular electron coupling is not very strong (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). The single crystal hole mobility of O5H-OMeDPA was theoretically calculated by using the Einstein relation
