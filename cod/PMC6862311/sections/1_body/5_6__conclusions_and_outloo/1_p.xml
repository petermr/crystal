<p>Soft matter materials are ubiquitous and have found many applications in modern technology. Usually the structural studies of soft matter systems include an analysis of the pair correlation functions between particles in the system. However, the development of experimental techniques and theoretical approaches revealed the importance of the mutual arrangement and orientation of the particles on the properties of the system. The importance of the orientational order is well-known for LCs, in which a specific orientation of anisometric molecules leads to the formation of numerous LC phases with different optical, electrical and mechanical properties.</p>
