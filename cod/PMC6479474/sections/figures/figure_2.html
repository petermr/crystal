 <caption> Comparison of the experimental Attenuated Total Reflection IR (ATR-IR) spectrum of polycrystalline melamine ( a) with the calculated spectra ( bâ€“ d). The spectra were calculated in harmonic (( b) B3LYP/Gatti for periodic (3D, infinite) model; ( c) B3LYP-GD3BJ/SNST for single molecule model) and anharmonic (( d) GVPT2//DFT-B3LYP-GD3BJ/SNST) approximation. For the calculated spectra, no scaling was applied in this figure. </caption>
