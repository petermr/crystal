<p>Despite the realization that effector ligand diversity might be a widespread phenomenon within bioinformatically-defined riboswitch classes, identifying functional variation is challenging. Based on current knowledge, most sequence variation within a class does not lead to a change in ligand selectivity (

To identify functional variants, the Breaker laboratory recently developed a new computational approach to examine established riboswitch classes for detecting unrecognized ligand binding diversity. This was achieved by using crystal structures of riboswitch aptamerâ€“ligand complexes to identify the first shell of ligand-interacting nucleotides and survey the Rfam sequence alignment of that class to identify members that vary from consensus at these positions. This approach resulted in identification of variant groups within the guanine, c-di-GMP, glycine and FMN classes (
