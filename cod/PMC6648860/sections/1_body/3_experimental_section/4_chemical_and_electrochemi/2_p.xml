<p>Chemical oxidation tests were performed by reacting 200 mg of the sample with NO
 <sub>2</sub>BF
 <sub>4</sub> (Alfa Aesar, 96%) in 1:4 mol/mol ratio, in 50 mL of anhydrous ACN (Alfa Aesar, 98%). The reaction was carried out under reflux, with continuous Ar bubbling within the reaction vessel. After 10 h, the obtained dispersion was vacuum-filtered and the collected powder was rinsed with anhydrous ACN and dried under vacuum before being subjected to XRD analysis.
