<p>Few examples of Equation (7) by mechanical milling have been reported. This absence of data can be related to the instability of some alanates and the consequent difficulty of their synthesis. Among the examples is the work of Hlova et al. [

 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They produced the reaction of LiH with AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> or NaH with AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> in several molar proportions, with the objective of forming AlH
 <sub>3</sub>. Besides forming AlH
 <sub>3</sub>, they formed mixtures of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>-LiAlCl
 <sub>4</sub>-Li
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub> or NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>-NaAlCl
 <sub>4</sub>-Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub>, respectively, under 345â€“350 bar of hydrogen pressure. In another example, Dymova et al. reacted 2MgH
 <sub>2</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> to form Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> and MgCl
