<p>The alloying of Nb-silicide based alloys with Sn increases their oxidation resistance and suppresses pest oxidation, but does not eliminate scale spallation at high temperatures. The synergy of Al and Sn with Si and Ti improves scale adhesion. Oxidation at low and high temperatures is accompanied by the formation of Sn rich areas below the scale at the substrate/scale interface where Sn rich intermetallic phases are formed and Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub> is also present. The properties of the former, which include TM
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>X compounds, are important for the retention or spallation of the scale. In this paper, we focused on the Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al, Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si, Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al and Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si intermetallics for which data is not available in the literature. The aforementioned compounds and their constituent elements were studied using first-principles calculations. The enthalpy of formation of the intermetallic phases; the elastic constants; bulk (B), shear (G) and Young’s moduli; Poisson’s ratio (ν); and Debye temperature were calculated and are reported for the first time. We used Pugh’s G/B index of ductility, ν and the Cauchy pressures to deduce the ductile or brittle nature of these compounds. Based on our results, the Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al and Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si compounds are the most and least ductile phases, respectively, and Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si is the stiffest and most resistant to deformation. All the ternary intermetallics are more ductile than the βNb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub>.
