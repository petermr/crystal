<p>The oxidation of Nb-silicide based alloys, which was a matter of concern in the early stages of their development, has improved significantly both in the pest oxidation regime and at high temperatures using different alloying strategies [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the choice of alloying additions and their concentrations in the alloy is restricted by the need to achieve a balance of ambient, intermediate and high temperature properties [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Improving the adhesion of the scale formed at high temperatures on alloys that do not pest continues to be a challenge. The motivation for the research presented in this paper was to study the properties of one of the phases that can form in the microstructure of the alloy/scale interface at high temperatures.
