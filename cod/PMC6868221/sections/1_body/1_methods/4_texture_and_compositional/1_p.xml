<p id="Par18">The changes in the crystal structure, chemical compositions, lattice parameter and crystal domain size were examined with XRD analysis using a facility, Rigaku Ultima III, where the measurements integrate the data on the overall horizontal surface of the processed disk. The diffraction patterns were obtained using Cu-K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation in a Bragg-Brentano configuration with a scanning speed of 1°/min and a step size of 0.01°. The analytical software package MAUD
 <sup>

 </sup>, which is based on the Rietveld method, was used to identify and quantify the amounts of compounds from these XRD profiles.
