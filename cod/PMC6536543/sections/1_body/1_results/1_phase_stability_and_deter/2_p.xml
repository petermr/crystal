<p id="Par7">Powder diffraction data present intensities that do not correspond to perfect randomly oriented powder, so only peak positions and not relative intensities could be used to the structural analysis. In other words, from powder diffraction data, we could only accurately infer the lattice parameters of the mineral upon compression (see an example of LeBail refinement in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> of SI). Indexations and profile fittings of the powder XRD patterns up to 22 GPa, the maximum pressure reached in this study, suggest that the structure can be described by a monoclinic space group and comparable unit cell dimensions in the whole pressure range. However, the evolution of the lattice parameters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the monoclinic beta angle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and unit-cell volume (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) as a function of pressure evidence a clear discontinuity at 8–9 GPa. More specifically, according to our experiments (calculations), the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis does not change noticeably, but 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> axes decrease at the transition about 0.2 (0.5) and 1.3 (1.5)%, respectively, and the 
 <italic>β</italic> monoclinic angle suddenly decreases about 0.28 (0.12)°, giving as a result a unit cell contraction of about 1.5 (2.1)%. It is worth noting that the low symmetry and the large unit cell parameters preclude an unequivocal space group assignment, since numerous reflections overlap in powder XRD patterns. This problem is accentuated upon compression with the progressive broadening of the XRD reflections.
