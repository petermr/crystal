 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> The black line representing Malus' law fits well with the experimental data represented by the open circles for both rods. The measured polarization ratio for the aligned red and green QR were 7.8:1 and 7:1 respectively, confirming the high‐quality alignment of QRs in the QREF.[qv: 17b,20b,41]
