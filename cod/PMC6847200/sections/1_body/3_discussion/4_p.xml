<p>The ability of a riboswitch to respond to multiple chemically similar compounds may be fairly common. Examples of this behavior include the 
 <italic>glmS</italic> riboswitch that can interact with both activating and inhibitory metabolites (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), the class-II cobalamin riboswitches, some of which bind the biologically active forms of B
 <sub>12</sub> with near equal affinities (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and THF riboswitches that bind to a spectrum of reduced folates (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). This behavior may enable these riboswitches to respond to metabolic and physiological states of the cell that cannot be readily sensed by interacting with a single compound within a pool of related metabolites.
