 <italic>T</italic>), 
 <italic>b</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>), 
 <italic>c</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) and 
 <italic>V</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) above 370 K is violated, and the fluctuations of the parameters and the cell volume do not exceed the measurement error. However, the jump of 
 <italic>b</italic> = –0.01 Å at 370 K is not a random ejection, as confirmed by a gradual increase in 
 <italic>b</italic> with increasing temperature. In the same temperature range, the invar effect is observed in the dependences 
 <italic>a</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) and 
 <italic>c</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>). At 
 <italic>T</italic> = 450 K, a break is seen on all dependences, after which 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> practically do not change with increasing temperature, and the parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> behaves unstable. At cooling the sample, 
 <italic>a</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>), 
 <italic>c</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) and 
 <italic>V</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) repeat their progress as during the heating process, except for the interval 390–370 K, where they all have a weakly pronounced maximum at 373 K. At cooling 
 <italic>b</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) there is no change in the slope; in the interval 523 &gt; 
 <italic>T</italic> &gt; 440 K, a decrease in 
 <italic>b</italic> occurs monotonously. The temperatures of the anomalies appearance indicate their possible connection with the water adsorption from the air, its decomposition and incorporation into the interlayer space of the NCN1.00 structure. This should lead to the increase in the cell parameter b, as it includes the width of the perovskite layer and the width of the interlayer space. If this assumption is correct, then at heating the sample in the region of 373 K, the desorption of water should occur and, as a result, a decrease in 
 <italic>b</italic>, which is seen in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> b.
