<p>In diamond turning, the combined effect of plastic side flow, burnishing in relation to the flank face and material spring back is defined as the swelling effect. Researchers further defined the swelling ratio as the proportion between the actual height of measured surface and its nominal height, which can also be employed in the modelling of surface topography. For instance, Cheung et al. defined the local swelling ratio

  <sub>i</sub>

 <italic>i</italic>th radial section as the square root of the ratio of the power spectral density for the measured surface profile in one feed rate and the nominal surface roughness spectrum [

Similarly, Chen et al. reported that the average swelling ratio could be determined as the ratio of the average height of the measured surface profile to the height of nominal surface profile [

Meanwhile, their investigations all demonstrated that the swelling ratio is easily affected by the spindle speed in the actual cutting experiments. Herein, the corresponding theoretical results for the material spring back function are summarized in
