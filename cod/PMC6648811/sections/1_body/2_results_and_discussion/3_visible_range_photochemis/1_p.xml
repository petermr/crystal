<p>The above experiments demonstrated that 
 <bold>1</bold> is photolabile toward NO release in fluid media. However, the question remains whether this photolability would lead to ready NO release from the PDs infused with PetACrONO. To address this point, a series of PDs were prepared from different commercial silicone-based polymer formulations (NuSil) and were infused with PetACrONO using the highly self-consistent procedures described in the 
 <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Experimental Section</xref>. The silicone polymers used to fabricate the PDs are proprietorial, commercial formulations currently in use for in vivo biomedical applications. These proprietary biocompatible formulations may include different quantities of monomers, cross-linkers, resins, silica, processing aids, fillers, inhibitors, and catalysts that are designed to control the desired properties such as appearance, optical clarity, viscosity, specific gravity, tensile and tear strengths, gas permeability, etc. In all of the cases, the polymer disks appeared to be optically clear or translucent.
