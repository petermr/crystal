 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0143" ref-type="ref">143</xref> It is worth mentioning that the highest EQE for blue light at 486 nm is up to 6.2% with a luminance of 3340 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup> at 8 V and the EQE reaches 10.1% at 506 nm. The first article on lead‐free 2D perovskite (PEA)

 <sup>−2</sup>, it indicates a possible way to fabricate LEDs from low‐dimensional lead‐free perovskites. Zhang's group recently reported improved 2D Sn‐based perovskite LEDs with an EQE of 0.1% and a maximum luminance of 350 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup>, which is the highest brightness of lead‐free perovskite LEDs to date and opens up their promising display application potentials.
