<p id="p0090">The LSM images of the cross-section area of the samples (after a long-term storage) are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. NCN0.10 consists of cubic-like crystallites of ∼5 μm, while NCN0.25 is composed of lamellar grains in a wider size range of 7–20 μm, with individual plates extending up to 30 μm. Rod-shaped crystallites are likely to be the sides of lamellar grains. NCN0.55 possesses loose structure with lamellar large grains up to 15 μm and rod-like crystallites with sizes from 2 to 5 μm. Such morphology may be due to the presence of several phases in the sample. The structure of NCN1.00 is uniform, dense, the shape of the grains is lamellar and the grain size varies from 5 to 10 μm.
