<p>Encouraged by the evidence of both coordinative flexibility and non‐innocent reactivity already displayed by the phosphinine ligand 
 <bold>L</bold> during the synthesis of compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, we proceeded to investigate the reactivity of this complex towards CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Thus, a THF solution of 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> was charged with CO
 <sub>2</sub> (1 atm) at room temperature (Scheme 
 <xref rid="anie201909240-fig-5002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Gratifyingly, an immediate colour change from deep purple to deep green was observed, and 
 <sup>31</sup>P{
 <sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectroscopy confirmed the complete consumption of 
 <bold>1</bold> within 10 minutes with concomitant formation of two major new species, identified by signals at 97.0 and 116.0 ppm, with the former splitting into a triplet in the proton‐coupled 
 <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectrum (
 <sup>3</sup>
 <italic>J</italic>
 <sub>P‐H</sub>=13 Hz). The species corresponding to these two resonances could be separated by fractional crystallisation, and the identity of both was established by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction studies (Figure
