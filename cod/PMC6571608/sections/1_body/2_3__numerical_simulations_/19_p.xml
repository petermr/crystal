<p>Additionally, it can be seen that recording by two waves with orthogonal circular polarization leads to the formation of polarization grating with a more pronounced harmonic character compared to the structure recorded with linear orthogonal polarized waves, since in this case there is no modulation of ellipticity. However, in this case, even harmonics also make the main contribution.</p>
