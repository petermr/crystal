 <caption> Spectroscopic measurements of 2D perovskite (PEA) 2PbI 4 under high pressure. The dotted arrows in all panels point to the direction of increasing pressure. ( A) PL spectra excited by 2.62-eV (473-nm) blue laser. The last few spectra when pressure exceeds 4.5 GPa look flat due to low intensity. Intensity axis shows real counts per second (cps) as excitation power is fixed. ( B) Zoom-in of PL spectra at pressure ranging from 4.5 to 7.6 GPa. arb. units, arbitrary units. ( C) Raman spectra excited by 1.96-eV (633-nm) laser (when emission is green) and 2.33-eV (532-nm) laser (when emission is red). ( D) trPL spectra. The smooth lines are biexponential decay fittings of the raw decay data. </caption>
