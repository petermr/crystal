<p>The low photoemission cross sections call for optimized electron analyzers. There is a fundamental difference between low- and high-energy ARPES. In the VUV spectral range the performance of an ARPES setup is limited by the maximum count rate of the electron detector. High parallelization on the detector side has led to impressive recording speeds (Babenkov

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> ▸</xref>). However, in the hard X-ray range, the detector is no longer the bottleneck in valence band and shallow core-level photoemission, but the 
 <italic>phase-space acceptance of the analyzer</italic> becomes the crucial criterion. Wide-angle entrance lens optics in front of hemispherical analyzers have reached large angular acceptance of up to ±30° in the tender X-ray range (Keqi

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb31"> ▸</xref>; Nemšák 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb48"> ▸</xref>), recorded along one line in 
 <italic>k</italic>-space. A new type of entrance optics can convert the angular pattern into a 
 <italic>k</italic>-pattern (of variable magnification) at the analyser entrance, thus giving access to very large angular acceptance (Tesch 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
