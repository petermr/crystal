<p id="Par12">First of all, we need to correlate the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> site contribution and different emission center by considering local environments of activators. The Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> emission is dependent on the CFS. In general, when the average bond length (
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>av</sub>) is shorter and the distortion indices (
 <italic>D</italic>) is larger, then there will be a larger CFS

 <sub>3</sub>LuSi

 <sub>7</sub> are 2.22 Å and 2.77 Å, respectively. The distortion indices are 0 for both LuO
 <sub>6</sub> and K2O
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedron. Thus, we believe that the higher energy emission (719 nm) peak is associated with Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> occupying K2 sites, while the lower energy emission (784 nm) peak is attributed to Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> occupying Lu sites. The conclusions of the site occupation for Eu
