<p id="Par14">In this work we have successfully presented a methodology to predict the nanoscale structural features in single-phase equimolar TaNbHfZr high-entropy alloy by using hybrid MC/MD technique involving 11664 atoms. The use of EAM type potentials within the scope of the developed MC/MD technique gradually minimized the internal energy of the structure at a particular annealing temperature of 1800 °C. The evolution of Zr and Hf rich short-range clustering (SRC) in the simulated structures matched with that of the experimentally determined local structures in terms of their local composition, morphology and habit planes of formation. In literature the experimentally determined features of SRCs required expensive characterization techniques like HRTEM, APT, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction and neutron diffractions etc., whereas the developed automated MC/MD methodology required no such experimental inputs. The atom maps of the simulated evolving structures also captured the sequence of structure evolutions and gradually evolved interconnectedness of the SRCs, its grid pattern and nodes. The success of the EAM potential based MC/MD technique in predicting the habit plane of formation of SRCs is attributed to the calculated elastic anisotropy of the matrix. As the larger sized Zr and Hf atoms cluster in the {1 0 0} habit plane, the local lattice experiences a tetragonal structural relaxation. This is evidenced and explained by the streak-like diffuse scattering along &lt;1 0 0&gt; directions observed in the simulated
