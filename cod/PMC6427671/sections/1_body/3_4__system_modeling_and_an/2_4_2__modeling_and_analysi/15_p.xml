 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01052-f015">Figure 15</xref> shows that the pressure maximum of the acceleration-induced effects was reduced to 0.016 MPa, i.e., less than 11%, which illustrates that the characteristics of the acceleration-induced effects could be described perfectly by the ARX model. In order to validate the reliability and universality of the model, acceleration data with different amplitudes were selected for modeling. Excluding certain experimental errors, their mathematical model of acceleration-induced effects was basically consistent. This approach is also applicable to solving the acceleration-induced effects of other pressure sensors.
