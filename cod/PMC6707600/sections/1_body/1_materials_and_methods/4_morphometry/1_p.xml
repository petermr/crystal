<p>Femur length, ossified shaft length (OSL), ∠FNA, ∠FNS, and ∠OBS were measured to evaluate the growth and differentiation of the femur (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). OSL was determined from MR images of fetuses with a CRL of ≥40.0 mm. ∠FNA was defined as the angle formed by the intersection of the plane passing through the lateral and medial condyles and the plane passing through the midpoint of the femoral head, femoral neck, and greater trochanter. ∠FNS was defined as the angle formed by the intersection of the femoral shaft axis and the femoral neck axis. ∠OBS was defined as the angle formed by the femoral shaft axis and the plane perpendicular to the segment of the lateral and medial condyles. The landmarks were confirmed by two of the authors (YS and TT).
