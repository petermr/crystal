 <caption> ( a) Schematic diagram of two units for non-Hermitian metamaterials. The green and orange arrows indicate the propagation direction of incident and reflected waves, respectively. ( b) Pressure strips of the reflected waves by the two units. The high maps of the pressure field are utilized to distinctly display the phase shift between two units. Here, the amplitude is normalized. </caption>
