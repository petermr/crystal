At present, there are few studies about the interlayer water molecules and calcium ions distribution characteristics of Ca-montmorillonite and their influencing mechanism by molecular dynamics simulation. In this study, according to the layer charge density distribution characteristics of Ca-montmorillonite in nature, we used molecular simulation to establish the montmorillonite crystal structure models with different layer charge characteristics, and used molecular dynamics as a powerful computational tool to study the influence mechanism of montmorillonite layer charge density and inter-ion substitution position on the distribution characteristics of water molecules and Ca
