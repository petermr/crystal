 <caption> Dominant atomic character in the band structures of Cs 3Sb (left), Cs 2KSb (centre), and CsK 2Sb (right). The size of the circles indicates the magnitude of the contribution to each depicted band. s-states from inequivalent Cs atoms in sites A 1 and A 2 are depicted in red and orange, respectively. d-states from inequivalent Cs atoms in sites A 1 and A 2 are depicted in dark and light green, respectively. The Fermi energy ( E F ) is set to zero at the VBM. </caption>
