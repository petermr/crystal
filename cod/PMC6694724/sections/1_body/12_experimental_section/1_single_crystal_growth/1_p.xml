<p>Single crystals of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn were grown by the flux-growth method using Sn as a flux. Highly purified Mn (99.999%) and Pt (99.999%) were cut into small pieces and weighed in a 3:1 M (molar) ratio, with a total weight of 0.75 g. This stoichiometric portion was loaded in a dried alumina crucible together with 10 g of Sn. Subsequently, the alumina crucible was sealed in a quartz tube under 0.2 bar of argon pressure. The quartz ampule was put in a box furnace and heated to 1323 K at a rate of 200 K/h. The content was maintained at this temperature for 24 h, for homogeneity. Initially, the furnace temperature was rapidly decreased to 923 K, after which slow cooling to 723 K occurred, at a rate of 2 K/h, for the crystal growth. At 723 K, the tube was kept again for 24 h before removing the extra flux by centrifugation. From this procedure, silvery single crystals with 1â€“2 mm sizes were obtained; the crystals are air and moisture-stable and no decomposition was observed even after several months. Under the same experimental conditions, we grew different batches of crystals, which indicated the reproducibility of the method. Several crystals were separated for further characterizations.
