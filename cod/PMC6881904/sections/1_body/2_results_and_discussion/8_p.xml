 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors, the sample of Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF

 <sup>3+</sup> was heat-treated at 700 °C for 36 h in a quartz ampule under vacuum. 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>a shows that the particle size of heat-treated Na

 <sup>3+</sup> clearly becomes larger (up to 2–3 μm) than that before. The EDX result in

 </xref>b) to mole percent in cryolite formula results in the respective values of 57.9% and 42.1%, which are close to the stoichiometric composition of Na

 <sup>3+</sup>. These results indicate that the heat treatment at a higher temperature ∼700 °C does not change the composition of phosphors.

 </xref>c comparatively shows the emission spectra of Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>:60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors before and after heat treatment. These two spectra have same band shape in the same region, but the heat treatment process increases emission intensity by about 11%. Also, the luminescence decay of heat-treated Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>:60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> (average τ ∼ 263.7 μs) becomes obviously slower than that of sample without heat treatment (

 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>d). This phenomenon results from the decreased amount of additional energy quenching centers, such as typical lattice/surface defects and impurities introduced by higher 60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> dopants. It is believed that a continuous increase of particle size will greatly increase luminescence intensity and efficiency of our synthesized Na
