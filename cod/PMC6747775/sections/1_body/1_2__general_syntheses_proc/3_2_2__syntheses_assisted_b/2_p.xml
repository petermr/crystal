<p>By means of mechanical milling, the same reactions that are described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-materials-12-02724">Section 2.1</xref> can be performed. In most of the cases, the mechanically assisted reactions are faster than the same reactions in solvents. Additionally, the need for solvents is reduced or eliminated. However, some possible problems such as the elimination of side-products (purification) or the contamination by abrasion of balls and vials must be considered. The abrasion of the balls and vial can affect the performance of alanates. Although, an experienced “miller” will know that and would take actions to reduce contamination. These actions can be: (i) Not over-milling. Extended times of milling sometimes can be prejudicial by destroying the alanate, increasing the possibility of abrasion and is a waste of energy. (ii) Check the status of the balls and vial before every milling. (iii) Replace the balls and seals periodically. (iv) Keep the milling vial in good condition. (v) Use compatible materials; there are balls and vials of other materials beyond iron-alloys.
