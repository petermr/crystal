 <caption> A single ABP particle in a harmonic trap. Panel (a): radial probability density ρ( r) for different values of D r . The inset shows a comparison between the Gaussian approximation with some effective temperature, Eq. ( 11), and numerical data for D r  = 500. Panel (b): ρ( r) for D r  = 0.3 for three values of T: colored symbols from numerical simulations, black lines from Eq. ( 12). The red line is for T = 0. Panel (c): angular probability distribution functions, g( θ −  ϕ), for two different values of T (colored points) compared with Eq. ( 13) (black lines). Panel (d): Variances of g( θ −  ϕ) vs D r for different values of T. Points are obtained by simulations while continuum lines correspond to the variances predicted by the distribution (Eq.  12). The dashed lines indicate the limiting variances obtained for D r  → 0. Other parameters: k = 10 and U 0 = 3. </caption>
