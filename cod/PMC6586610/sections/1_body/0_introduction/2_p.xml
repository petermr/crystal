 </sup>. In semiconductors, promoting of an electron from valance to conduction band leaving a hole behind creates an exciton by photo-excitation which especially finds applications in monolayer TMDs due to higher binding energies than in that of bulk semiconductors

 </sup> The spatial distance of these two particles is a result of screening effect of surrounding medium through Coulomb interaction
