 </xref>c. The transmittance remains above 70% for the complete visible range, with oscillations that arise as a result of the optical interference occurring in the layered stack. The fraction of light absorbed by the bilayer reaches 70% in the UV range at which the phosphors of choice are excited, with the remaining light at these short wavelengths diffusely scattered by the disordered pore network present in the sintered films. Hence, although the random porous network observable in the bulk of the film does not give rise to diffuse visible light, it scatters shorter wavelength photons to some non-negligible extent. The transparency (τ) of the stacks can be formally estimated with the expression (ISO 9050:2003)

Notice that UV LEDs in combination with phosphor mixtures typically provide sources with a higher color-rendering index, which could potentially minimize light pollution.
