<p>The second approach is based on the moir√© patterns obtained by filtering 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f006">Figure 6</xref>. A dual path in the analysis of the fringes has been introduced. Directional derivatives provide information concerning the elementary cell configuration. This approach yielded the configuration of an elementary cell adjacent to dislocations,
