<p id="Par11">To test the hypothesis, a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) formulation was developed to simulate indentation in helium-implanted tungsten. A physically-based constitutive law is implemented in the model to effectively capture the hypothesised mechanism of interaction between glide dislocations and helium-implantation induced defects. CPFE predictions of lattice distortions beneath indents are compared to corresponding observations from X-ray micro-beam Laue diffraction and high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HREBSD) measurements. The spatial distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) beneath indents is calculated from both simulations and experiments as an indicator of the extent of plastic deformation. The results are discussed in light of the proposed mechanism for the interaction of helium-implantation-induced defects and glide dislocations in tungsten.</p>
