<p>In the Table, we list primarily transition metals, not alloys or compounds, with the exception of the truncated hexagonal bipyramid, where only Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> was found. There has been more synthesis of gold clusters than any other element, due to its properties and stability. In the subsections which follow, we limit our discussion to specific topics related to magic formulas and types of clusters.
