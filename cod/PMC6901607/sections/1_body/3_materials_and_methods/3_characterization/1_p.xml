 </sup>. In details, to study the structural properties of the samples, the XRD measurements were performed using A Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with CuKα
 <sub>1</sub> radiation, λ = 1.54 Å operated at 40 kV and 44 mA, and at an angular range (2θ) with a step of 0.01°. The TEM images recorded by a Hitachi H-7000 transmission microscope operated at 75 kV were used to study the morphology of the samples. The PL spectra were recorded using a spectro-fluorophotometer (Shimadzu, RF6000). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Varian Carry 50 Scan UV spectrophotometer. The PLQYs were measured using a QE-pro spectrometer (QEP02037, Ocean Optics) and an integrated sphere (819C-SF-6, Newport). The NCs were excited using a laser source at a wavelength of 350 nm for chloride-based NCs and 405 nm for bromide and iodide-based NCs for PLQY measurement. The measurement of EL spectra was carried out using a QE-pro spectrometer (QEP02037, Ocean Optics) in conjunction with 405 nm UV LED chip and Keithley 2450 source units operated at 8 V and 10 mA under forward bias.
