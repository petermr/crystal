 <caption> Phase diagram of LiH/Al/H 2 and Li 3AlH 6. The blue line represents the equilibrium. Data adapted from reference [ 86]: ln ( p ) = − 0.22 R T + 13.89 ; where (in the original formula) p is in atm, T in Kelvin and Δ H R = 0.22   eV . For visual reference (bottom and right) the equilibrium of Ti-doped Na 3AlH 6 (blue zone) and NaH + Al (yellow zone) phases were included [ 88]. </caption>
