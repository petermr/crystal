<p>The mass spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> shows the molecular ion peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic>=319.77 and fragments according to the subsequent loss of CO and/or H. According to DFT calculations, the symmetric and asymmetric As−H stretches in the IR spectra are situated at 2136 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2149 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and hence are obscured by the CO absorption bands. In order to unambiguously attribute the As−H stretch in the IR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold>, we prepared the deuterium‐labeled derivative [{Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub>}{η
 <sup>2</sup>‐As
 <sub>2</sub>D
 <sub>2</sub>}] (
 <bold>2D</bold>) by the reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> with deuterated methanol. The infrared spectrum of 
 <bold>2D</bold> shows four signals for the CO ligands at 1912, 1999, 2053, and 2124 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which are in agreement with the calculated values and, additionally, a new absorption at 1473 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is attributed to the As−D vibration and in line with the expected shift due to the mass difference between hydrogen and deuterium (ν
 <sub>H</sub>/ν
 <sub>D</sub>=1.41). This is also in agreement with the observations for 
 <bold>A</bold>, in which the As−H stretches appear at 2030 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and the As−D ones at 1410–1490 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>.
