 </xref> summarizes the characteristics of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> calculated by PBE + DFT-D3. The band gap differences between the bulk and a single chain are similar in these materials. The size of the V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chain is 0.1 Ã… smaller than that of Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>, and the band gap of the bulk material and single chain of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> is 0.1 eV smaller than that of Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. The physical properties related to the band gaps and the structures of chains in these two 1D materials are similar.
