<p id="Par4">Our preliminary MMC simulations of the eutectic NaK alloy gave the thermal behavior of the enthalpy and the mass density along a computational procedure that annealed the system spanning high-to-low temperatures

 </sup>. Now we analayze the thermodynamic parameters (structure, enthalpy, system volume) exhaustively from the MMC atomistic simulations with the goal of neatly identifying the liquid, crystalline, and amorphous phases that develop along the annealing process. An independent machine learning analysis using exclusively the atomic Cartesian coordinates obtained in the simulation runs is undertaken with the goal of verifying the identification of the three condensed phases predicted by the simulation. Our machine learning strategy is based on topological parameters determined by Voronoi-tessellating
