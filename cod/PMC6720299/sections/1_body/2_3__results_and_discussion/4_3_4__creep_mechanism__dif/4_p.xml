<p>The creep curves corresponding to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f006">Figure 6</xref>a only demonstrated both primary creep and steady-state creep stages. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, at 200 ps of the creep process, the atomic diffusion at the grain boundary was obvious, and the shape of the crystal grain did not change significantly. The creep curves corresponding to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f006">Figure 6</xref>b revealed a tertiary creep stage. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f006">Figure 6</xref>b, the diffusion of the grain boundary occurred first in the model. At 40 ps of this simulation, the atoms at the inner part of the grain were diffused, and the shape of the grain was elongated significantly. In accordance with the creep curve, it was found that the tertiary creep stage is accompanied by the amorphization process. It could be seen that the model exhibited grain boundary diffusion at the steady-state creep stage, and grain boundary diffusion and lattice diffusion coexisted during the tertiary creep stage (
