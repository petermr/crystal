<p id="Par20">The experimental results presented in this work come from the Photocathode Preparation and Analysis system at HZB. The system is composed of two main chambers. The preparation chamber houses the evaporation sources: an effusion cell to evaporate high purity Sb beads and SAES dispenser sources for alkali deposition. A spectral response setup is also attached to the preparation chamber to measure the QE(

 </sup>. The setup for QE measurements is composed of the following: a tunable white light source and monochromator for stimulating photoemission, a pickup anode and picoammeter (Keithley model 6487) to measure the extracted photocurrent, and a calibrated photodiode power meter (Thor-Labs PM100D and S130VC) to measure the power of the light. At the end of the photocathode growth procedure a photocurrent measurement is taken. Green light (2.33 eV) is irradiated onto the sample and a bias voltage is applied between the earthed photocathode and the pick-up anode; the current is then measured by the picoammeter. A dark current measurement is taken and subsequently subtracted from the current measurement to obtain the true photocurrent, from which the QE is calculated. In this way, the QE values presented in this paper are obtained.
