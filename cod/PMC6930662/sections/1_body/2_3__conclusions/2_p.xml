<p>The binding energy, which accounts for all the noncovalent through-space interactions, grows with increasing size of the aggregate, as our calculations demonstrate. This phenomenon called cooperative self-assembly is proven for azoâ€“BTA stars in aqueous phases. The simulations clearly attribute the cooperativity of the self-assembly to the development of a macrodipole, in other words, to the redistribution of the electronic density. This, in turn, enhances the strength of the hydrogen bonds, and subsequently the intermolecular coupling. We find that the predictions of binding energies and the molecular coordinates in the stacks coincide with data for the photosensitive azobenzene stars investigated in seminal works by Lee et al. [
