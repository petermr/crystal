 </xref>a, several types of transition are observed. The peaks at 314 and 320 nm were assigned to Gd

 <sup>3+</sup> was expressed as the peak around 395 nm, which was the most intensive in the field of vision. The emission spectra (

 </xref>b. It was noted that both spectra of the sample of RPB were significantly better than those of sample STR-2h. The ratio of red-to-orange emission intensities (R/O),

 <sup>7</sup>F

 <italic>I</italic>(

 <sub>1</sub>), is widely known as the asymmetric ratio.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
 </sup> Low site symmetry host materials exert a crystal field containing more odd components around rare-earth-doped ions and are more favorable for luminescence of the ions than those in their high symmetry counterparts. Therefore, on considering the sum of integral intensity of red emission peaks at 611 and 625 nm for 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub>–
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>2</sub> and 590 nm for 
 <sup>5</sup>D

 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>c was presented, which indicated that the R/O ratio of RPB-20min (2.25) is higher than that of STR-2h (2.09). These results were attributed to the slight decrease in local symmetry around Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. In the decay spectra in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>d, the red emission (
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> → 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>2</sub> transition) at 625 nm was determined by the following double-exponential formula

 </disp-formula>In the formula,

 <sub>0</sub> are the luminescence intensities at times

 <sub>1</sub> mainly determines the persisting performance of materials. Sample’s defects might act as the channels of nonradiative relaxation, determining that the decay curves are double-exponential. The average lifetimes were calculate to be 2.97 ms (STR) and 2.56 ms (RPB). As demonstrated in a previous report,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
 </sup> an increase in the doping amount leads to a decrease in the decay time due to the cross-relaxation phenomenon between the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. As per the results shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>, the use of the RPB reactor increases the uniformity of doping. In other words, the use of the RPB reactor increased the effective dopant density of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> in the particles. Therefore, the fluorescence lifetime of the RPB sample was shorter than that of STR.
