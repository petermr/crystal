<p id="Par33">Finally, we would like to stress that the form of the Raman tensor given in equation (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>) is common to a doubly degenerate Raman mode in any of the five cubic point groups. Therefore, the present method and the equations (
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="Equ16" ref-type="">16</xref>) are valid for all cubic crystals having a first-order Raman active mode transforming as a two-dimensional irreducible representation (as a mode of 
 <italic>E</italic> or 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> symmetry). In particular, it applies to both centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric cubic crystal structures. Obviously, the simplest cubic structures like rock-salt or cubic perovskite have no Raman active modes at all. On the other hand, a similar approach can be adopted even for certain noncubic crystals, for example the angular dependence of the pure transverse optic mode of rhombohedral BiFeO
 <sub>3</sub>, located at 520 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, seems to have almost identical polarization dependence with respect to the pseudocubic axes as the cubic doublet modes investigated here

 </sup>. Nevertheless, as mentioned in the introduction, there are other, more straightforward optic and Raman scattering methods available for noncubic crystals, too.
