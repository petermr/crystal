 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows the correlation of fluorescence emission intensity against Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration in the logarithmic coordinates. The slope (
 <italic>n</italic>) is evaluated to be âˆ’0.073 from the linear fitting. Thus, 
 <italic>t</italic>/
 <italic>m</italic> is equal to 0.29. It means that 71% of Sn vacancies on the surface are left vacant, while 29% of them are active to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. Therefore, the fluorescence response of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs to heavy metal ions is controlled by the density of active Sn vacancies. Furthermore, it is likely to be correlated to several factors, such as adsorption energy and concentration of heavy metal ions as well as total density of surface Sn defects. It is known that 
 <italic>n</italic> is proportional to 
 <italic>t</italic>/
 <italic>m</italic>, where 
 <italic>t</italic> and 
 <italic>m</italic> are the number of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions and Sn vacancies on the surface. If Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> is replaced by another metal ion, Equation (16) is still valid. In this case, however, 
 <italic>F</italic> will be influenced, because its 
 <italic>E
  <sub>ads</sub>
 </italic> value changes in Equation (15). Thus, the present mechanism of fluorescence response could be general for the detection of a series of heavy metal ions.
