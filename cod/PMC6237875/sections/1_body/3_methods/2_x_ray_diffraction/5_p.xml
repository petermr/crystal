<p id="Par25">In the third run, DAC was compressed to 70â€‰GPa, single-crystal XRD has been measured at 5.3(5), 25.6(3), 30.3(6), 36.9(4), 40.3(5), 44.2(4), 49.3(8), 56.8(9), 65.7(9), and 70.4(9) GPa for the first crystal, and at 5.3(5), 26.3(4), and 30.1(4) GPa for the second one. At selected pressure points, single-crystal XRD was collected in two orientations of the DAC in order to increase data completeness.</p>
