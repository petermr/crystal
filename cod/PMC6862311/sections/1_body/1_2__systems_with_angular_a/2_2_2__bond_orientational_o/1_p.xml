<p>The concept of the bond-orientational (BO) order has emerged as one of the breakthrough approaches in condensed matter physics. It appeared first regarding the problem of melting in 2D crystals, where the hexatic phase possessing the BO order was predicted as an intermediate state between a crystal and a liquid [

 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The BO order is determined by a specific angular arrangement of the particles and it can be seen as the presence of preferred angles between interparticle “bonds”, which are virtual lines connecting centers of mass of the neighboring particles [

 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, the BO order differs from the orientational order of anisometric (non-spherical) particles discussed in the previous section, where the orientation of the particles can be described in terms of the single-particle distribution function
