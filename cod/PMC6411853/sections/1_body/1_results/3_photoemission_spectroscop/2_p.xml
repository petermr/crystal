For a quantitative evaluation, the core level peaks were fitted using Voigt line shapes, taking into account the natural line width and the instrumental resolution, on top of a Shirley background. The fitted peak areas were subsequently corrected on the basis of tabulated photoionization cross sections and by a polarization factor for the photon energy of

 <sub>3/2</sub>) = 0.07, and I(Bi-5d
 <sub>3/2</sub>) = 2.3. Thus, the tellurium contribution in the film equals to only about 3% of that of the iodine contribution, indicating that the film is almost pure BiI
 <sub>3</sub>. In particular, the tellurium concentration is far away from that in stoichiometric BiTeI, for which the tellurium and iodine 4d signals are expected to be very similar.
