 <p>Three co-formers of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (CNA), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and 4,4â€²-biphenol (DOD) were selected to prepare the co-crystal of progesterone (PROG) based on crystal engineering strategies. These co-crystals were successfully obtained via slow evaporation from different solutions and were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Different binding networks were observed in the co-crystal structures of PROG. The PROG-CNA co-crystal had the fastest rates and highest concentrations of PROG in PBS solution compared with PROG or other co-crystals in the dissolution experiments. This might be attributable to more stable and abundant interactions between the PROG and CNA molecules. Our investigations provide positive support for the selection of suitable co-formers using crystal engineering strategies.</p>
