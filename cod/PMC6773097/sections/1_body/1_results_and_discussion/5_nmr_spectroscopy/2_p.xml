<p>To unambiguously show which isomer was occluded inside the two frameworks we dissolved the crystalline samples of SSZ‐26 and SSZ‐27 with HF and extracted the organic material for 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis. Besides a slight shift because of the acidic condition after dissolution with HF, the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) clearly demonstrate that the isomers recovered from SSZ‐26 and SSZ‐27 can be identified as I and III, respectively. This proves that both samples contain only a single isomer, and that no interconversion occurred during zeolite synthesis and crystallization.
