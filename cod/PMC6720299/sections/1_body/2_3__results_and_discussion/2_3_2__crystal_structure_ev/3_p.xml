<p>It can be seen from the curves of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref> that the peak value of the RDF at 1400 K is different from that at 1200 K, especially regarding the decrease in the second and third peaks, and the peaks become wider and wider, which represents an amorphization process. This is in agreement with the visual observation in snapshots. These discrepancies are probably due to the fact that as the temperature rises, creep deformation proceeds, and thus the crystalline volume fraction is reduced and the progress of amorphization is accelerated in the model.
