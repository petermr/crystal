<p id="Par23">The results for the Auâ€“P interface are shown in the Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and the P-atom positions in the best structures in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. For all the clusters the success of prediction is perfect: 100% out of all 3072 model structures were correctly built. The prediction of phosphines is easier compared to thiolates due to the diminished number of possible local conformations. In general, phosphines tend to bind into a tetrahedral arrangement with respect to the nearest neighbor Ag-atom and the three nearest S-atoms as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. To describe this kind tetrahedral arrangement, at least four nearest neighbors were needed for the local environment description.
