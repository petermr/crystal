 <italic>ICP mass spectrometry</italic> was carried out using a Thermo Element XR-Optical laser ablation source with a double focusing magnet sector. Standards were prepared from THERMO-54 and MSPB calibration standards from Inorganic Ventures and calibration curves were produced for yttrium (Y) to lead (Pb) from 25 parts per trillion to 500 parts per billion. CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> with 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> crystals were grown by inverse-temperature crystallization method, which has been widely used to grow high-quality perovskite crystals. Four surfaces of the crystals polished by sand paper to expose the crystal internal. Then the crystal was cleaved into about 1 mm thin piece by using operation blades. To prevent contamination, each sample was sealed in different vials and the blade was carefully cleaned after each cutting. The samples were then dissolved in 1 mol% HNO
 <sub>3</sub> (prepared from Fisher Chemical Nitric Acid TraceMetal Grade and NERL 18 MΩ water). The solutions were then further diluted with 18 MΩ water to reach a concentration within the range of the calibration curve. Solutions were injected into the nebulizer and injected into the instrument for analysis. Each sample was followed by a washing period with 1 mol% HNO
 <sub>3</sub> in 18 MΩ water before the next sample. Using the calibration curves produced, the ratio of yttrium (Y) to lead (Pb) was determined.
