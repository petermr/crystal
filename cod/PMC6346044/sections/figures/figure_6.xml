 <caption>
  <p>Number of samples in each of the two EM clusters obtained from the dataset belonging to (
   <bold>a</bold>) the amorphous class and (
   <bold>b</bold>) the liquid class. The temperature region 130–170 K in (
   <bold>a</bold>) was identified as estimate of the supercooled liquid transition to an amorphous solid where the volume has arrested its decrease. The temperature region 220–300 K in (
   <bold>b</bold>) was identified as an estimate for the melting transition.
