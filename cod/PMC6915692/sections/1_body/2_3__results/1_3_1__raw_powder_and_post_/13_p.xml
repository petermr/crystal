<p>In order to determine the amount of W
 <sup>5+</sup> within the raw material, an iodometric titration was performed on the blue sample powder, which can easily be dissolved in aqueous solution. The blue sample was dissolved with a soda pellet and an excess of potassium iodide. The I
 <sub>2</sub> reaction product formed from the redox process between I
 <sup>−</sup> and W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions is then titrated with sodium thiosulfate (S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2−</sup> reducing ion). The tests gave an average delta value of 0.018, leading to the formula of the raw powder W
 <sup>6+</sup>
 <sub>0.982</sub>W
 <sup>5+</sup>
 <sub>0.036</sub>O
 <sub>2.982</sub>.
