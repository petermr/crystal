 <caption> Structure (thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability, H atoms omitted for clarity) of one of two trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO) 2 + cations in the independent unit determined by X-ray diffraction of [ trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO) 2]BF 4 recrystallized from dichloromethane (DCM). One DCM molecule of crystallization was also found in this unit (see the packing diagram, SI Figure S5). The bond lengths and angles for both cations are provided in the Supporting Information ( Table S1). </caption>
