 </inline-formula> for emission wavelengths of 540 nm and 640 nm showed very different rise and decay times at these emission wavelengths. Specifically, a very short decay-time for the 540 nm emission was almost the same as the rise-time of the emission at 640 nm. A short decay-time in the blue-edge of the spectrum, corresponding to a short rise-time in the red part of the spectrum, was considered as a signature of excimer formation, which occurred within the crystal with a fast kinetic rate. Small-size multimers (for instance dimers) were expected to form almost immediately, and then disappear, being incorporated into more complicated excited multimers.
