<p>The results of the cubicage performed are shown in 
 <xref rid="sensors-19-04881-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The analysis of this table leads to results that can be considered as expected. Thus, first, it is observed that in the classic AB, the main sand embankment takes place in its front part; that is, in the side exposed to the wind. The fact that classic ABs are formed by continuous walls, without openings, implies that the sand driven by the airflow accumulates in its front face, being practically insignificant in the back.
