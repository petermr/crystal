  <p>Enthalpy and mass density of the NaK eutectic alloy as a function of temperature colored by the EM cluster each point belongs to. Blue points pertain to structures in cluster-blue, which shows to contain all the crystalline structures. Black points correspond to structures in cluster-black, which are amorphous solid. Red points depict structures in cluster-red which are in the liquid/supercooled liquid region.</p>
