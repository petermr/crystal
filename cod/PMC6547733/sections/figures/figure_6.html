 <caption> Effect of electronic excitation, structure and composition on the projected density of states. Representation of the projected density of states for ( a) monoclinic LTO, ( b) monoclinic La 2TiZrO 7, ( c) cubic La 2ZrTiO 7, and ( d) cubic LZO crystals without (solid lines) and with (dashed lines) 1.6% electronic excitation and no structural relaxation. The Fermi energy is referenced by a black dashed line at 0â€‰eV. </caption>
