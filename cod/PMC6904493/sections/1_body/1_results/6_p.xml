<p id="Par12">In Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> we show our theoretical specific heat at constant pressure, C
 <sub>P</sub>, together with the direct measurements

 </sup>. For clarity, the error bars of the observed data are not included in the plot but can be found in the original report. However, the theoretical C
 <sub>P</sub> values are safely within all these error bars and the agreement is very favorable, suggesting that our calculated phonon density of states is rather accurate as well.
