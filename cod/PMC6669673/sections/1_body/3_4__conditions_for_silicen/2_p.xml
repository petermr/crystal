<p>Considering that silicene can grow on a Ag (110) surface by deposition of Si atoms, we calculated the FE of a silicene grain consisting of 35 Si atoms in hexagon arrangement with one Si atom adhered to the zigzag (

According to thermodynamics, if the free energy for the zigzag adherence (FEZ) equals the one for the armchair adherence (FEA), then both the zigzag and armchair edge of the grain are able to grow larger. Otherwise, the future Si atoms deposited on the Ag surface would more favorably arrive at the zigzag (or armchair) edge if FEZ is lower (or larger) than FEA, resulting in development of only one of the edges to form a band (or nanoribbon).
