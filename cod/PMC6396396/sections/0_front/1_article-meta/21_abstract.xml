 <p>The benefit of computational methods applying density functional theory for the description and understanding of modulated crystal structures is investigated. A method is presented which allows one to establish, improve and test superspace models including displacive and occupational modulation functions from first-principles calculations on commensurate structures. The total energies of different configurations allow one to distinguish stable and less stable structure models. The study is based on a series of geometrically optimized superstructures of mullite (Al
