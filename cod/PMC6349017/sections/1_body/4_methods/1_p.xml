<p>The potential energy surfaces of the ZnO–liquid-water interfaces were described by a high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP), that we previously developed and validated for the ZnO–liquid-water interface using training data for both the ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surface in contact with liquid water.
 <xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The NNP was parameterized to reproduce dispersion-corrected DFT-calculated energies and forces at the RPBE-D3 level of theory.
 <xref rid="cit47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> RPBE-D3 has been shown to describe liquid water,
