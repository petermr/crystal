<p id="Par30">The grain orientations obtained from Raman scattering are in a quite good agreement with the results obtained from EBSD technique. It is worth noting that GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub> is a semiconductor with a sizeable absorption at the wavelength of the laser used for the present Raman scattering experiment. Consequently, the Raman scattering is collected from the top submicron layer of the investigated surface. In more transparent materials, optic method may show more deviations from the EBSD technique simply because the Raman scattering would be averaging a deeper volume. To some extent, if needed, the penetration depth could be tuned by selection of the laser wavelength. The vertical resolution would be more coarse but, in principle, one can possibly seek information about the depth profile by using confocal Raman microscopy.
