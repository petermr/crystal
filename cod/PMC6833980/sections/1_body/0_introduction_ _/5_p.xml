<p>In this paper, we will report on the measurement of IFRB, IFTB, IFLSD and IFLST from a weakly bent Si plane-parallel crystal for β &lt; 0 and the comparison of these interference fringes with those for β &gt; 0. We will analyse the interference fringes of IFRB and IFTB based on the dynamical theory of diffraction for a distorted crystal and reveal some characteristics of them for β &lt; 0.</p>
