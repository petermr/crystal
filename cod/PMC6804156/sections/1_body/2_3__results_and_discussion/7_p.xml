<p>The reflection spectra of undoped Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) and its fully Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> substituted counterpart Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f003">Figure 3</xref>c. The powder colour of undoped Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) was yellowish what is in good agreement with reflection spectra. The host material slightly absorbs the violet-blue radiation, hence, the yellowish tint of the powder. The fully Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> substituted compound, in turn, was white. There are also several sets of absorption lines originating from the intraconfigurational transitions of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions that very well match the lines observed in excitation spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The simplified energy level diagram of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f003">Figure 3</xref>e with the most intensive transitions marked.
