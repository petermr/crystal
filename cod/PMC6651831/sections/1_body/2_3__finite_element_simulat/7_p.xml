<p>The surface temperature was averaged on the top surface of each finite element model. The maximum temperature difference in each case was calculated by subtracting the heat sink temperature by the averaged cooling surface temperature. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In general, the mathematical model results agreed well with the finite element simulation results with at most a 10% difference. These small discrepancies were mainly caused by the secondary dimensional flux that was previously discussed. The only exception in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> was the case for the cylindrical fiber with f = 0.1 under configuration I, where the ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> calculated using the mathematical model was more than 10% higher than the finite element simulation result. This was because under small or large fiber volume fraction cases, the homogeneity of the composite was very poor, which conflicts with the assumption in the mathematical model. The differences between the two configurations also agreed with the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f003">Figure 3</xref>, which emphasized the significant effect of the component material’s local property axes alignment in the composite coordinate system. During the finite element analysis, it was found that the size of the fibers has a slight influence on the TE performance. In anisotropic thermoelectric composites, smaller fibers provide the composite with better homogeneity. Although, under the same volume fraction of fibers the cooling capacity of the composite may not vary much with the size of the fibers, large fiber geometry is likely to cause higher temperature fluctuations in between the boundaries of the fibrous phase and the matrix phase.
