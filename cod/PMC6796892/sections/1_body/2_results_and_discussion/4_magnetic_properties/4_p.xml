<p>We know that the electrons present in the vicinity of Fermi level actively participate in electrical conduction and magnetic exchange interactions. So we have used the integrated values of the orbital-projected DOS, i.e., from 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub> to −1 eV, to study the orbital ordering. We have used the same procedure for OO study as given in our previous studies,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>
 </sup> and such analysis provides not only the OO pattern but also a pictorial illustration of the orientation of a particular d orbital. The OO patterns for ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>
 </xref>. It can be seen that the V atom has a d
 <sub>
  <italic>xy</italic>
 </sub> pattern OO in the ferroelectric phase. This type of orbital ordering in PVO strengthens the intraplanar V–O–V interactions and also stabilizes the 2D magnetism. Hence, the magnetic and orbital ordering are ingeniously coupled with the lattice distortion and ionic displacements that result in strong magnetoelectric coupling. But in the cubic paraelectric case, the V–O–V interactions are strong enough to create an itinerant-electron band with all of the t
 <sub>2g</sub> orbitals partially filled. So, the OO pattern for paraelectric phase does not show a particular manner of ordering from any of the t
 <sub>2g</sub> orbitals. This weakens the exchange coupling and stabilizes a nonmagnetic ground state.
