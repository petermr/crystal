<p id="Par27">A Derenzo phantom with spherical sources of 1.0, 1.2, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0 mm diameter was simulated inside this scanner. The spheres were filled with 500 MBq of 
 <sup>18</sup>F and located inside a water cylinder with 25 mm diameter. The activity was distributed uniformly inside the spheres. Simulation was performed for 5 s.
