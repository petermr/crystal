<p>In these two‐phase transformation sequences, the (Mg+Fe)/Si ratio is between 1 and 2 (1 for orthopyroxene and 2 for olivine). Although these two sequences explain a majority of seismological observations, the role of some minor phases is often invoked to explain some geological observations. An important case is the anhydrous phase B (Anh‐B), which has an unusually high (Mg+Fe)/Si ratio (2.8; Finger et al.,

 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) investigated the stability of Anh‐B and suggested that it be an explanation of the so‐called X discontinuity that has been reported at 275‐ to 345‐km depth in several subcontinental and subduction zone environments. Yuan et al. (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) extended such a study to higher pressures and proposed that Anh‐B could offer an alternative interpretation of the origin of the paragenesis of olivine and periclase found in some natural diamonds.
