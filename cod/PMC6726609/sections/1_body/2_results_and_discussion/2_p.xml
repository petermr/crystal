<p id="Par12">From the SEM images of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), we can distinctly observe the ultrafine nanowires (about 50 nm in diameter). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the low-magnification SEM image, which indicates that the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires are attached to the surface of Ni foam. As exhibited in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, the length of nanowires on nickel foam was approximately 1.2 um. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> shows that energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) image of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires. The appearance of characteristic peaks of elements confirms the existence of corresponding elements (Ni, Au, Co, N, C and O). In addition to Au and Ni elements (they come from the gold target and nickel foam, respectively), C and N elements arrives from the anions of the intercalated structure of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> material, which is consistent with the FTIR spectrum analysis. The Co:C:N:O elements ratio of the as-fabricated α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires is 12.3: 23.4:9.3:54.9. The molar ratio of C element is higher than that of Co, which indicates that there are abundant anions in the two-dimensional spacing of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. In addition, the sample α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and Ni foam can be clearly recognized by SEM and mapping distribution in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e–g)</xref>, which further indicates that the synthesized cobalt material grows uniformly on the nickel foam. The mapping measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>) show that the distribution of the Co, C, N and O elements. The skeleton structure formed by the distribution of the uniform color representing different elements are similar, which illustrates the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> present uniform distribution on the surface of nickel foam.
