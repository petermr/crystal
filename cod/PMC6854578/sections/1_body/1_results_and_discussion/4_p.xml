<p>From

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>, one can find another interesting feature, namely, the first layer is composed of a few sublayers. Each sublayer can be distinguished by the different 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> or 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>. We find that the sum of 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>w</sub> is approximately a constant, which can be seen from 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>. For Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>â€“</sup>, the sum is around 5 and 6, respectively. In other words, if an ion coordinates with more counter ions, it will coordinate with less water molecules. If the density profile of the first layer is approximated by the Gaussian distribution, we find that the major difference among sublayers is the position of peak, not the half-width.
