<p>In the next step, the constraint of equal position was removed and the boron atom slightly pushed inward the icosahedron, to provide some bias for the least-squares routine. The refinement improved with lower

 <sub>1</sub> and Δρ (see model 
 <bold>1</bold> in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>). The distance between B
 <sup>p</sup> and Si
 <sup>p</sup> atoms at the polar position was 0.38 Å, which compared very well with the original distance of the 
 <italic>Q</italic>-peak. Although exo-distances of 1.98 Å between B
 <sup>p</sup> and Si
 <sup>p</sup> atoms are reasonable, this model has a different shortcoming: The site occupancy for Si
 <sup>p</sup> increased to 44%, which translates to an unreasonable composition SiB
 <sub>2.00(1)</sub>. A large and negative 
 <italic>Q</italic>-peak of −4.99 e/Å
 <sup>3</sup> on the B
 <sup>p</sup> atom clearly indicated the flawed occupancy of this model.
