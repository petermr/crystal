<p id="Par18">Summarizing, an earlier not reported tetragonal phase in epitaxially strained GdMnO
 <sub>3</sub> films onto STO(001), with a thickness up to 35 nm, was ascertained. Another remarkable outcome is the stabilization of a ferroelectric phase below 32 K. From the relative low saturation value of the in-plane component of the spontaneous electric polarization and the broad shape of the corresponding pyroelectric anomaly, we are led to conclude that the ferroelectric phase has an improper character. The similar temperature dependent TSDC curves obtained in orthorhombic GMO onto STO(001) suggest a common origin of the ferroelectric phase, whose mechanisms deserve further studies. Thus, this work provides a guide, through strain engineering, to unravel new and unexpected phases in perovskite thin films.
