<p id="Par17">The ratio of correct S-atom positions as a function of CSE is shown for all of the examined protected Au-clusters in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The correctly positioned atoms were determined similarly as in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For all systems in panels a–i of the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> the ratio of correct atoms approaches 1.0 when CSE gets smaller. For most of the investigated systems, the model structure with a minimum CSE value matches with the true structure by nearest neighbor bonding, except in the most challenging case of Au
 <sub>279</sub>(SR)
 <sub>84</sub>, where the true structure is found among 5–10 best model structures. For the CSE, five nearest neighbors were used for describing the local environment of atoms and for all systems the corresponding error was calculated with respect to the same set of reference structures that was used in the model structure generation. Noteworthy is that the CSE separates the correct structure of Au
 <sub>102</sub>(SR)
 <sub>44</sub> regardless of the fact that the set of reference structures is considerably smaller, although the observed range of the CSE, 0.26–0.46, reflects the incompleteness of the set of reference structures used in the prediction. For the clusters which have comparable decent set of reference structures, the minimum CSE values are found consistently between 0.04 and 0.06 regardless of the size of the system. The ratio of correct atoms on the surface depends on the other hand on the complexity of the investigated system. For the simplest systems such as Au
 <sub>38</sub>(SR)
 <sub>24</sub>, all the generated model structures have &gt;85% of the added S-atoms correct but for example for the similar sized cluster Au
 <sub>36</sub>(SR)
 <sub>24</sub> the range is 30–100%.
