<p>After 60 days, the fwhm is slightly increased from 0.09315° ± 0.0004° to 0.1956° ± 0.0004°, while the ratio between the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks in the freshly made and in the aged sample is maintained. The Δ(fwhm) between the fresh and the aged sample is 0.1612° in the case of the pristine material containing only Zn(II), and it is reduced to 0.10245° when 2% of 3-CPACl is also applied.</p>
