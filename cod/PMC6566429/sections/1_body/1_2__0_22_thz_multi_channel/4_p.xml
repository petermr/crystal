<p>The echo signals are mixed using a sub-harmonic mixer (SHM) pumped by the local oscillator (LO) signal after power allocation in each channel, and the output of SHM is an IF signal with the center frequency of 0.72 GHz. In order to acquire the baseband signal, the IF signals of four channels are demodulated in four IQ demodulators and sampled by a high-speed ADC. The in-band noise figure and noise temperature are measured as 6–8 dB and 1200–2080 K, respectively, based on the Y factor method. The receiver bandwidth is 20 MHz and the receiver sensitivity is −80 dBm. The insertion loss and isolation of the power divider are 3 dB and 15 dB, respectively.</p>
