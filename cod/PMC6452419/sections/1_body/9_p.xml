<p>More relevantly, DORI not only captures the symmetry break and the charge-density accumulation but also identifies their cause, which lies in the distinct packing environment on the left and right sides of the BCA. Whereas the fact that high-pressure crystal packing would somehow induce an anisotropy within the Ï€-conjugation covalent pattern is rather intuitive,
