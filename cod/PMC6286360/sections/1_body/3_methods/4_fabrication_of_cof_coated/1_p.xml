<p id="Par17">The activated 3D-TPE-COF (~10 mg) was loaded into an agate mortar and manually ground with the pestle for 10 min to afford a fine powder. After that, 0.5 mL UV curable epoxy (Norland NOA 63) was then added to the mortar, and the mixture was stirred until a homogeneous slurry was achieved. By using a simple dip-coating procedure, the mixture was uniformly dispersed on the surface of a commercially available blue LED (peaking at ~450 nm), which matched well with the absorption of 3D-TPE-COF. This coating process can be easily repeated to ensure an even and continuous coating of 3D-TPE-COF on the dome of the blue LED. After irradiation under UV lamp (SMC-400H, Sunwheel Materials Co., Ltd) for 2 min, the outer layer was then covered with a high-quality UV curable epoxy (ACW A90535-AN) which possessed a low water permeability down to 2.7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> g m
 <sup>−2</sup> per day. Finally, the COF-coated WLED was obtained and tested at ambient conditions after curing the epoxy again for 2 min.
