<p id="Par14">In summary, we have identified a novel ultra-narrow-band cyan-emitting NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor with 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>em</sub> = 486 nm, an FWHM of only 20.7 nm and a Stokes shift of 1069 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The unprecedented ultra-narrow-band cyan emission and extremely small Stokes shift are attributed to the highly condensed, rigid framework and high cubic symmetry sites for the activator (Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>). The cyan-emitting phosphor also shows good thermal quenching properties with an integrated emission intensity of 93% at 150 °C, demonstrating that NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is a promising phosphor for enhancing the color-rendering index of pc-LEDs in full-spectrum lighting applications. By combining this newly discovered cyan phosphor NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, the commercial yellow phosphor YAG:Ce and the commercial red phosphor KSF:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> with a blue InGaN LED chip, we fabricated a warm white LED with an 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> of 95.2. Compared with that of the white LED without the NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> has been improved significantly, indicating that the phosphor can compensate for the cyan gap and demonstrates great potential for high-CRI white LED devices.
