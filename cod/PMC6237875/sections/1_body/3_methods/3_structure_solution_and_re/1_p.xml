<p id="Par29">In the experimental datasets, coesite-III was often found together with either coesite-II or coesite-IV. When coesite-II and coesite-III are found together, orientations of their 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold>
 <bold>*</bold> axes coincide, implying that lattice planes (0 1 0) of the two crystals should be parallel to each other. In the case of coesite-III and coesite-IV, we observed that the reciprocal plane 
 <italic>a*b*</italic> of coesite-III coincides with the 
 <italic>a</italic>*
 <italic>c</italic>* plane of coesite-IV. Then the 
 <bold>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </bold> lattice vector of coesite-III and the 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold> lattice vector of coesite-IV should be colinear.
