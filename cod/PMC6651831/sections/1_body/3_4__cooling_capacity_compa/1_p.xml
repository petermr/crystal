<p>The cooling performance of fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites were investigated with both a mathematical approach and a simulation approach. While the fibrous transverse thermoelectric composite can be treated as a 1D inclusion composite, the layered transverse thermoelectric composite can be treated as a 2D inclusion composite. The cooling capacity of the layered transverse thermoelectric composites with anisotropic components have been investigated thoroughly in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence, it is informative to compare the cooling performances of transverse thermoelectric composites between 1D and 2D inclusion composites. In this section, three types of anisotropic thermoelectric crystals were chosen as the semiconducting phase of the composite, while Copper was chosen as the conducting phase of the composite. The material properties are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The thermoelectric properties of Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> single crystal were measured at 300 K, the thermoelectric properties of In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub> single crystal were measured at 600 K, and the thermoelectric properties of SnSe single crystal were measured at 700 K. The Copper served as the fibrous phase in the fibrous composite thermoelectric materials; its thermoelectric properties at 600 K and 700 K are also given in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It should be noticed that, in transverse thermoelectric composites, the transverse ZT matrix is anisotropic. The study made use of engineered anisotropy in composite materials and optimized the transverse ZT with respect to one specific element in the anisotropic ZT matrix. The anisotropic ZT values for other elements in the matrix are not discussed.
