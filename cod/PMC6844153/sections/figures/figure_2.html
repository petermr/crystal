 <caption> Band gap (Δ E) changes by the number of chains ( n) of V 2Se 9 and Nb 2Se 9. calc. and interpol. abbreviate calculation and interpolation, respectively. As n increases, Δ E decreases to the bulk band gap of 0.54 eV in V 2Se 9 and 0.65 eV in Nb 2Se 9, as represented by dashed lines. We interpolated the band gap changes to exponential curves such that Δ E = 0.60 e –0.17 n + 0.54 for V 2Se 9 and Δ E = 0.70 e –0.21 n + 0.65 for Nb 2Se 9. </caption>
