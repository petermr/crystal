<p>Drndic's group reported the alignment of CdSe and CdTe QRs using applied electric fields.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> The devices used for the alignment consisted of an interdigitated electrode on an approximately 100 nm thick silicon nitride (Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>) to hold the suspended membranes, as shown in 
 <bold>Figure</bold>

 </xref>. CdSe or CdTe QRs (10 µL) in a hexane/octane solution were drop‐casted onto each device while voltage was applied to the electrodes. Local electric fields generated by nanopatterned electrodes were used to control the position and orientation of both well‐isolated and closely packed QRs. Post‐deposition imaging using TEM and atomic force microscopy revealed QR alignment in the direction of the applied field, and dense accumulation around and directly on the voltage‐biased electrodes when deposited from dilute and concentrated solutions, respectively. The degree of alignment under the applied electric field was characterized by a nematic order parameter 
 <italic>S</italic> ≈0.8 in contrast to the zero‐field case where 
 <italic>S</italic> was ≈0.1. Overall, this approach appears to work well, but it is not feasible for the large‐scale alignment of QRs, required for LCD application, due to the necessity of having pre‐printed electrodes on the substrate during deposition.
