 <caption> Snapshots of the ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surface illustrating the vehicular movement of O*H – (orange) from the intra-surface-PT coordinate (left) to a configuration where it bridges two adjacent surface rows (right). The instantaneous distances between the O in O*H – and the two nearest Zn s 2+ are given. </caption>
