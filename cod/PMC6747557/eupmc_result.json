    "In order to study the crystallinity of different density polyethylenes, this paper conducts an experimental study on the transformation of the conductance mechanism under a high electric field. In this experiment, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differentials scanning calorimetry (DSC), direct current (DC) breakdown of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), as well as the conductivity characteristics under an electric field of 5-200 kV/mm are tested. In addition, the electric field-current density curves of the four kinds of polyethylene are fitted to analyze their conductance transition in non-ohmic regions under different high field strengths, through applying the mathematical formula of a variety of conductance mechanisms. The experimental results are as follows: as the density of polyethylene increases, the crystallinity increases continuously. Moreover, the continuous increase of crystallinity causes the electric conduction flow under the same field strength to decrease significantly. The field strength corresponding to the two turning points in the conductance characteristic curve increases simultaneously, and the breakdown field strength increases accordingly; through analysis, it is found that in the high field, as the electric field increases, the conductance mechanism develops from the ohmic conductance of the low field strength region to the bulk effect of the high field strength region (Poole-Frenkel effect). Then, it develops into the electrode effect to the high field strength (Schottky effect), although the threshold field strength of this conductance mechanism transition increases with the increase of crystallinity."
