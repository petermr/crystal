<p>A set of preliminary tests were carried out to analyze the homogenization in the sand distribution along the scaled wind tunnel due to the airflow created by the fan used. An example of the results obtained can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, where a trend of sand accumulation is observed on the right side of the wind tunnel. This phenomenon is caused by the airflow created by the movement of the blades, which in its encounter with the walls of the prototype creates a small turbulence on one side of the tunnel. To prevent this effect and to try make the prototype work with a more laminar flow similar to the one we can find in nature, an air diffuser was designed and built specifically to channel and laminate the airflow expelled by the fan.
