<p id="Par18">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref> also suggests that two neighboring arcs are not equally resolved and their intensities are not exactly the same (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). This is expected, since the perpendicular domains seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> are not always equally strong and their contributions to the signal depend on the particular cleaved surface.
