<p id="Par11">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> we present the results of comparative study of Fermi surfaces and underlying dispersions by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The FS of EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) is remarkably similar to that resulted from the simplified calculations shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, apart from that Mn-states are absent at the Fermi level. This is not surprising since their computed energy localization is very sensitive to the value of the U parameter usually used to correctly reproduce the correlated nature of Mn 
 <italic>3d</italic> states. The well separated four lenses with sharp corners are clearly observed and depend only weakly on photon energy (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) confirming their origin from Bi 
 <italic>p</italic> states from the two-dimensional square net. The ARPES intensity map taken along the cut #1 illustrates an ideally linear on the scale of 1 eV behavior of these features with enormous Fermi velocity (9 eVÅ). Other states with considerably larger 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub> dispersions (which make them appear blurred because of intrinsically moderate 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub> resolution) are also seen, in accordance with the calculations. The cuts #2 and #3 emphasize another agreement with the theory—Dirac crossings are destroyed at all occupied momenta and sizeable energy gaps are opened in the vicinity of the Fermi level.
