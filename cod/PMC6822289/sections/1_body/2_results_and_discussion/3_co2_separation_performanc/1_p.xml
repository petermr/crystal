<p>The systematically optimized structures with high-quality charges, that have been obtained for 308 COFs (CURATED DFT-optimized set), allow us to model the interaction with polar molecules, e.g., considering Coulombic attractions, and evaluate the performance of these materials for gas adsorption. As an example, we investigate the use of COFs for the removal of carbon dioxide from coalâ€™s postcombustion flue gases.</p>
