 </sup> are a classical example of systems with properties controlled by nanoscale atomic order that has remained ill-understood despite over a half century of intense studies using the most advanced measurement and computational techniques. Lead magnesium niobate, PbMg
 <sub>1/3</sub>Nb
 <sub>2/3</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (PMN), and its solid solutions, which exhibit highly attractive piezoelectric characteristics, have been and remain at the center of the quest to understand the structural origins of the relaxor behavior. PMN crystallizes with a perovskite-like structure featuring a nanoscale ordering of Mg and Nb. The polarizable Nb and Pb cations are offset from their respective centrosymmetric positions, thus yielding local electric dipoles. While on average the PMN structure exhibits cubic symmetry (retained down to at least 5 K), such polar cation displacements are correlated over a local range; however, the exact nature of these correlations and their relations to the underlying short-range chemical order remain contentious.
