<p id="Par8">Next, we have looked into the magnetic properties in details. The zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) data recorded with an applied field of 200 Oe for the three compositions of LSCNRO are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a–c)</xref>. The 
 <italic>M</italic>(
 <italic>T</italic>) of 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 sample shows a transition at around 255 K where ZFC and FC curves start to bifurcate. Another transition occurs at around 27 K, where susceptibility seems to saturate. In the high temperature regime (255–300 K), the inverse susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss behavior resulting (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2(a)</xref>) in a effective moment of

 <sub>
  <italic>eff</italic>

 <italic>μ</italic>

 </sub>. The observed magnetic moment is lower than the expected spin-only contribution of both Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Re
 <sup>5+</sup> and this reduction in magnitude can attributed to the spin-orbit coupling in Re

 </sup>. For 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref>) a ferro/ferrimagnetic (FM) like transition is observed at 45 K, along with the high temperature FC-ZFC bifurcated curves. This FM like transition gradually shifts to higher temperatures with increasing 
 <italic>x</italic> (~110 K for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c)</xref>). Also as 
 <italic>x</italic> increases, the FM like transition becomes stronger to obscure the high temperature FC-ZFC splitting. The effective magnetic moment obtained from Curie-Weiss fit for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2(b)</xref>) is 3.59
