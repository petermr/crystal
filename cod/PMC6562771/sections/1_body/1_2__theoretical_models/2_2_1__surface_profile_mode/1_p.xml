<p>In diamond turning, the surface topography is generated by the relative motion between the diamond tool and workpiece. Hence, the surface profile model in relation to one feed is the elementary unit of the total surface profile. As revealed by the previous investigations, three main components, i.e., the duplication effect of diamond tool edge profile, material spring back and material plastic side flow, can affect the vertical distance between the highest peak and the lowest valley, i.e., the peak-valley surface roughness
