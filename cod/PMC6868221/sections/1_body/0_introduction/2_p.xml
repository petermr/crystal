 </sup> and for 100 turns with the micrographs taken by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the disk center and edge (center) and a color-coded contour hardness map for the material after 100 HPT turns (lower). From the cross-section after 100 turns, it is apparent that there is no evidence of a Mg-rich phase across the disk diameter of the severely deformed material where the Mg-rich phase in the bonded material tends to appear in a darker color at the mid-plane as seen in the 1-turn sample. The current HPT procedure maintained a constant volume of material without any significant change during 1 to 100 turns by HPT, thereby implying the presence of reasonably consistent volume fractions of Mg in the Al-Mg system after HPT from 1 to 100 turns. It should be noted that segregation and a crack are visible at the lower left of the severely processed disk but this occurred during the molding and cutting after the HPT processing.
