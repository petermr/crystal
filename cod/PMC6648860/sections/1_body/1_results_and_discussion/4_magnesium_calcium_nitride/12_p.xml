<p>While CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> is predicted as a stable phase in the ternary Ca–Ta–N phase diagram at 0 K, the negative total energy of reaction 
 <xref rid="eq2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref> reflects the thermodynamic trend of Ca
 <sub>0.5</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> to decompose. Moreover, under the severe oxidizing conditions employed, the formation of oxygen containing alternative phases cannot be completely excluded either.
