 <caption> Pressure dependence of the lattice parameters of tilleyite and post-tilleyite Ca 5(Si 2O 7)(CO 3) 2 phases. Black squares, circles and triangles denote the a, b and c axes of both structure-types. Blue squares show the evolution of the monoclinic β angle with pressure. Solid and empty symbols correspond to the initial P2 1/ n tilleyite and the high-pressure P2 1 post-tilleyite phases. Lattice axes uncertainties are smaller than the size of the symbols. Error bars corresponding to the monoclinic β angle are indicated. Experimental fits are depicted as solid and dashed black and blue lines. Results from DFT calculations are represented with red lines. </caption>
