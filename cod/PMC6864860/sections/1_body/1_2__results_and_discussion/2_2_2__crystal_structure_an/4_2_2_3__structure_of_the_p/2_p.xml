<p>As in the case of the DHB molecule, DOD has two hydroxyl groups which are positioned at both ends of the DOD molecule. Such a linearly-shaped molecular structure generates an extremely different interaction with PROG. In this case, DOD acts mostly as a “canal” that links the PROG molecules located at both ends of the structure rather than a “traffic hub” that holds together a complicated network. The PROG-DOD unit-cell volume measures 4121.1 Å
 <sup>3</sup>. This number is almost twice as large as that for CNA and DHB. This indicates that the three molecular pairs are arranged in an asymmetric unit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The dihedral angles of the intramolecular benzene rings in the three DOD molecules are 8.291°, 14.449°, and 27.940°, respectively. For this reason, each single DOD molecule shows a different symmetry and the co-crystal structure belongs to a low symmetry space group. The PROG and DOD molecules form the hetero-molecule dimer via synthon IV and several interactions such as the O
 <sub>3</sub>A-H
 <sub>3</sub>A···O
 <sub>1</sub> hydrogen bond over a distance of 2.747 Å and two C-H···O interactions with a distance of 3.634 Å (C
 <sub>4</sub>···O
 <sub>3</sub>A) and 3.438 Å (C
 <sub>23</sub>A···O
 <sub>1</sub>), respectively. The C
 <sub>2</sub>B-H
 <sub>2</sub>BB bond in the above PROG molecule interacts with its horizontally adjacent DOD molecule by forming a C-H···O bond. Moreover, a similar interaction exists between the DOD molecule and the adjacent PROG molecule located at the bottom of the structure via the C
 <sub>2</sub>B-H
 <sub>2</sub>BB···O
 <sub>1</sub>A and C
 <sub>2</sub>B-H
 <sub>2</sub>BB···O
 <sub>3</sub>B over a distance of 3.703 and 3.498 Å (C···O), respectively. This network generates a triangle-like motif (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03936-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The PROG-DOD dimers align along the [101] direction and partial dimers are further linked together to produce an extended ladder network in the (010) plane. The distance between two parallel dimers is about 6.0 Å. The 3D structure of the PROG-DOD molecule is generated by stacked ladders linked together via multiple C-H···O interactions. In this case, no C-H···π or α···π interactions were observed.
