<p id="Par10">In order to have more insight about the observed magnetic transitions, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) were carried out for the end compositions at 2 K. The changes in the lattice parameters, bond lengths and bond angles with temperature have been listed in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. For 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0, there is a contraction of the lattice parameters with decrease in temperature with no signature of long range magnetic ordering (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref>), which suggests that the observed magnetic transitions in the magnetization curves are of short range type. Our observation is in accordance with the NPD measurements of SrLaNiReO
