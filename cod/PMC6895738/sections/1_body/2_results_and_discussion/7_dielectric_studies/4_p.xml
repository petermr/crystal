 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) and tg
 <italic>δ</italic>(
 <italic>T</italic>) appeared by the increase in the dispersion with increasing temperature and by the maximum tg
 <italic>δ</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) at 450 K, which corresponds to the phase transition R2 → R3. The features of the NCN0.25 structure are also reflected in the 
 <italic>ε′/ε</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) dependence in the heating – cooling mode. In the heating mode, the weak maximum 
 <italic>ε′/ε</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) in the region of 370 K, most noticeable at low frequencies, corresponds to the appearance of the intermediate phase R2 (see 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Its absence in the cooling mode is due to the fact that when NCN0.25 is cooled from the high-temperature phase R3, the latter does not immediately go into the low-temperature phase R1, but remains at room temperature for several days (see 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> a).
