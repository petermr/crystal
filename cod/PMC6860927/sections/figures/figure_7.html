 <caption> (a) A tracking window is user-defined (dotted black rectangle); Hough transformation detects all the features within the frame; Dotted white lines indicate the detected grain boundary and black dotted lines indicate the zone lines. (b) Direct 3D reconstruction is performed based on the coordinates in (a); Blue points represent the atoms whereas red represent the extracted ‘GB’ points. (c) Refined 3D reconstruction with the slope filter. (d) After the slope filter is implemented, the lines with slope smaller than 2 are removed. </caption>
