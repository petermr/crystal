  <p>(A) Space-charge limited currents hole mobilities of O5H-OMeDPA and spiro-OMeTAD spin coated on the substrate of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate.</p>

   <italic>J-V</italic> characteristic (reverse scan) of a champion PSC with O5H-OMeDPA as the hole-transporting layer measured under 100 mW cm
   <sup>−2</sup>, AM 1.5G illumination. The data for a control cell with spiro-OMeTAD are also included. The inset is the IPCE spectrum and integrated
