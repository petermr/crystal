<p>Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> polycrystals were obtained by mixing high-purity elements with desired stoichiometry. The polycrystalline samples of Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> were sealed in a quartz tube with some iodine under a partial Argon pressure. The samples were heated to 1000°C over 6 hours and kept for 24 hours before being slowly cooled to 600°C over 7 days. Large single-crystalline ingots up to centimeter size were obtained at the bottom of the quartz tubes.
