<p>In conclusion, the BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors were synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. Under excitation at 453 nm, the BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors exhibited a green-yellow light with four emission peaks at 495, 535, 624, and 655 nm. These emission peaks are attributed to the

 <sub>0.9925</sub>OCl:0.0075Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor was obtained with a CIE coordinate (0.2847, 0.4439). In addition, the Bi
 <sub>0.9925</sub>OCl:0.0075Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor could also maintain a good thermal stability at high temperature. The intensity of emission peaks at 150 °C was about 78% of the initial intensity at room temperature. The quantum yield was measured to be 24.9%. The results show that BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor is a green-yellow-light-emitting phosphor, which may be suitable for application in blue-light-based w-LEDs.
