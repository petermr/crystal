<p id="p0040">Since for an ideal polymethine state, the total transfer of the alternating charge along the full chain consists of the acts of elementary transfer of a small amount of charge over a small distance between adjacent carbon atoms, the tunneling effects in such an electron-charge transfer are minor and the Gamow tunnel factor is close to unity [
