<p>High-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provides additional surface information for single-crystal catalysts (fig. S13). As shown in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, the S 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> band with a binding energy (BE) of 162.1 eV corresponds to the S
 <sup>2−</sup> configuration in Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>. This value is lower than that of its counterpart Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> (162.8 eV), which has been confirmed to adopt the electronic configuration (Ni
 <sup>0</sup>)
 <sub>3</sub>(Sn
 <sup>2+</sup>)
 <sub>2</sub>(S
 <sup>2−</sup>)
 <sub>2</sub>, suggesting a partial positive charge on Co atoms (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>36</italic>
 </xref>). In addition, a shoulder peak with a BE of 161.4 eV is observed and can be interpreted as a surface-derived contribution (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>37</italic>
 </xref>). This indicates the exposure of the S
 <sub>2</sub>-Co-Sn
 <sub>4</sub> octahedra when exfoliating the bulk crystal. High-resolution Co 3
 <italic>d</italic> spectra provide more interesting information, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. The peak at BE = 778.3 eV can be attributed to the Co (0) states in Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> but is slightly higher than the value of metallic Co (778.1 eV) (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>38</italic>
 </xref>), further demonstrating the partial positive charge. A close investigation of the Co (0) 3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> peak reveals an asymmetric line shape and a small plasmonic energy loss structure, which are characteristics of a good metallic sample (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>39</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>40</italic>
 </xref>). This is consistent with the band structure calculations, suggesting that the Fermi surface is dominated by Co 3
 <italic>d</italic> states. The BE of 781.1 eV can be ascribed to Co
 <sup>2+</sup>, which is a result of surface oxidation or loss of coordination such as S vacancies. The clearly distinguished, broad peak centered at 785.2 eV is a satellite structure for Co
 <sup>δ+</sup> and Co
 <sup>2+</sup> (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>39</italic>
 </xref>). The Sn 3
 <italic>d</italic> spectra indicate that the main peak is derived from the Sn
 <sup>2+</sup>states (fig. S14). All these results suggest that the bulk single-crystal Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> has a different electronic configuration from that of Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>, more likely to be (Co
 <sup>δ+</sup>)
 <sub>3</sub>(Sn
 <sup>2 − γ</sup>)
 <sub>2</sub>(S
 <sup>2−</sup>)
 <sub>2</sub>, with the Co atoms being partially positively charged and Sn atoms having an average valence below 2. For direct determination of the surface atomic termination, a bulk Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> single crystal was cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions to expose the (001) surface. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images were collected in situ at 2 K and are shown in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. The cleaved surface exhibits a typical Kagome-lattice atomic structure, indicating a Co layer at the surface. Such a cleave is energetically favorable because it exposes the smallest surface areas, and the S─Sn bond can be easily broken because of the large bonding distance (2.86 Å) (table S3).
