  <p>Tip movement to control the nanowire growth. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> During the period of uniform growth, the length of nanowire increased by 96 nm while the apparent diameter (∅) remained unchanged. 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold> at 57.8 s, a lateral jump of ~25 nm leftward occurred to the tip. After the jump, the nanowire showed increase in both length and ∅. 
   <bold>e</bold> Plot of ∅ and the change of tip position in the pulling direction (
   <italic>Y</italic>
   <sub>tip</sub>) and lateral direction (
   <italic>X</italic>
   <sub>tip</sub>) as a function of time. Scale bars, 100 nm
