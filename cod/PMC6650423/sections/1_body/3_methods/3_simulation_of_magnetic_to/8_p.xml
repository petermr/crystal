<p id="Par32">In addition, we demonstrate in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, the expected changes in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropies for case (C), when both mount misalignment and field misalignment are present. We note that even for a large field misalignment of 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 5°, the contribution from the out-of-plane component only appears as a slight shift of the original signal, whereas the onset of 2
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub> is clearly observed. This confirms that our experimental results intrinsically represent the in-plane diagonal nematicity which onsets below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup>. It should also be noted that when we have field misalignment, a non-zero component of 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>aa</italic>
 </sub> − 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>bb</italic>
 </sub>, would appear. This should give rise to a phase shift of the twofold oscillations, while it is never observed in the experiments.
