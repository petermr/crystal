<p id="Par3">Recently, non-Hermitian acoustics have been introduced to the 1D structure. The properties of one-way propagation

 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric metamaterials crystal in 2D space, to achieve the unidirectional sound focusing effect in simulation and experiment

 </sup>. However, until now, there has been no comprehensive analysis about the effect on the dispersion relation caused by 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry breaking in 2D acoustic systems. In addition, not confined to a curved structure, achieving the optional geometric manipulation of 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric metamaterials is a challenging problem.
