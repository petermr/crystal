 <p>Quantitative parameters of modulated crystal structures are determined from density functional theory calculations applied to superstructures obtained using the superspace formalism. The example of mullite is used to demonstrate that with this approach versatile aspects ranging from ordering phenomena to phase diagrams can be understood on a new level.</p>
