<p>Next, we explored the electronic structure of GeSe under pressure. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f004">Figure 4</xref> plots the electronic band structure of GeSe under different simulated pressures, and the projections of the s and p orbitals for the Ge and Se atoms are shown as well. The energy band structure is plotted along the high-symmetry line Γ-X-S-Y-Z-Γ-T. The zero-band energy line is set to the top of the valence band. We observed that the first valence band maximum (VBM) is located on the Γ-Z line and the second VBM and the conduction band minimum (CBM) site on the Γ point. The energy difference between the two maximum valence bands is 0.14 eV. The results confirm that GeSe in the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> phase is an indirect bandgap semiconductor. The computed indirect and direct bandgaps of GeSe at 0 GPa are 0.89 eV and 1.03 eV, which is slightly smaller than the data measured from the experiment at approximately 1.14 eV and 1.21 eV [

It is well known that the band gap is always underestimated in first principle calculations, and the main reason is that the derivative discontinuity of the exchange correlation energy between integer electrons is not captured in DFT. The projected density of states (DOS) shows that the contributions on conduction states mainly originate from Ge-4p and Se-4p. The Ge-4s and Se-4s contribute equally to conduction states, but the contribution from Se-4s nearly equal to zero. The valence states are mostly originated from Se-4p orbitals. The band profile under pressure is similar to the band structure at 0 GPa. The energy bandgap of GeSe decreases rapidly under pressure. The energy bandgap under 8 GPa is only 0.1 eV.
