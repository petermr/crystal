<p>The sensitive unit of piezoelectric pressure sensors is the piezoelectric element. When the piezoelectric element is subjected to an external pressure and deforms in a given direction, the material surface produces an opposite charge because of polarization. Once the external pressure disappears, the material returns to the uncharged state. If the external pressure changes direction, the polarity of the charge is also changed. This phenomenon is the measurement principle of a piezoelectric pressure sensor [
