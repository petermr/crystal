<p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to verify the elemental distribution and the bonding types of the exfoliated 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> nanoflakes. The prominent W 4f peaks were observed at 31.3 eV and 33.5 eV, corresponding to 4f
 <sub>7/2</sub>, and 4f
 <sub>5/2</sub>, respectively, of the W–Te bonds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> left in green), while the Te 3d spectrum has two peaks at 572.7 eV (3d
 <sub>5/2</sub>) and 582.9 eV (3d
 <sub>3/2</sub>), respectively, corresponding to W–Te bonds (

 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The crystalline parameters of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> were further studied through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where a typical high-resolution TEM image displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> shows the distorted 1T’ atomic phase, and the selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) pattern illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, which demonstrates the rectangular symmetry of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> with space group Pmn2
 <sub>1</sub>. Furthermore, graphene diffraction spots were utilized for calibrating the SAED pattern, and we measured the lattice parameters to be 
 <italic>a</italic> ≈ 3.49 Å and 
 <italic>b</italic> ≈ 6.32 Å, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with a previous report [

 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets, as shown 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. All of the peak positions are consistent with those reported from exfoliated thin nanosheet samples previously reported [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, a similar negative-direction shift of the peak positions is witnessed as the sample thickness increases [
