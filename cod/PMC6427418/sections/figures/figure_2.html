 <caption> The direction of the applied stress n → as a function of polar and azimuthal angles θ , φ , and the direction in which the Poisson’s ratio is measured m → as a function of α -angle lying in the plane (presented in the form of a green disc) spanned by the vectors m 1 = n → × z → and m 2 = n → × m 1 . All vectors are unit vectors. </caption>
