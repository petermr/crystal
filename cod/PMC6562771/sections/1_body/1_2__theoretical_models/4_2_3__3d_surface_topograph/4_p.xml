<p>In addition to the grain boundary, other kinds of defects can also be observed in the matrix of alloy materials and composites materials. For instance, Ge et al. studied the surface quality when diamond turning of SiC
 <sub>p</sub>/Al composites, and observed many defects such as pits, voids, micro-cracks, grooves and matrix tearing on the machined surface [

Tauhiduzzaman et al. focused on the influence of microstructure of aluminium alloy Al 6061, including grain boundary density and inclusions, and pointed out that using an ultra-fine grain work material can effectively reduce the influence of material microstructure on surface topography [

Han et al. experimentally investigated the formation of defects in diamond turning of polycrystalline copper, and pointed out that the dominating defect affecting the formation of surface topography will correspondingly change with the increase of depth of cut [
