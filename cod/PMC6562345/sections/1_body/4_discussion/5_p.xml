<p>At this point, we pause to consider the extent and nature of the agreement between our experimental and computational data. In addition to uncertainties associated, for instance, with the specific choice of exchangeâ€“correlation functional, the DFT methodology used here has two features that fundamentally differentiate it from experiment. First, DFT does not take thermal vibrations into account, and thus effectively simulates a classical crystal at absolute zero temperature. Second, fitting optimized energy as a function of cell volume considers only distortions at the gamma point (that is, those in which every unit cell distorts in the same way).</p>
