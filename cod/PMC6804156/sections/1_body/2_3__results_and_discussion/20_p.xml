 <sup>3+</sup> ions in inorganic matrices are relatively low [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-12-03275" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. One of the ways to deal with this problem is using ceramics prepared from phosphor powder instead of phosphor powder itself. In ceramics the scattering of the incident excitation light is suppressed; therefore, the light can penetrate deeper in the phosphor and thus excite more dopant ions. In order to test this concept, we have prepared three ceramic disks with thicknesses of 0.36, 0.53, and 0.80 mm from Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) sample. The quantum efficiency of this sample is 10% lower if compared to sample doped with 50% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>. However, the powder of fully Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> substituted phosphor possesses stronger absorption; thus, in our opinion, this trade of is very reasonable. The prepared ceramic disks were placed on three different LEDs, emitting at 375, 400, and 455 nm, and the emission spectra of the resulting light sources were measured. The obtained results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f007">Figure 7</xref>. For comparison, the emission spectra of 375, 400, and 455 nm LEDs are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f007">Figure 7</xref>a–c, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f007">Figure 7</xref>d demonstrates that the absorption of electromagnetic radiation emitted by 375 nm LED increases with increasing thickness of the Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) ceramic disc. The ceramic disc thickness of 0.36 mm is not sufficient to absorb all the light emitted by 375 nm LED; however, it is virtually all absorbed when the thickness of ceramic disk reached 0.80 mm. The Eu
 <sup>3+ 7</sup>F

 <sub>7,8</sub>; 
 <sup>5</sup>G
 <sub>J</sub> and 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>0</sub> → 
 <sup>5</sup>L
 <sub>6</sub> absorption lines are clearly visible in the emission spectra of the obtained light source where 375 nm LED emits. Similar behaviour was observed for light sources prepared from 400 nm emitting LED and ceramic disks. The only difference is that 0.80 mm thickness ceramic disk is still not enough to absorb all the incident radiation; therefore, for complete absorption of 400 nm LED emission a thicker ceramic disk would be required. Here, Eu

 <sup>5</sup>L
 <sub>6</sub> and 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> → 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>3</sub> transitions are visible in emission spectra of 400 nm LED. The lowest absorption of ceramic disks was observed if 455 LED was used for excitation. This, however, is not surprising since in this spectral range only one absorption line (namely, 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>0</sub> → 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>2</sub>) of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions is present. Moreover, this line is very narrow and even though nearly all LED emission at around 465 nm is absorbed, the rest of LED emission passes through the disk unabsorbed. The relatively low absorption of 375 and 465 nm LED emission by prepared ceramic disks is, of course, a disadvantage for the practical application. However, on the positive side, the unabsorbed LED emission remains available for exiting phosphors emitting in other spectral regions.
