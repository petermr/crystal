<p>To prepare thin phosphor films with high optical quality, nanophosphors must feature a small nanoparticle size to avoid light scattering and high colloidal stability in polar solvents to prepare colloidal suspensions that are stable. In particular, nanophosphors employed in our investigation are synthesized following a solvothermal route and polyacrylic acid (PAA) as the functionalization agent, which not only has an important effect on the size and shape of the final nanocrystals but also increases the surface charge value that results in the stability of the suspension. The luminescent properties of nanophosphors arise from the interplay among a variety of factors ranging from composition to crystallinity or surface properties, and it is hard to foresee their efficiency prior to fabrication. We investigate nanophosphors based on NaGd(WO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, LaVO
 <sub>4</sub>, and GdVO
 <sub>4</sub> as inorganic hosts, as these matrices enable the excitation of the activator through an efficient energy transfer from the host to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, which results in brighter materials. In fact, the absorption bands of RE activators are generally associated to f–f transitions, being spectrally narrow and featuring low absorption cross sections. For this reason, aiming to improve the brightness of these materials, a wise choice of the inorganic host material enables the excitation of the activator through energy transfer from the host. However, such transfer bands lie in the ultraviolet B or ultraviolet C region of the spectrum, where commercial diodes are rather inefficient nowadays, despite the swift increase in the demand for efficient UV light sources for applications that go beyond lighting, such as printing, curing, or disinfection.

 </sup> Indeed, nanophosphor films are prepared by spin coating using alcoholic dispersions. Our method allows the fabrication of bright, transparent, and efficient thin films using a facile wet deposition route. Notice that compared with other coating techniques such as spray coating, sputtering, or screen printing, spin coating represents a simple and inexpensive alternative to prepare uniform layers of high optical quality with a film thickness that can be accurately controlled. Then, films are annealed at 800 °C—see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>e–h—to improve their emission properties, as both crystallinity and the crystallite size enlarge with temperature, yielding higher QY values.

 </sup> In general, the bond length and optical electronegativity of the ligand affect the crystal field strength significantly,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
 </sup> whereas the varying O–Gd–O or O–La–O bond angle alters the distortions of the GdO
 <sub>8</sub> or LaO
 <sub>8</sub> dodecahedron in the structure. Therefore, the choice of the host materials determines the crystal field strength and the lanthanide site, which have a great influence on the PL properties of Eu

 </xref>j gives the excitation and emission spectra of the nanophosphor films annealed at 800 °C for 4 h. The photoexcitation spectra monitored at the emission peak of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> are composed of a broad and intense band because of the charge transfer within the anions (WO

 <sup>2−</sup>, and VO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup>) of the matrices and from Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> to O
 <sup>2−</sup>, which indicates the existence of energy transfer from the hosts to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>. The typical emission profile of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions is observed when exciting at 300 nm. We can assign the different bands observed at ∼580, ∼615, ∼650, and ∼700 nm in the PL spectrum of the different nanophosphor films to the characteristic transition lines from the excited

 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>3</sub>, and 
 <sup>7</sup>F

 <sup>3+</sup>, respectively. As these transitions are associated to the activator, all fabricated Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor films display similar emission bands in the PL spectra. However, the differences in the symmetry of the lattice site occupied by the activator or the local crystal environment provided by the host give rise to the variations observed in the fine features of the emission spectrum.

 </sup> To evaluate the performance of the different films fabricated, we measure the QY of NaGd(WO

 <sup>3+</sup>, LaVO

 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor films, obtaining 10, 15, 25, and 75%, respectively. This group of nanophosphors allows the comparison of materials with the same crystalline structure but different composition, that is, NaGd(WO

 <sub>2</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, NaGd(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>:Eu

 <sup>3+</sup>, and similar chemical composition but different crystalline structure, that is, LaVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> and GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>. Although disparities in the QY values experimentally observed may originate from the different transfer efficiencies between the host and the activator or from the variations in the crystal structure, which affect the radiative rate of the activator, only rigorous calculations of the electronic structure of these materials could provide an ultimate answer for the physical origin of the differences found between the experimental efficiency values.
