 <caption> X-ray diffuse scattering. a Experimental and b calculated 3D constant-intensity surfaces for the X-ray diffuse-scattering intensity for a PbMg 1/3Nb 2/3O 3 single crystal at 300 K. The dark shade of blue marks the intersections of these surfaces with the bordering box. Note the distinct shape of the diffuse scattering at the h00-type and hk0-type locations. The 3D diffuse-intensity distribution was fitted simultaneously with the neutron and X-ray total scattering and extended X-ray absorption fine structure data, as summarized in Supplementary Fig.  1. The red arrows indicate the ½ ½ ½ -type peaks associated with the chemical ordering of Mg and Nb </caption>
