<p id="Par15">PEACl was synthesized by reacting equal molar of phenethylamine (Sigma) with hydrochloric acid solution (Alfa Aesar 37%) under nitrogen at ice bath for 2 h with stirring. After reaction, the white precipitate PEACl was recovered by rotary evaporation at 80 °C and recrystallized by diethyl ether for three times. The PEACl powders were finally collected and dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven for 24 h. CsPb, PbBr, and YCl
 <sub>3</sub> were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and TPBI was purchased from Lemtec. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> solution, PEACl solution, and YCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution with desired ratios. CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> solution (0.25 M) was prepared by mixing 106 mg CsBr and 183.5 mg PbBr
 <sub>2</sub> in 2 mL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> solution was filtered before using. PEACl solution (1 M) was prepared by mixing 158 mg PEACl in 1 mL DMSO. YCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution (0.25 M) was prepared by mixing 49 mg YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in 1 mL DMSO.
