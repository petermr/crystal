 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Around room temperature, the compound demonstrates extrinsic conduction, which is changed into activated behavior at lower temperatures, with activation energy of only about 8 meV. Below 50 K, crossover to hopping-type conduction was observed [
