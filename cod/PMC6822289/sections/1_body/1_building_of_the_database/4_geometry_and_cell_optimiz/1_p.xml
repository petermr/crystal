<p>In this database, 85% of the COFs are layered structures. To have consistent representation of all these layered COF structures, the unit cells were chosen to contain two layers for all COFs, and these layers were placed perpendicular to the 
 <italic>z</italic> axis (c dimension). The stacking of two-dimensional COFs is important for the evaluation of adsorption properties, and having only one layer would not allow the geometry to find its energy minimum in a possible AB stacking during the optimization. Out of 274 2D COFs, 253 single-layer structures were found and expanded assuming perfectly eclipsed stacking. We would like to emphasize that one also could opt for 3 or more layers, but this would make the optimization even more CPU-intensive.
