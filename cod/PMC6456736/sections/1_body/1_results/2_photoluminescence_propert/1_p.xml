 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 1–15%) at room temperature (RT), and the optimum Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration is determined to be 8 mol%. The diffuse reflectance spectra of NKLSO:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphors are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, and the absorption intensities increase gradually with increasing Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the diffuse reflectance, photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and PL spectra at RT of NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor. The PLE spectra monitored at two different wavelengths, 486 and 510 nm, show a broad band from 300 to 500 nm, indicating that the phosphor can be excited by ultraviolet light to blue light and is suitable for excitation of the commercial blue chip. The diffuse reflectance spectrum gives a broad absorption band in the range of 330–470 nm, which matched well with the PLE spectrum. The PL spectrum of the NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor consists of a dominant asymmetric narrow-band peak at 486 nm (FWHM = 20 nm) and a subordinate shoulder peak at 530 nm under 400 nm excitation, indicating that other luminescence centers may exist, which will be discussed later. In addition, we measured the PL spectra of NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> under different excitation wavelengths. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3a</xref>, compared to that of the dominant peak at 486 nm, the intensity of the minor peak at 530 nm increased obviously with increasing excitation wavelength, which further proves the existence of other luminescence centers and different evolution behaviors. We calculated the Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates and the color purity of the PL spectra of NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> under 400 nm and 460 nm excitation. The CIE chromaticity coordinates were calculated to be (0.1237, 0.4098) and (0.1430, 0.4380), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>), and the color purities were determined to be 68.7% and 66.8%. Under the excitation of 400 nm and 460 nm, the color coordinates of the phosphor moved slightly but still exhibited cyan emission, and the color purities remained almost unchanged. Moreover, the FWHM values of NKLSO:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> remained basically unchanged for different Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doping concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The inset image in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows that the sample has cyan light under 365 nm lamp irradiation. The highly condensed and rigid network results in the narrow-band emission and the small Stokes shift, which is determined as the energy difference between the maximum of the (lowest) excitation band and that of the emission band
 <sup>

 </sup>. The extremely small Stokes shift (1069 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) of NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> also accounts for the confinement in the local structure relaxation of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in its excited state. Under 400 nm excitation, the RT internal/external quantum efficiencies of NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> are determined to be 76%/30%, respectively, and the measurement details are shown in Supplementary Fig.
