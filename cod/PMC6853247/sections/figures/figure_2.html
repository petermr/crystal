 <caption> Two adjacent (with a small gap in between) orientation maps from the focus ion beam foil extracted from the location indicated on Figure  1. Spatial resolution: 10 nm. 550 × 350 data points. Precession angle 0.5°. The inverse pole figures represented here correspond to the vertical direction. They are superimposed with the reliability maps. Additional inverse pole figures (corresponding to the vertical and normal‐to‐plane directions), as well as the phase map, are provided in the supporting information. The color code is provided for the crystal orientations of the three phases. </caption>
