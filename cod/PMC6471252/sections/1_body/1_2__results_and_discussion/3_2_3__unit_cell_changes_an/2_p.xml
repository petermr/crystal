<p>Analysis of the principal strain axes, which can be performed using the PASCal server [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], allows quantifying the compressibility of a material and identifying the directions, which are the most important mechanically in the crystal structure. These may, or may not, coincide with crystallographic directions in the low-symmetry systems, but can be effectively linked to the most important intermolecular interactions. A summary of the strain tensor analysis for
