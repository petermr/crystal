 </sup>. Here we have engineered the amount of blue-emitting, green-emitting, yellow-emitting nanocrystals used in the fabrication of color-emitting thin films to achieve the different spectral power distributions with the goal of obtaining the white light with tunable CCT. For instance, for obtaining the warm white, we increased the yellow- and red-emitting NCs in comparison to the blue- and green-emitting NCs whereas for the cool white light, we increased the amount of blue- and green-emitting NCs in comparison to the other two NCs. The EL spectra of as-fabricated WLEDs are measured which are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>. No intermediate EL emission peak is detected, suggesting that the anion exchange reactions have been eliminated. Then, we have calculated the CCT, CRI, LER, and CIE coordinates based on the EL spectrum of individual WLEDs (shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The tunable CCT from warm to cold white (2218–8335 K) is achieved with high CRI (84–93) and LER (268–318 lm·W
 <sup>−1</sup>). The maximum CRI we obtained is 93 at a CCT of 2218 K and an LER of 286 lm·W
 <sup>−1</sup>. These CRI and LER are superior to the previous reports on WLEDs based on CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> NCs doped with other transition metal ions

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>. The inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> is the photographs of the as-fabricated WLEDs having different CCT at 8335 K, 6316 K, and 2510 K. The EL spectra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) demonstrates that a relatively high- the integrated intensity of the yellow and red phosphors is suitable for warm white light whereas increasing the integrated intensity of blue and green phosphors cool the light hue. The warm white creates a relaxing and cozy atmosphere whereas the neutral and cold white produces energizing and uplifting effects on human health. Besides, the comparable high CRI and LER are due to the smaller FWHM of the emission. The high CRI of light source indicates that the human eyes can recognize the natural color of the object under the light source and the high value of LER demonstrates the high vision performance which will lead to fabricating the highly energy-efficient LEDs. The CIE coordinates of the corresponding white light are close to the Planckian locus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), which suggests that the color temperature we obtained is pleasant for human eyes. In addition, one of the WLED (CCT of 5572 K) shows the CIE coordinates at (0.33, 0.36) is close to the CIE coordinates of standard neutral white light (0.33, 0.33). Thus, these remarkable optical properties of WLEDs based on Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-alloyed all-inorganic lead halide perovskites make them promising for light-emitting devices as a replacement for conventional phosphors.
