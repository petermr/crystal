<p>In conclusion, GdVO
 <sub>4</sub> was proved to be the best host for Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions over the NaGd(WO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, and LaVO
 <sub>4</sub> materials. We have also demonstrated a synthetic route to attain a transparent white-light-emitting coating based on a layered phosphor structure.
