<p>The important additional complication is that our workchain requires the interaction of multiple codes. Here, we show the advantage of employing a supervision tool that can automatically execute these codes. For this purpose we used the Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA),

 </sup> that allows the representation of our simulation protocol (the “workchain”) in a form of python script and its execution in an automated manner. It also gives a common language for different groups to collaborate in extending and improving the routines we designed.
