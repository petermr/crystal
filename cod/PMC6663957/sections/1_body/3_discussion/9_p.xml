<p id="Par65">RC values calculated for the image quality phantom show that the block model can better recover the intensity for the rods of 2 mm and 3 mm diameter. The block model decreases the partial volume effect and enhances the image contrast where the source size is close to the size of detector elements. For larger rods, the two models give similar results. The RC value for the smallest rod is not reliable due to the high %STD which is 90% and 140%, respectively, for the block and cylindrical model. The 1-mm rod is out of the resolution of the
