<p>In this manuscript, we aim to calculate the effect of magnetic noise –present in a single crystal of many equally-oriented copies of 
 <bold>1</bold> at a given concentration– to check whether it is the decoherence source limiting the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub> of a given set of pairs of energy levels in 
 <bold>1</bold>. An estimate yet rough was already provided in Jenkins et al. (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>); we will employ a state-of-the-art model recently developed by some of us (Escalera-Moreno et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). While previous models failed, ours succeeded at reproducing the experimental 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub> in challenging systems where magnetic noise is the limiting decoherence source (Shiddiq et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The particular set of pairs of energy levels is composed of those pairs whose transitions are resonant with the microwave frequencies employed in the so-called X-band of an EPR spectrometer, which range between ~9–10 GHz (Schweiger and Jeschke, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). We will compare our calculated values denoted as
