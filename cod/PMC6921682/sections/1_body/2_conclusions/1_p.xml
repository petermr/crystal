<p>The tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complexes with five-membered N-heteroaromatic ligands were synthesized and their spectroscopic and photophysical properties were characterized. All of the complexes in the present study showed high-emission quantum yield, except for (PPh

 <sub>4</sub>Him]. The bright yellow-green luminescence intensity change was accomplished by the solid-based reactions of the complexes involving changes in the coordination number and in the environment around the complex. The results demonstrated that the luminescence intensity change was controlled by the formation/dissociation of the weak bond in the solid state.
