<p id="Par23">To investigate the effect of calcination temperature on PL emission, the PL emission spectra of the samples at different calcination temperatures are tested and shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. As seen in the inset, the samples sintered at 600 °C and 800 °C only show the red emission peak centered at 617 nm which is attributed to the 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> → 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>2</sub> electric-dipole transition of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As the sintering temperature increases, the red emission peak becomes weak gradually and the green emission peak (centered at 523 nm) is obviously observed. Especially, the sample prepared at 1400 °C mainly shows a typical characteristic Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> emission centered at 523 nm, which is due to the 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d → 4f
 <sup>7</sup> transition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. By comparing the different PL curves in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, it can be observed that the amount of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> → Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> continuously increases with increasing sintered temperature. This result coincides with that of the XRD patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e. Namely, Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ion is the main form when the calcination temperature is lower than 1000 °C. Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are gradually reduced to Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions when the sintering temperature is higher than 1000 °C. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b shows the PLE and PL spectra of the sample sintered at 1400 °C. It can be found that the PLE spectrum shows a broad excitation band between about 310 and 450 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. And the inset is the photograph showing a bright green light emission with the illumination of a 365-nm UV lamp. The PL spectrum in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b is consistent with the color witnessed in the photograph.
