 <caption> Two main migration paths of O i and two types of equivalent O i (48 g and 96 h′) sites in the perfect crystal of the garnet-type Ca 3Fe 2Ge 3O 12. A part of the conventional cell of Fig.  1 is presented, showing all of the equivalent O i sites. The colors representing the cations are the same as those in Fig.  1. The 96 h′–O–96 h′ migration path with the kick-out mechanism is delocalized and connected to the neighboring cells in three-dimensional space. </caption>
