 <caption> The optical system for evaluating the effective source size and the effective divergent angle for forming IFRB between the beams in the BbB and B3bB modes. By tracing the beam in the BbB mode incident on the sample at x with the glancing angle back to the source, it arrives at point a in the plane of the source. In a similar way the beam in the B3bB modes arrives at point b. The length between the points a and b gives the effective source size for forming the IFRB at x. The effective divergent angle Δθ B is given by . </caption>
