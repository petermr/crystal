<p>Thermal expansion is the smallest in roughly [203] direction, i.e., in the direction in which the C–H⋯O H-bonds are present. According to estimates of intermolecular interaction energies, these directional interactions do not effectively withstand compression, but they seem to act as “clamps” in the case of intensifying molecular vibrations.</p>
