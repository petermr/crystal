<p>The paper selected linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as test materials. The LLDPE model was LLDPE7042 with a density of 0.922 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>. The LLDPE was produced by Jilin Petrochemical Company (Jilin, China). The model of LDPE was LD200BW with a density of 0.918 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>, and the model of MDPE was MDPE157 with a density of 0.935 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>. LDPE and MDPE were produced by Sinopec Beijing Yanshan Branch. The HDPE model was DMDA 8008 with a density of 0.954 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>. HDPE was produced by Daqing Petrochemical Company (Daqing, China).
