  <p>(a) PL spectra attained from a layered phosphor stack when the photoexcitation wavelength is gradually varied between 250 and 320 nm. All curves are normalized to the maximum intensity attained at 572 nm when the stack is illuminated at 265 nm. (b) PL spectrum of the stack illuminated at 275 nm (black) and 300 nm (gray). The gray curve has been vertically shifted for the sake of clarity. (c) Time-dependent PL of the 
   <sup>4</sup>F
   <sub>9/2</sub> and 
   <sup>5</sup>D
   <sub>0</sub> levels of Dy
   <sup>3+</sup> (green symbols) and Eu
   <sup>3+</sup> activators (red symbols) in the stack, respectively, together with their corresponding fits to the sum of two log-normal distributions of decay rates (black solid lines). Time dependence of the same transitions when the activators are deposited as isolated films is also shown as dark and light gray symbols, respectively. (d) PL QY vs the photoexcitation wavelength for a GdVO
   <sub>4</sub>:Dy
   <sup>3+</sup> layer (green symbols), a GdVO
   <sub>4</sub>:Eu
   <sup>3+</sup> layer (red symbols), and a GdVO
   <sub>4</sub>:Dy
   <sup>3+</sup>/GdVO
   <sub>4</sub>:Eu
   <sup>3+</sup> stack (black symbols).
