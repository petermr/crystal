 <sub>2</sub> is a competent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, albeit only capable of achieving a rather modest current density of −10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> at overpotentials of around 360 mV in sulfuric acid
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. This contrasts with the electrocatalytic activity displayed by the semiconducting 2H-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> polymorph, which was found to be largely catalytically inert. In our ongoing attempts to uncover the root cause of this difference in catalytic activity for the HER, we have now observed a remarkable and reversible 
 <italic>in operando</italic> electrochemical activation of the nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> material when it is held at cathodic potentials, which causes the overpotential required to sustain a current density of −10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> to decrease from 320 to 178 mV. Intriguingly, if the reductive potential is removed, then the enhanced activity is lost and the overpotential required to sustain 
 <italic>j</italic> = −10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> reverts back to its original value, and the electrode must be re-activated by poising at a cathodic potential. The whole process occurs without any irreversible morphology or composition changes, suggesting that a change in electronic structure (as the HER progresses) is the underlying cause of the enhanced performance. In this paper, we firstly describe the nature of this electrochemical activation, before proposing a mechanism by which the enhanced catalytic effect is achieved.
