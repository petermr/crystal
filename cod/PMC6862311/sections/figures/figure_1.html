 <caption> Schematic representation of the correlation function G ( r ) in real space and the structure factor S ( q ) in reciprocal space for one-dimensional systems with long-range order ( a, b) and short-range order ( c, d). Due to the exponential decay of the envelope of the correlation function in the case of short-range order ( c), only one broad Lorentzian-shape peak is visible in the structure factor ( d).
