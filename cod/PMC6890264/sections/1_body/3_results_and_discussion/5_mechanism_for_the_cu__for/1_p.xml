<p>Nanoscale CE reactions consist of a number of linked elementary kinetic steps:

 </sup> (i) extraction of the host cations from the NC surface, (ii) incorporation of guest cations at the NC surface, (iii) solid-state diffusion of the guest cations into the NC, and (iv) solid-state diffusion of the native cations to the NC surface. The thermodynamic driving force for the reaction is determined by the energy balance of the overall reaction.

 </sup> However, the energy input or output involved in each step is important as all steps are kinetically linked and must proceed in a concerted manner. Therefore, the outcome of nanoscale CE reactions (

 <italic>etc</italic>.) is dictated by the kinetic balance between a number of competing processes taking place in solution, at the NC surface and within the NC.
