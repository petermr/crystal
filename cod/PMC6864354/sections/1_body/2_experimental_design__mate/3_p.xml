<p id="p0050">The DFT optimization process are very sensitive to the input geometry, since difference in the energies of the different isomers are small. In some cases the “NumericalQuality good” and “ExactDensity” options in the input file led to the required isomer. An example input file, as well as the optimized coordinates as obtained by the different functionals, and a set of output files, are provided in the supplementary information.</p>
