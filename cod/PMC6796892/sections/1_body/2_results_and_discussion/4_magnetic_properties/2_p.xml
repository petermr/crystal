So, it can be said that this series of compounds possess not only giant magnetoelectric effect but also giant magnetovolume effect. It is to be noted that compounds with strong magnetovolume effect can be used to convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy or vice versa and are used to build actuators and sensors.
