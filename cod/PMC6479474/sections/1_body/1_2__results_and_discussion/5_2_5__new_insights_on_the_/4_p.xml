<p>Balabin et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] have concluded that, for the samples with high content of melamine, NIR spectroscopy yields better analytical performance than IR spectroscopy. It may be now confirmed that this occurs due to relatively much lower sensitivity of NIR bands to intermolecular interactions with the matrix molecules when compared to IR bands. The hydrogen-bonding influences the IR region of melamine much stronger than the NIR region, in which only minor band shifts and negligible intensity variations occur due to this effect. In such sense, this feature of pure melamine in crystal evidenced here (lower sensitivity of NIR bands than IR bands to the chemical environment of molecules of melamine), seems to also be universally preserved in complex samples consisting of various other molecules and biomolecules, e.g., in milk powder [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, analytical IR and NIR spectroscopy can evidence the structural and vibrational properties of melamine that were unveiled in our study to have a direct impact on the detection and quantification of melamine content.
