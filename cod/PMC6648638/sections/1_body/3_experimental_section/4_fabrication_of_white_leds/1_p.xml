<p>Red and green quantum dots were blended with an appropriate ratio and added to a mixture of oligomer, monomer, and photoinitiator. This mixture was stirred to obtain a uniform dispersion of QDs and dropped on the surface of a blue LED chip (emitting wavelength at 460 nm) which was then photopolymerized through irradiation for 90 s on 36 WLED-bulb UV light. When the switch of the QD-hybrid film covered blue chip was turned on, a white light-emitting LED was obtained and the PL spectrum and CIE-1931 coordinates were measured.</p>
