<p>Superstructures of nanoparticles, which preserve the unique properties of nanoparticles, and at the same time allow easy integration into devices due to their mesoscopic structure, have attracted increasing interest in the last decade [

 <xref rid="B91-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In this section, we will focus on the studies of a specific type of such superstructures, called mesocrystals, consisting of periodically arranged iso-oriented nanoparticles spatially separated by some media [
 <xref rid="B92-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Inorganic nanoparticles interlinked with organic π-systems are particularly promising materials for various applications, including field-effect transistors (FETs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodiodes, and photovoltaic cells (PVCs) [
