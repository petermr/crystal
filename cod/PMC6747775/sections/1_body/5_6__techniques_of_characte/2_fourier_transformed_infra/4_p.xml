<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02724-f031">Figure 31</xref>, we present a correlation between the stretching and bending Raman most intense peak versus the difference in electronegativities between Al and the metal of MAlH
 <sub>4</sub> (M = group 1). In general, there are less Raman data available than IR data. In both stretching and bending Raman modes, the correlation with the difference in electronegativity is not linear. The reported data were found only for Li, Na, and K-alanates. Thus, the Rb and Cs-alanates data are an extrapolation, pending future reports to corroborate this forecast.
