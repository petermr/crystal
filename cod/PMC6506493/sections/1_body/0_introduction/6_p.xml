<p id="Par8">In this work, we investigated the triplon band dispersion and its topological nature in the 2D quantum dimer compound Ba
 <sub>2</sub>CuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> using inelastic neutron scattering, as well as model analysis. The main finding of this study is the gap between two triplon bands, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As we discuss later, this result contradicts the previously reported crystal structure of 
 <italic>Cmce</italic>, which cannot host two triplon bands nor give rise to the gap between them. With the renewed space group 
 <italic>Cmc</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>, we show that the gap is indeed topologically protected, and hence hosts emergent edge states for the bond-alternation direction. This compound is the first realization of the bosonic analog of the 2D coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prototypical model for a one-dimensional topological insulator.
