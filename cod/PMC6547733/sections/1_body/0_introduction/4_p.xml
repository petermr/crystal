 </sup> investigating the effect of atomic collision processes, defect generation and phase transformation have been performed to understand the mechanisms leading to amorphization, the role of electronic excitation in amorphization has been investigated less. The simulation of electronic excitation effects is a challenging task, in which we must account for the dynamics of the electron-hole recombination

 </sup>. In order to mimic the effects of electronic excitation and ionization, a simplified methodology, consisting of removing several electrons from the higher valence band states, has been proposed and used in previous studies to investigate electronic excitations induced amorphization of Ge-Sb-Te alloys

 </sup>. It is worth noting that the effect of electronic excitation described by this method, and the resulting mechanisms leading to amorphization, are different from the intense electronic excitation induced by swift heavy ion irradiation, where local melting from the thermal spike leads to a quenched melt structure
