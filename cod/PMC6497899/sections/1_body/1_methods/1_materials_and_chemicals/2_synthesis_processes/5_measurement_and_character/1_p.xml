<p id="Par35">Fluorescence emission spectra were conducted on an Ocean Optics spectrometer. Absorbance spectra of samples were measured by using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. For Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> diffuse reflectance (R) spectra were measured by Ocean Optics spectrometer, and the Abs coefficient α was obtained by using the Kubelka–Munk theory (1 − 
 <italic>R</italic>) × (1 − 
 <italic>R</italic>)/2
 <italic>R</italic>. The excitation spectra and time-resolved PL spectroscopy (TRPL) have been measured by an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. The morphology of the QDs was acquired by a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit TWIN transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 100 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurement have been performed by Quanta 450 FEG. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskites were carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα: 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5406 Å). The absolute PL QYs of the samples were obtained by a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920P, Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with an integrating sphere with its inner face coated with BENFLEC. The brightness and efficiency have been measured by ATA-1000 electroluminescence measurement system (Everfine in People’s Republic of China).
