 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> presents the output power dependences of three different nonlinear diffraction orders on the input wavelengths. The input powers are set to be 0.8 W for all the measurements. One can obtain the respective QPM wavelengths from the peaks of the curves in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, which agree well with the theoretically calculated values of 819 nm, 801 nm, and 776 nm, respectively (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for calculations). A shorter fundamental wavelength is phase matched at a larger emit angle by involving a bigger transverse reciprocal vector. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, when the ±3rd-diffraction-order SH vortex beams are phase matched, one can still see weak lower-diffraction-order SH beams. This can be attributed to the bandwidth of the fundamental beam (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), which can tolerate certain phase mismatch. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows the dependences of output power on the pump power for different diffraction orders at their respective QPM wavelengths. The quadratic curves agree well with the theoretical relationship between the SH power and the fundamental power. When the input fundamental power is 1.2 W, the conversion efficiency reaches 2.8 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> for the 1st diffraction order, which is enhanced by one order of magnitude comparing to previous 2D nonlinear beam shaping experiments. The 2nd and 3rd diffraction orders carrying higher topological charges have conversion efficiencies of 2.7 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> and 0.44 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, respectively. The normalized conversion efficiencies are 1.4 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> W
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1.35 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> W
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 0.22 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> W
 <sup>−1</sup> for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd diffraction order, respectively (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> for calculations of the conversion efficiency). Such efficient SH vortex beam generations can profoundly enrich the applications of NPCs in spatial light beam manipulations and related fields
