 <p id="Par1">Non-destructive orientation mapping is an important characterization tool in materials science and geoscience for understanding and/or improving material properties based on their grain structure. Confocal Raman microscopy is a powerful non-destructive technique for chemical mapping of organic and inorganic materials. Here we demonstrate orientation mapping by means of Polarized Raman Microscopy (PRM). While the concept that PRM is sensitive to orientation changes is known, to our knowledge,Â an actual quantitative orientation mapping has never been presented before. Using a concept of ambiguity-free orientation determination analysis, we present fast and quantitative single-acquisition Raman-based orientation mapping by simultaneous registration of multiple Raman scattering spectra obtained at different polarizations. We demonstrate applications of this approach for two- and three-dimensional orientation mapping of a multigrain semiconductor, a pharmaceutical tablet formulation and a polycrystalline sapphire sample. This technique can potentially move traditional X-ray and electron diffraction type experiments into conventional optical laboratories.</p>
