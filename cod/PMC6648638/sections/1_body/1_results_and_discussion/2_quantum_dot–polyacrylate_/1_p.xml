 </xref> demonstrates the cross-sectional energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping of CdSe/ZnS (0.1 wt %) quantum dot–polymer hybrid light-emitting films. To identify the dispersibility of quantum dots in the polymer matrix, the cross-section of the QD–polymer hybrid light-emitting film was characterized by EDS. The elements of Zn, S, and Se are uniformly distributed in the polymer matrix, suggesting that the quantum dots are well-dispersed in the B2 polymer. But, the signal of Cd is less obvious, presumably because Cd has a higher bind energy.
