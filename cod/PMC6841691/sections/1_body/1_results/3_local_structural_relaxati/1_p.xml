<p id="Par10">The local structures of alloys are experimentally characterized usually by powder or single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The currently studied TaNbHfZr system has been experimentally studied in literature by various diffraction techniques to investigate into the average-structure lattice framework, atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) and diffuse scattering caused by any kind of SRO/ SRC type local structural disorder

 </sup>. Single crystal diffractions done on the annealed samples of TaNbHfZr showed streak-like diffuse scattering emerging from the Bragg reflection spots. The diffuse scattering streaks are oriented along the main &lt;1 0 0&gt; crystallographic directions, indicating presence of disorder perpendicular to these directions, discussed in details by Maiti

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. It can be found that in both the experimental and simulated reciprocal lattice layer, the streak-like diffuse scatterings are emerging out from the Bragg reflection spots along &lt;1 0 0&gt; directions and the streaks are asymmetric towards lower reciprocal lattice vector. By studying all the simulated results with the experimental validations, it can be observed that the nano-scale morphology of SRCs in TaNbHfZr HEA bcc average structure and its L-shaped streak-like diffuse intensity in reciprocal lattice layers are quite similar to that observed in Guinier-Preston (GP) Zone type local ordering
