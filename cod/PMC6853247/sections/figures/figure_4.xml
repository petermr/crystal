  <p>Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy maps of wadsleyite, olivine and the lamellae, located in the same region: (a) High angular annular dark field image of a zone which contains a grain of wadsleyite (on the left), olivine (on the right), and the lamellae (in the middle). Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy scanning transmission electron microscopy spectrum image of (b) oxygen, (c) silicon, (d) magnesium, (e) iron, and (f) nickel. The lamella is deficient in silicon (white arrow in c) relatively to both olivine and wadsleyite and enriched in iron and nickel relatively to olivine. It is rimmed by a silicon‐ and oxygen‐rich thin domain (indicated with a grey arrow in b and c). We can notice another thin lamella inside the olivine grain (thin white arrow in a), which width is below the resolution of the EDS analyzes.</p>
