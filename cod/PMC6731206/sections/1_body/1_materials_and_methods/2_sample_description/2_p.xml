<p id="p0040">The natural zeolite tuff used in the experiments was obtained from the Yagodninsky deposit of the Kamchatka region (Russia). This deposit is located 100 km from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Zeolite tuff is a massive rock of greenish-gray color. According to the data of the X-ray phase studies carried out at the RGC FEB RAS the main minerals are mordenite and clinoptilolite. Zeolite preparation was carried out in the following way: the sample was comminuted in a jaw crusher, a fraction measuring 0.25–0.5 mm was disengaged on sieves, washed with distilled water; the solid and liquid phases were separated by centrifuging or filtering and dried in the air at the room temperature. The average sample of the prepared zeolite was subjected to chemical and mineralogical analyses. The photo of natural zeolite of the Yagodnisky deposit of the Kamchatka region (Russia) is shown in the picture (
