<p>Red and green quantum dots are added with an appropriate ratio to the mixture of oligomer, monomer, and photoinitiator. The well-mixed dispersion was spin-coated on the surface of the blue LED chip and subjected to ultraviolet light irradiation to complete a white light LED device. In lighting the blue chip, the emitted blue light excited the mixed QDs to emit green and red lights, whereas the blue light, green light, and red light are mixed together to obtain white light emitting LED (as shown in

 </xref> also shows the PL spectra and the CIE-1931 coordinate of the white LED. PL spectra exhibit blue, green, and red peaks corresponding to the blue chip, green QD, and red QD emission, respectively. The above three primary colors are mixed to obtain white light located at CIE-1931 coordinate of 0.3339 and 0.3192 in the present study.
