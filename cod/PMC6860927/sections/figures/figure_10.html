 <caption> TAPSim-based detector hit map: The lines detected (shown in white) are quasi-linear local ion density fluctuations which the Hough transform picks up. These are affected by the geometry, e.g. the thickness of the boundary, the atomic structure of the adjoining crystals, and known TAPSim field evaporation artifacts [ 11]. </caption>
