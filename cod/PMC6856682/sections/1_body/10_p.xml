<p>Thus, the 
 <sup>31</sup>P{
 <sup>1</sup>H} resonance at 116.0 ppm can be assigned to the new compound 
 <bold>3‐π</bold>, in which an intact CO
 <sub>2</sub> moiety has attached to the phosphinine carbon “
 <italic>ipso</italic>” to the pyridyl group.
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> The resulting carboxylate‐substituted phosphacyclohexadienyl ligand coordinates to Fe in an η
 <sup>5</sup> fashion, and the carboxylate itself interacts in a κ
 <sup>2</sup> manner with the potassium countercation. It is noteworthy that no reaction is observed between CO
 <sub>2</sub> and the free ligand 
 <bold>L</bold> under analogous conditions.
