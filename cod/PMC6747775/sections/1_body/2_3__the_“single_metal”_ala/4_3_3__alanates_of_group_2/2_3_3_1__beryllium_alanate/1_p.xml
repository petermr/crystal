<p>The existence of Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is questionable. Some reviews list the Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> phase with a dehydrogenation temperature of 20 °C [
 <xref rid="B186-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. The cited reference of these reviews is a book of relatively difficult access [
 <xref rid="B187-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>], whih in turn refers to a series of published works on borohydrides and other boron compounds [
 <xref rid="B188-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>,
 <xref rid="B189-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. However, these references dealt with the synthesis of Be(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, not Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B188-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>,
 <xref rid="B189-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. In 1973, Ashby et al. attempted to produce Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> from LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, or NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, and BeCl
 <sub>2</sub> in diethyl ether and THF without success [
 <xref rid="B190-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. In favor of the existence of Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is the report of Wiberg et al. (1951) [
 <xref rid="B191-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. In this work, the reaction between BeCl
 <sub>2</sub> and LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> was proposed to produce Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> in ether at 20 °C. However, no further details were presented.
