<p>The scaled wind tunnel was designed with a reservoir to accumulate a 10 cm high amount of sand to cover its base. Taking into account the dimensions of this base (244 cm Ã— 52cm) and the average density of the beach sand used (1600 kg/m
 <sup>3</sup>), a total amount of 200 kg of sand was needed to fill the reservoir.
