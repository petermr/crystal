<p id="Par35">Nano-indentation was performed on a MTS NanoXp, with a spherical diamond tip (~4.2 μm radius, 90° cone angle, from Synton MDP) to a maximum displacement of 500 nm with 50 µm spacing between indents. Indent impressions were imaged using a Zeiss Merlin FEG SEM. Surface morphology was determined using a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 AFM in contact mode using Bruker CONTV-A tips (nominal tip radius 10 nm).</p>
