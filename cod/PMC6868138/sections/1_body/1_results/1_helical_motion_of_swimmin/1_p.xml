<p id="Par8">Overcrowded alkenes were used as light-driven molecular rotary motors (Me-
 <bold>m</bold> and Ph
 <bold>-m</bold>, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The asymmetric structure of the motors is transmitted to liquid crystals and small concentrations of motor can thus transform an achiral (nematic) liquid crystal into a chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid crystal that is characterized by a helical organization of the molecules. Molecular motors are unique photo-responsive dopants for liquid crystals because their light-driven operation involves inversion of their helical chirality and thus induces a large-scale, precise, and reversible winding or unwinding of cholesteric helices
