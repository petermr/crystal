<p id="Par17">In summary, the structural analyses provided additional support that two types of solids were obtained during the annealing process as previously differentiated by their thermodynamics. There is no experimental evidence that the eutectic NaK solidifies only as a crystal. Here, we have predicted that a metastable amorphous solid state is also reachable below 140 K along an annealing process. The lower enthalpy branch ranging from 50–230 K pertained to a crystalline matrix of potassium atoms spanning the computational box and encasing an extended cluster of sodium atoms. Meanwhile, the inflection point in the supercooled liquid-amorphous branch around 140 K suggested that below that temperature the system had transitioned to a solid, amorphous state. The transition resembled a glass transition. However, the amorphous solid did not display a homogeneous distribution of Na atoms in the K amorphous matrix as expected in a glass. Instead, an amorphous matrix of K atoms encased several small clusters of Na atoms that were themselves also amorphous. Therefore, we associated the inflection point with a temperature at which the supercooled liquid was viscous enough to transform definitely into a solid with amorphous structure but not necessarily a glass. Such temperature depends on the cooling rate
