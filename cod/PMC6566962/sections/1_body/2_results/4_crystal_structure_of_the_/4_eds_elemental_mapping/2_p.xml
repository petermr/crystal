 <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(a</xref>) shows an HAADF-STEM image of the η″ phase in the Al-31.0 at.%Fe alloy taken along the [001]
 <italic>
  <sub>Cmcm</sub>
 </italic> direction. In the projection along this direction, atomic columns forming the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain can clearly be observed without disturbance by other atoms, as seen in the schematic crystal structure of 
 <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(b</xref>). In addition to bright spots corresponding to Fe atoms (red circles) and Al atoms (blue circles) in the FeAl
 <sub>2</sub> framework structure, those corresponding to the atomic columns of the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain (green circle) are clearly seen with the brightness between those of Fe and Al atoms in the FeAl
 <sub>2</sub> framework structure. An Fe-elemental map obtained using atomic-resolution EDS is shown in 
 <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(c</xref>). Areas enriched with Fe are located at the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites, in addition to those at Fe atoms in the FeAl
 <sub>2</sub> framework structure. This is a clear indication that the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites in the η″ phase are indeed occupied by not only Al but also Fe atoms.
