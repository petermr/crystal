 </sup>. At first, the analysis shows that there is one complete TL and approximately one half of a second TL on the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub> surface. Thus, in comparison with the STM experiments which indicated a single TL only, this sample is covered by BiI
 <sub>3</sub> at its saturation coverage at 300 K. It can be concluded that the interlayer interaction is very weak which is also corroborated by the fact that desorption of the whole film sets in at about 360 K as evidenced by the rapid loss of the BiI
 <sub>3</sub> reflection intensities. Correspondingly, the vertical spacing between the first and the half filled second TL is considerably enlarged as compared to the bulk. For instance, the closest interlayer I–I distance
