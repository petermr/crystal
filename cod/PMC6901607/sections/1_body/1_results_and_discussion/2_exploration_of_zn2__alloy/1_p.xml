<p id="Par10">The study of the effect of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> incorporation on the iodide-based perovskite NCs is carried out. XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) indicate that the samples prepared and stored in an ambient atmosphere decomposed significantly after some hours, similar to the study reported earlier

 </sup>. This is ascribed to the degradation of the NCs from the black phase to the non-emissive yellow phase. However, the fresh samples prepared without and with the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> show tunable PL emission (672–646 nm) with the FWHM in the range of 50–54 nm, Supplementary Fig.
