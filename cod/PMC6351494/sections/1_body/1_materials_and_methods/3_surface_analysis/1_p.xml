<p>In order to characterize the passivation layer at the surface of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film electrode, we conducted X-ray photo electron spectroscopy: XPS (ESCA3400, Shimadzu) with Mg-KÎ± radiation. As a comparison, the XPS spectra for a magnesium metal thin film was also measured. The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the magnesium metal thin films were immersed in the BuMeG3 solution for 24 h, right after the sputtering process. Subsequently the thin films were rinsed with monoglyme(G1) to remove the BuMeG3 solutions. The emission current and the acceleration voltatge of the X-ray gun is 20 mA and 10 kV respectively. Argon ion etching, with 20 mA of emission current and 2 kV of acceleration voltage, was carried out to take the depth profile.
