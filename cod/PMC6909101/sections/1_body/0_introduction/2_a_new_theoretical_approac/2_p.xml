<p id="p0010">Quantum mechanics is one of the main, if not the most important, branches of modern theoretical physics. In the 20th century, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and solid state physics based on quantum mechanics created a fundamental basis for recent and modern technological progress. Therefore, even in a broad scientific environment, the possibilities of quantum mechanics are considered to be almost limitless. The applicability of quantum mechanics extends, for example, to the entire universe (see Refs. [

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) and even the human brain and associated consciousness (see Refs. [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). The word “quantum” is very fashionable in modern science (see Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). In short, in the broad scientific community, there is a very popular view that quantum mechanics is the last and ultimate word about the essence of nature (see Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). The current paper discusses the limits of the applicability of quantum mechanics based on an analysis of the internal contradictions that arise when it is applied unbiased to a wide range of problems in molecular and chemical physics.
