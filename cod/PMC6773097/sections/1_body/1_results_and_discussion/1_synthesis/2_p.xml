<p>For the zeolite synthesis, we used a set of inorganic component ratios consistent with earlier work on high silica zeolites like ZSM‐5 (
 <bold>MFI</bold>), where a reduced hydroxide to silica ratio was needed to create structures rich in 5‐ring sub‐units. An important finding proved to be the need to reduce the alkali content while retaining the amount of hydroxide, and this was achieved by replacing the alkali cations with the quaternary ammonium centres. This change reduces the intrusion of high‐silica zeolite competitors such as Mordenite and Magadiite, which require sodium in the synthesis.

 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A comparison of the X‐ray powder diffraction patterns for SSZ‐26 and SSZ‐27 is shown in Figure
