<p id="Par3">Many materials are polycrystalline, meaning that they are composed of a large number of grains (crystallites) of different crystallographic orientations. A full three-dimensional (3D) orientation mapping of the grains (with information about the position, size, morphology, and orientation of each grain, as well as the topological connectivity between the grains) is crucial to relate structure to properties.</p>
