<p>We also investigate the variation of the color rendering index (CRI), color temperature (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>), and light extraction efficiency of the white LEDs operated at different current densities. In 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>a, the value of the CRI increases with the increase in the operating current density, because the increased operating current density results in an increase of the emission band width which eventually leads to an increase in the CRI value.

 </xref>c shows the light extraction efficiency of the sample operating at different current densities, revealing that the efficiency reaches a maximum of 14% at a current density of 30 mA, whereas the overall value falls on average around 10–12%. This value is similar to other matrix materials (
