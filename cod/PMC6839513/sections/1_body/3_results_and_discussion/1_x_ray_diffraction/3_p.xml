<p>Comparison of the Bragg peak positions with the already known structure of 
 <bold>form I</bold> can be made but does not explain the measured peaks in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>. For instance, a strong peak is located at about 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>p</sub> = 5 and 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> = 13 nm
 <sup>–1</sup>. Various peaks at constant 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>p</sub> = 10 nm
 <sup>–1</sup> or 14 nm
 <sup>–1</sup> are found at different 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub>. As these spots are well-defined and not smeared, one can conclude that the mosaicity of the crystals is small. This fact is explained likely on account of the crystals growing in proximity to the substrate surface, i.e., where a two-dimensional confinement is taking place. The absence of rings or multiple peaks along a Debye ring also shows that all these surface-induced crystals contact the surface with the same 200
 <sub>SIP</sub> net plane. The sample itself is polycrystalline with the individual crystals having azimuthal random arrangements which makes this structure a fiber textured one. In case of a single crystal or uniaxially alignment, the number of peaks would be low or even zero for an arbitrary measurement direction. The amount of diffraction information for the phenytoin sample here is only complete if the sample is rotated during measurement, thus collecting all information from such a two-dimensional powder. In a recent report,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 </sup> many spots were missing due to the lack of proper rotation possibilities, which resulted in an incomplete information. Consequently, the previously determined unit cell was of low quality and cannot explain all peaks from the complete pattern shown here.
