  <p>A sketch of the technique developed for the deposition of ordered QR arrays on organic layers. a) A toluene solution of QR is first spread on water. b) After the solvent evaporation, the floating film is finished by means of a PDMS stamp pad or a carbon coated TEM grid; the zoom displays a TEM image of a self‐assembled QR film on the latter substrate. QRs are arranged in ribbon‐like structures in which they are joined side‐by‐side along their elongated 
   <italic>c</italic>‐axis, thereby resembling the smectic phase of a liquid crystal. c) The inked PDMS is brought into conformal contact with the organic layer by applying a gentle pressure. d) Finally, the stamp is removed, and the QR film is successfully transferred onto the organic surface. The zoom shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of such laterally aligned QR film. Some of QRs are highlighted in orange as a guide to the eye.
