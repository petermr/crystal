 <caption> Results obtained from the full workflow are sketched for three COFs: 18041N3, 13180N3, and 05001N2. From the left to the right we can find the initial geometry, the energy profile during the three-stage optimization, the final geometry and its main geometric properties, the CO 2 and N 2 isotherms and heat of adsorption, and finally the results from the process modeling. “SA”, “PV”, and “LFS” labels indicate, respectively, the nitrogen-accessible surface area, pore volume, and the largest free sphere’s diameter. “PE” and “WC” stand for the minimal parasitic energy and the CO 2 working capacity in the adsorbent, respectively. </caption>
