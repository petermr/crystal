<p>In this study, we document the formation of Anh‐B (and stishovite) in San Carlos olivine at 
 <italic>P</italic>=14 GPa and 
 <italic>T</italic>=1400 °C. At these conditions, the stable phase would be wadsleyite, and indeed, we do see the formation of wadsleyite. In contrast to wadsleyite that occur both on grain‐boundaries and inside of grains with little topotactic relationships to the host (olivine), Anh‐B crystals show strong topotactic relationships to parent olivine grains. This suggests that in olivine, Anh‐B (and stishovite) can form due to kinetic reasons (lower nucleation energy barrier) as a meta‐stable phase.
