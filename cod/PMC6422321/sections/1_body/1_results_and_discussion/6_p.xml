<p>The particular photochromic effect displayed herein offers a unique and unprecedented way to control the shade of the emission color attained from a phosphor coating. In this regard, the potential of these transparent stacks is analyzed by studying the PL of the GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> stack in comparison with a 500 nm film in which GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor nanoparticles were mixed together at two different ratios. A gradual shift of the excitation energy allows attaining different chromaticity values comprised between the one of GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and GdVO

 <sup>3+</sup>—open symbols in

 </xref>a. As it can be seen in the CIE 1931 color space plotted in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a, a variety of shades contained in the achromatic region are achieved. In particular, the photoexcitation of the GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> stack at λ
 <sub>ex</sub> = 300 nm yields a warm white light, meeting the Planckian locus at 2600 K. Similarly, when the order of the layers in the stack is reversed, that is, GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>/GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>, the color of the emission can be also controlled with the photoexcitation wavelength, as shown with red symbols in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a. In contrast, when the GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor nanoparticles are mixed together in a film, the chromaticity of the emission is only determined by the ratio of each material in the mix, for example, 85% of GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> or 60% of GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> nanophosphors, and the color coordinates of the homogeneous mixture are independent of the photoexcitation wavelength, as shown by dark and gray symbols in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a, which highlights the importance of the phosphor layering to tune the emission color of a given film. Notice that we did not consider preparing films of codoped GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> nanophosphors to avoid processes related to cross-relaxation and energy transfer between the energy levels of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, which generally deteriorate the yield of the individual activators. Finally, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b–e displays the digital pictures of the light emitted by the coatings, which highlight the precision in determining the coating response that can be achieved by combining the adequate bilayer configuration and excitation wavelength. We have demonstrated that both routes (mixing and layering) allow tuning the emission color of a combination of phosphors. Indeed, our measurements confirm that chromaticity coordinates can be accurately controlled by engineering the relative ratio between the Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> nanoparticles in the mixture. However, different emission colors require the preparation of different coatings. In contrast, the layering approach offers the possibility to tune the chromaticity of the emission of a given coating by changing the photoexcitation wavelength, which represents its main benefit.
