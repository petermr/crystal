<p id="Par26">In this work, we have introduced a general method that can be used to predict metal-ligand interface structures of ligand-protected metal nanoparticles. The method uses the information from the local bonding environments of known reference structures (in our case the reference structures comprise reported crystal structures of similar thiolate- and phosphine-protected gold and silver nanoclusters) and can be easily generalized for the structural prediction of any nanostructure, in case enough reference information is available. The main variables, nearest neighbour bonds and bond angles between the interface atoms, are generally valid to be used for any atom type in any nanostructure. The steric parameters used in this paper can straightforwardly be generated to any atom types and molecular groups at the metal-ligand interface. Our algorithm is written in a modular way in order to maximize the flexibility and transferability to other metal-ligand systems, such as gold-alkynyls etc. An interesting test case would be provided by predictions of gold-thiolate interfacial structures in planar, self-assembling thiol monolayers on Au(111), which has been under intense investigations since 1980â€™s
