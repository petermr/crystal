 <sub>4</sub> confined in mesoporous carbon scaffolds (up to 8.5 wt.% content, rehydrogenation at 500 Â°C, 100 bar, 10 h, seven cycles). Confinement in meso or nanoporous materials is another strategy for reducing the dehydrogenation temperature and improving the reversibility. However, a reduction in the hydrogen capacity is expected. Other confinement effects are [

 <xref rid="B107-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]: (i) The reduction or total elimination of the loss of critical elements, such as B in the borohydrides. (ii) Reduction of the diffusion pathways of several species. (iii) Interaction with the meso or nanomaterials supports (can be of catalytic type). (iv) Large surface areas. (v) Reduction of the activation energies. The confinement as a strategy for improving hydrogen storage properties depends on several factors, such as: (i) the material used for confinement (carbons, nanocarbons, zeolites, graphene, silica, etc.) (ii) The history of the confined material. (iii) The way of infiltration (and drying if necessary). (iv) The size of the porous. (v) Functionalization of the surface of the support material. Confinement is a universe of possibilities, and it deserves a mayor review that is beyond the scope of the present report on alanates.
