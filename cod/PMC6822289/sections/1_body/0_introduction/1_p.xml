<p>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of emerging materials composed of covalently bonded organic residues.

 </sup> While classical covalent crystals like diamond, graphene, or carbon nitride could also be considered as COFs, this nomenclature highlights the concept of reticular design, where the precursor molecules, termed 
 <italic>ligands</italic> or 
 <italic>linkers</italic>, are rationally combined into a framework structure. The ancestors of COFs are metal organic frameworks (MOFs), where ligands form coordinate bonds with metal centers. In COFs, however, ligands are directly connected, forming the topology of the structure.
