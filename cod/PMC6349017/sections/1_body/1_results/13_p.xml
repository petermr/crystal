<p>At ZnO(112[combining macron]0), O*H
 <sup>–</sup> in the intra-surface-PT coordinate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>) can move towards the nearest Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> in the neighboring surface row, ending up in a configuration where the O*H
 <sup>–</sup> bridges two surface rows (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Although such bridging species accept a hydrogen bond from O
 <sub>s</sub>H
 <sup>–</sup>, they are mostly inactive for PT, as the PT reaction from a bridging O*H
 <sub>2</sub> is barrierless (ESI Fig. 4
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Bridging O*H
 <sup>–</sup> thus disappear by moving back along [0001] to the intra-surface-PT configuration. About 12% of O*H
 <sup>–</sup> at ZnO(112[combining macron]0) are in such a bridging configuration. In the coming analysis, we assign the location of the PHC for such bridging configurations to be the location of the O*H
 <sup>–</sup>.
