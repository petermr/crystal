<p id="Par16">As evident from the CVGs, the 1B-Y LED PKG exhibit a decrease in all the 16 hue bins, whereas the 1B-GR and 1B-BYR LED PKGs to exhibit much lesser shifts from those of the reference illuminant. The Chroma shifts indicate the relative percentage (positive/negative) shifts of the 16 hue-angle bins. The CVG of 1B-Y LED show that the light source fabricated using 1B-Y LED will result in less saturated images. As expected, the 1B-Y LED PKG exhibit a significant shift in the local Chroma values. For 1B-Y LED PKG, most of the Chroma values show a negative shift, and the change up to âˆ’17% is observed.</p>
