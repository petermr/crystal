<p>After applying the piezoelectric transducer QB220-503YB at the proposed area at each of the selected three stations and calculating the converted electric energy using the equivalent L
 <sub>DEN</sub> at each station as a proposed trial to find if this conversion process is beneficial or not is presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.t014" ref-type="table">14</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.t015" ref-type="table">15</xref> using the equations 2, 3, 4, and 5. As the three stations have equivalent L
 <sub>DEN</sub> more than 80 dB, the data of the material when exposed to 80 dB will be considered and used in the calculations.
