<p>To assess the effects of hydroxyl groups without changing the oxidation state of Sn as determined from the XPS data, we added water molecules to the stoichiometric Sn
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>17</sub> formula one by one while simulating the resulting Raman spectra (fig. S8, A to E). Structure optimization simulations demonstrated that all hydroxyl groups protruded outward from the surface of the model SNC structures, sporadically forming hydrogen bonds with neighboring atoms in Sn─O─Sn configurations (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and fig. S8, F to I). As the water content was increased from Sn
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>17</sub> to Sn
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>25</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>, the peak position of the main broad Raman band gradually shifted to the lower wave number region from 634 to 571 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (fig. S8J). Among these simulated Raman spectra, the Sn
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>25</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub> spectrum showed a maximum at 571 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, dashed line), and the spectral shape was surprisingly similar to that of the experimental spectrum acquired from the Sn
 <sub>12</sub> oxide SNCs (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, solid line). Similar simulation processes were implemented for Sn
 <sub>28</sub> and Sn
 <sub>60</sub> SNCs, and both Sn
 <sub>28</sub>O
 <sub>48</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub> and Sn
 <sub>60</sub>O
 <sub>112</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub> were found to produce broad bands at similar frequencies to those observed in the corresponding SHINER spectra (fig. S9). The broad bands in the SHINER spectra were also blue-shifted by 10 to 30 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> when Sn oxide SNCs were calcined at 300°C (fig. S9), suggesting that water was removed, leading to a partial decrease in surface hydroxyl groups. As a consequence, the broad band was shifted to a higher wave number region, as predicted by the theoretical vibration analyses with different amounts of H
 <sub>2</sub>O addition. The variations in the main peak position upon calcination therefore provide evidence for the presence of hydroxyl group in the SNCs.
