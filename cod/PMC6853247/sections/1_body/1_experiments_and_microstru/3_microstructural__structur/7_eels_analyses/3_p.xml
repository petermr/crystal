<p>EELS analyses have been performed with a Thermo FischerÂ® Titan Themis TEM, operating at 80 kV to reduce electron beam damage. ELNES structures are analyzed with a monochromated STEM spectrum image mode, with an energy resolution of approximately 0.3 eV. In order to detect the ELNES details, the spectrometer energy dispersion was chosen to be 0.025 eV/channel.</p>
