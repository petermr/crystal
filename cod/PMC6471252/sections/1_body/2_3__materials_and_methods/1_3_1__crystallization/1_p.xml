 </inline-formula> were obtained by slow diffusion of n-pentane into the saturated chloroform solution of the compound. The crystals were large yellow oblong prisms or thick plates with well-formed faces. A single specimen was used for the structure re-determination at room temperature and the multi-temperature diffraction study.
