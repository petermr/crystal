<p content-type="flushleft">To verify the first hypothesis that quinoline drugs cap hemozoin crystals, we colocalize the iron (Fe) signal of hemozoin crystals with the bromine (Br) signal of BrQ. In order to assess the efficiency of hemozoin growth inhibition by capping with BrQ we measure the BrQ coverage on the surface of hemozoin crystals.</p>
