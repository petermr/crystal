<p id="Par14">In order to gain a better understanding of the effect of the crystal structure and Ag vacancy engineering on the transport properties, we have measured the Hall coefficients (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>) at RT for non-heat treated samples, and then calculated the Hall carrier concentrations (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>) and mobility (
 <italic>μ</italic>). The results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, in which the 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> value generally decreases from 5.19 × 10
 <sup>16</sup> cm
 <sup>−3</sup> to 6.9 × 10
 <sup>14</sup> cm
 <sup>−3</sup> as the 
 <italic>x</italic> value (or V
 <sub>Ag</sub>) increases, and that the 
 <italic>μ</italic> value increases from 5.83 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/Vs to 636.7 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/Vs. This indicates that Ag cation vacancy has a negative effect on the carrier concentration. Such an effect, which has been reported in many materials, such as Cu-Ga(In)-Te ternary compounds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>, can be elucidated by unpinning the Fermi level (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>f</sub>) followed by its movement towards the conduction band (CB)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. As a consequence, the p-type holes is neutralized and the carrier concentration is thus reduced. Although the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> values might be affected by the presence of the Te and/or AgTe
 <sub>3</sub>, it is believed that the impact should be minimum, due to the limited contents of the impurities. Plus, the 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> value is rather low compared to the reported counterparts CuInTe
 <sub>2</sub> (&gt;1.87 × 10
 <sup>18</sup> cm
 <sup>−3</sup>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup> and CuGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> (1.1 × 10
 <sup>18</sup> cm
 <sup>−3</sup>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup> but is comparable to that of AgGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> (1.13 × 10
 <sup>16</sup> cm
 <sup>−3</sup>)
 <sup>5</sup>. However, the mobility 
 <italic>μ</italic> value (87.0 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/Vs) of AgGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> at RT is much higher than that of AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub>, which implies that AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> has a much larger electrical resistivity than AgGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> (~1.0 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> mΩ cm at RT)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, even though the bandgap of AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> = 1.04 eV)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup> is less than that of AgGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> = ~1.2 eV)
 <sup>
