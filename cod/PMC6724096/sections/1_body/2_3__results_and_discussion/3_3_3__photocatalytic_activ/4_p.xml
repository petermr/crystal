<p>The result of UV-vis DRS has shown a photoresponse under visible light. In order to explore the degradation ability of the catalyst under visible light, an Xe lamp (300 W, 25.89 mW/cm
 <sup>2</sup>), the light of which was below 400 nm, eliminated by an ultraviolet cut-off filter, was used as a visible light source. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f010">Figure 10</xref>d shows the degradation ability of P25, pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and two Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. P25 and pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> showed no degradation ability under visible light; the minimal decrease of toluene was caused by adsorption. On the contrary, both 1.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and 5.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> showed degradation ability under visible light. However, the photocatalytic efficiency decreased from 95.7% and 74.1% under UV light to 54.9% and 47.7%, respectively. The possible reason for this is that the addition of iron leads to the absorption of visible light by TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. However, because the energy of visible light is lower than that of UV light, only part of the light was used, and so the photodegradation efficiency is lower than that under UV light.
