<p>One approach to targeted placement at a specific site is to incorporate the bioactive compound into a solid matrix (for example, a biocompatible polymer) that can be used as an implant.

 </sup> Implants are already used for timed drug release,

 </sup> Such a device could be attached to an optical fiber that would transmit light to the target site to uncage the desired bioactive molecule. Alternatively, if the device were responsive to NIR excitation, then the use of the fiber and associated hardware may be unnecessary.
