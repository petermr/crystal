<p id="Par14">According to these simulations, the ambiguity can be successfully resolved when off-axis channels are added to the measurement setup. Still, adding only two off-axis channels is not sufficient to resolve ambiguity completely. Full resolution becomes possible when adding three off-axis channels to six on-axis channels, resulting in total nine measurement channels. Further addition of up to in total 12 channels does not noticeably increase the accuracy of the fit. Thus, in our experimental setup we decided to use nine channels.</p>
