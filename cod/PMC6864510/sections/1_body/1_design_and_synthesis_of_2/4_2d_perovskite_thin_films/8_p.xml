<p>A profound understanding of the growth mechanism is important for regulating the orientation of materials through precursors. Since a perfect band alignment naturally exists in the materials, this special structure can facilitate electron and hole transfer, which may further promote efficient emission and photovoltaic performance.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> The spin‐coating method is characterized by simple operation, low cost, and easy to form large area, but it is not easy to select the appropriate solvent that not only dissolves hybrid perovskite crystal precursors, but also has good wettability to the substrate. Molecular orientation degree and carrier mobility of the as‐prepared films are not high, and the thickness, uniformity, and surface morphology of the films are difficult to control, limiting the application range of the spin‐coating method.
