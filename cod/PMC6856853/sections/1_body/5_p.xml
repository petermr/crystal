<p>The methanolysis of 
 <bold>1</bold> in diethylether at low temperatures results in the formation of yellow crystals of 
 <bold>2</bold> in a very low yield, which are surrounded by a large amount of unidentified brown solid (Scheme 
 <xref rid="anie201909423-fig-5002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). If the reaction is performed at −80 °C and all volatiles are removed in vacuum at a maximum temperature of −50 °C, and while warming up to room temperature, the residue is sublimated into a cooled Schlenk tube (−80 °C) as a yellow solid of [{Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub>}{η

 <sub>2</sub>H

 <bold>2</bold>) obtained in 86 % yield.

 <bold>2</bold> is extremely air‐ and moisture‐sensitive and decomposes rapidly at temperatures above −20 °C. Interestingly, under similar reaction conditions, the methanolysis of [{Fe(CO)

 <sub>4</sub>}(PH

 <bold>2</bold> and other unidentified products.
