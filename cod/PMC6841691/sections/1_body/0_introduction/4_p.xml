<p id="Par5">In literature, an EAM potential for TaNbHfZr HEA was developed and using this, local structural relaxation at the modeled SRCs, changes in local enthalpy and its relation to the extra mechanical strengthening was studied Maiti

 </sup>. But in that case a presumed model simulation system was initially manually constructed based on the information about SRCs obtained from detailed high-end experimental characterizations and interpretations from HRTEM and APT. There is a lack of literature in the fields of HEAs or CCAs where the local lattice structure was evolved by independent computer simulation with no experimental input; structural relaxation, SRO/ SRC and thermodynamic properties determined to explain the real behaviour of the alloy under certain heat-treatment processing conditions etc. In this work, we have computationally studied equimolar TaNbHfZr HEA for its nanostructure morphology evolution for high-temperature annealing, evolution of SRO/SRC, local lattice relaxations, which closely validates these structural characteristics obtained from the abovementioned high-end experimentations like HRTEM, APT and synchrotron XRD

 </sup>. In this work the TaNbHfZr system had 11664 atoms with 18 × 18 × 18 bcc supercell structure, which including its periodic neighbours can span a cubic length of around 19 nm, and was found to be sufficient for the simulation of nanostructure and SRC evolution with high-temperature annealing treatment at 1800 °C. MC/MD technique with EAM type MD potentials were utilized in this work.
