<p id="Par9">Morphology of the sample were taken using Zeiss Merlin Compact scanning electron microscope (SEM) with own an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). TEM were verified by a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu-Kα irradiation (10°–90°, a scan rate of 0.1° s
 <sup>−1</sup> (2θ)). FTIR spectrums of the sample were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipment (NicoletiS50, Thermo fisher scientific). The chemical feature on the surface of heterojunction was identified by XPS (Producer: Thermo Fisher, model number: K-Alpha).
