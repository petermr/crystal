 <caption> ( a) HRTEM micrograph of a ZnO nanospike tip, showing the characteristic superposition fringe contrast as a feature of twinning. (Inset) A TEM image of the ZnO nanospike. ( b) A precession electron diffraction pattern showing the superposition of two mirrored single-crystal patterns in orientation. The reflections of the individual twin components are indicated by the diamond and hexagon markers. </caption>
