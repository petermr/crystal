<p id="Par7">The resistivities and magnetoresistances are compared in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>. Both compounds are metallic and have large, non-classical magnetoresistances as seen for other AMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> compounds. In EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>, a sharp feature in the magnetoresistance is seen due to a metamagnetic transition in the Eu sublattice, as reported in ref.

 </sup>. For EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> the magnetism below 300 K is only due to the Eu moments as the Mn moments are locked antiferromagnetically. Additional ordering of Eu atoms seen in resistivity at ~20 K implies that the ground state of EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> is well defined and all magnetic moments, Mn and Eu, are antiferromagnetically ordered. There is no hysteresis in any of the measurements.
