<p>It is observed from a careful inspection that the new morphology suffers missing mirror plane along y-axis. We then intuitively consider Im3 as a strong candidate. For the further identification of the newly found morphology as possessing Im3 symmetry, we try to check its known equivalent Wyckoff positions.
