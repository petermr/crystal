CPE1 and R1 reflect the intra-/inter-crystalline electrical process, while CPE2 and R2 were assigned to fit the results concerning the charge transport in the grain boundary or aggregate boundary. These two circuital elements were put in series because it was the better circuit that better adjust the experimental results. Also, each of the circuital elements were connected in series because the Nyquist plot described consecutive processes [

 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The circuit was finally completed with a Warburg open element (W1). In these equivalent circuits, the constant phase elements (CPE1, CPE2) were selected based on SEM (
