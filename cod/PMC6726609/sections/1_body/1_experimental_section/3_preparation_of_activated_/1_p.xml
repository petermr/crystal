<p id="Par8">Firstly, AC and polyvinylidene fluoride according to the mass ratio of 9:1 were put into a solution of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol with volume ratio of 1:1. Then, the blended liquid was ultrasonic for 30 min in the ultrasonic device so that the solution is distributed evenly. Next, the solution is trickled onto surface of 3D Ni foam by dropwise addition. After dropping the slurry, the Ni foam was dried by blowing in the oven of 60 °C. Next, by subtracting the weight before and after the Ni foam, the mass of the supported activated carbon is about 30 mg. Last, a self-assembling routine is used to design a device from AC and the active materials to test its application.</p>
