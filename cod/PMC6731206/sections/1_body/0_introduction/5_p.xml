<p id="p0025">At the same time, there is a large field of natural resources of zeolites in the Kamchatskiy region - the Yagodnisky deposit. The deposit area is 350 hectares. The thickness of the useful stratum is 80â€“100 m. The field belongs to the hydrothermal-metasomatic type of deposits. Natural zeolite of the Yagodnisky deposit has a high cation-exchange capacity, high mechanical strength, resistance to aggressive media, which allows their use in a wide range of pH. It is used in water treatment processes 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Zeolite tuffs of the Yagodninsky deposit can be used to extract heavy metals from waste waters. It increases economic efficiency of the mining industry due to recycling of heavy metals.
