 </sup> is taken as the starting model for the Rietveld refinement of NKLSO. Three cation sites (Rb, Na1, and Na2) exist in the host, and all of them are occupied by K/Na mixed ions. The ratios are allowed to refine with restriction that the sum of occupations occ(Na) + occ(K) is equal to 1 at all sites. After preliminary refinement, it is found that the first cation is fully occupied by K
 <sup>+</sup> ions, the second site is intermixed K/Na with a ratio of 0.67/0.33, and the third site is fully occupied by Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These occupations were accounted for in the new model, and K/Na ratios were fixed in the first and third sites. The thermal parameters of all ions were refined isotropically. The as-obtained structural parameters were stable with low 
 <italic>R</italic>-factors (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1a</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). NKLSO was found to crystallize in a tetragonal crystal system with space group 
 <italic>I</italic>4/
 <italic>m</italic>, and its unit cell parameters are 
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> = 10.9447 (1) Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 6.26244 (8) Å. Coordinates of atoms and main bond lengths are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, respectively. The chemical formula from refinement can be written as Na
 <sub>0.58(4)</sub>K
 <sub>0.42(4)</sub>Li
 <sub>3</sub>SiO
 <sub>4</sub>, which is close to the suggested formula within 2σ. The crystallographic information file of NKLSO is also provided in the Supplementary Information.
