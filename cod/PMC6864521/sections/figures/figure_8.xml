  <p>a) Schematics of the rubbing process—a rubbing cloth is pressed against a spin‐coated thin film and the rotation of the fibers oppositely to the movement of the sample forms trenches and lines as the fibers push the QRs piling them up in oriented stacks. b) SEM images of a spin‐coated thin film of CdSe/CdS QRs shows no preferred directionality. c) SEM of the rubbed QR shows an alignment parallel to the rubbing direction. The inset shows absorption (black) and emission (red) spectra of the QRs. Reproduced with permission.
