<p id="Par7">The morphology of the as-synthesized NCs is investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>) show the uniformly distributed nanocubes without a change in morphology even after the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the parent NCs. However, the average side length of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> NCs decreased from ∼8.1 ± 1.4 nm to ∼7.5 ± 0.9 nm and that of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> decreased from ∼10.3 ± 1.7 nm to ∼8.41 ± 1.2 nm when the content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is increased from 0% to 15%. The decrease in particle size at high content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> may be a result of increased halide ion uptake, which hinders the crystal growth

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. The size distribution analysis of as-grown samples is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f,g</xref>. From these histograms, it can be concluded that the particle size distribution also decreases with increasing the content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>. Thus, from the XRD and TEM analysis, we found that the incorporation of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> results in the increase in periodicity and uniformity of the NCs with a decrease in NCs size.
