 </sup>, coesite-IV and coesite-V are the first experimentally observed silica polymorphs featuring SiO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra. There are two crystallographically distinctive penta-coordinated silicon atoms (Si4 and Si6) in coesite-IV and three (Si3, Si4, and Si6) in coesite-V (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although the range of Si–O bond lengths and their average are similar for all SiO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra, the shape of the polyhedra varies considerably (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), accommodating features common for a trigonal bipyramid and for a square pyramid.
