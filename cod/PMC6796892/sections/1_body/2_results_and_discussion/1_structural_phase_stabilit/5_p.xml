<p>We have also performed nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations to find out the energetics of ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition and to identify a minimum-energy path for the phase transition. To calculate the minimum-energy path, we have considered the tetragonal phase of PbVO
 <sub>3</sub> as the initial structure and the cubic phase as the tetragonal structure. Different intermediate images were created, and the energies for all of the images were calculated considering the volume as well as shape variation. The energies obtained are plotted versus the images (here mentioned as reaction coordinates). The graph given in

 </xref> results from NEB calculations, which shows that the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition involves an energy barrier of 127 meV, which is higher than the difference between the ground-state total energies of these two phases, i.e., ∼70 meV. It also shows the V–O coordinated polyhedra. In the case of ferroelectric phase, the V–O polyhedron is highly distorted and makes a pyramidal arrangement. The intermediate images along the FE-to-PE transition path with higher energies than the FE phase possess comparatively less distorted polyhedra. Finally, the end product, i.e., the paraelectric phase, exhibits an undistorted octahedron. The high energy barrier for the phase transition is consistent with the high-temperature FE-to-PE phase transition.
