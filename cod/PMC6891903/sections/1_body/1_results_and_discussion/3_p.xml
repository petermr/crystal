 </xref>. First, the composite materials were sequentially stacked layer by layer on a glass substrate (5 × 10 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). The ZnS:Cu+PDMS and TPU film respectively serve as the luminescent layer and the electrification layer, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Second, the film was sliced into two parts, where the ratio of sliced to unsliced is 4:1 along the width direction (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The sliced section was cut into strips with a width of 3 mm to increase the contact area (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, the photograph is shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information). The wind speed sensor is composed of four major parts as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d and was fabricated by the process described in the Experimental Section. A cylinder was used to support the whole device, which not only enclosed the entire structure within a confined channel to conduct the wind but also concentrated the TIEL. A hollow ring with four cross‐shaped ridges was used to adhere to the TIEL materials, which were then inserted into the four grooves of the cylinder. The as‐prepared film was rolled and fixed into the uncut part (upstream side). The rest of the sliced part was isolated from layers and maintained flexible at the downstream, which was followed by a perovskite‐based PD and a round base. Two lead wires were connected to the PD for electrical measurement. Figure

 <sup>3</sup> without TIEL material, which was fabricated by 3D printing techniques.
