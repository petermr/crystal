<p>In this article, we study structural, electronic, spectroscopic and optical properties of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> dichalcogenide using first-principle calculations. As the density functional theory (DFT) is considered as one of the most effective and accurate computational methods, we investigate the electronic band structure of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> employing DFT analysis. We report accurate electronic band structure of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> based on a hybrid density functional (HSE06) calculations. The calculated HSE06 band structure for this compound helps to identify the type of band gap TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> possess and its value, authenticating the suitability for the solar cell application. We also study the structural stability and mechanical stability of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub>. To verify the Raman active (R-active) and infrared active (IR-active) modes with previously published experimental results [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we simulated the Raman spectra and infrared spectra of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub>.
