 </xref> summarizes the reactions with luminescence intensity change by coordination/dissociation of the Re–N(aromatic) coordination bond and the formation/dissociation of the N–H···N hydrogen bond on the basis of solvent-free reactions and exposure of water. The solid mixture of 
 <bold>2</bold> and 1 mol equiv of Him was mechanically ground on an alumina mortar at room temperature. The bright yellow-green luminescence of 
 <bold>2</bold> gradually disappeared to give 
 <bold>5</bold>. Complex 
 <bold>5</bold> was also afforded by the mechanochemical reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> with 2 mol equiv of Him at room temperature.

 </xref> shows the luminescence intensity change during the mechanochemical reaction of the solid sample of 
 <bold>1</bold> with 2 mol equiv of Him. The IR spectra and powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the obtained solids by these reactions are identical with that of 
 <bold>5</bold> as shown in
