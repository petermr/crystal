<p>In order to prepare nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, an IS-RPB reactor was used for the immediate precipitation process with NH
 <sub>3</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O as a precipitant, as in the studies of Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Jiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The details of the reactor are as follows: the packing was made by stainless steel wire meshes with a 2.5 mm diameter—the inter diameter, outer diameter and axial height of which, respectively, were 60 mm, 160 mm and 60 mm—and was connected to the motor by shaft. Two jet nozzles with a 1.5 mm diameter were employed in the opposite direction to cause solutions to be ejected to form an impinging stream. Others elements included the liquid inlet/outlet, a shell with a 200 mm diameter, et al.
