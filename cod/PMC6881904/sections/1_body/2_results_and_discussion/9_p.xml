<p>For lighting phosphors, the working temperature would be much higher than room temperature. Although pc-LEDs are significantly more energy efficient light source than incandescent lighting, about 50–70% of the electricity supplied to an LED still becomes heat rather than light, and in high power packages in a more confined space, this can lead to an operating temperature of 150–200 °C during LEDs operation, which efficiently quenches photoluminescence via fast NR of excited electrons to the ground state of activators.
