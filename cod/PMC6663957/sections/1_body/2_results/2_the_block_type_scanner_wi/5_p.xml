<p id="Par52">Line profiles across spherical sources with different diameters are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. The average PTV ratio for these line profiles is higher for the block model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). It is almost twice the cylindrical model, e.g., 3.63 and 2.07 for the 1.8 mm spheres, respectively. Line profiles indicate that the PTV ratio decreases from the peripheral area to the center of the phantom. It also decreases by decreasing the source size.
