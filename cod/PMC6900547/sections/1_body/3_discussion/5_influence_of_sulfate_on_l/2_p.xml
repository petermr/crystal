<p>Lithium has a clear affinity for sulfate in the experiments, demonstrated by SO
 <sub>4</sub> adsorption and the modification of the crystal morphology both in the computational simulations and experiments. Ion pair formation in solution is known to generate new bands in the Raman spectra of solutions which are present at slightly higher wavenumbers for oxyanions such as sulfate,

 </sup> as well as changes to the band position and symmetry for Li sulfate ion pairs in pure solutions at room temperature above concentrations of 0.2 molality.

 </sup> The strong hydration of Li
 <sup>+</sup> results in the ion pairs being solvent mediated rather than contact ion pairs at the temperature of our experiments.

 </sup> The increase in the band FWHM
 <sub>960</sub> in the presence of Li indicates that Li-sulfate ion pairs were formed in our solutions in agreement with the PHREEQC simulations. Thus, Li
 <sup>+</sup> can effectively outcompete Na
 <sup>+</sup> to form ion pairs with sulfate in solution. The formation of ion pairs with sulfate is known to limit the nucleation of carbonate minerals.

 </sup> Therefore, in the experiments with Na-sulfate the decrease in Li
 <sup>+</sup> and CO

 <sup>2â€“</sup> ion activities due to the formation of ion pairs with sulfate and Na
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively, would lower the supersaturation of the system with respect to zabuyelite. Again, the formation of rosettes and hollow centers in many of the crystals implies that the nucleation is not limited sufficiently to alter the nucleation mechanism.
