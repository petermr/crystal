 <caption> Comparison of X-ray photoemission spectra collected for pristine and BiI 3-covered Bi 2Se 3 (0001) collected at a photon energy of h ν = 200 eV. The photoemission intensities are plotted on a log-scale and are shifted for clarity. Solid areas below the core level photoemission peaks indicate the fitted line shapes. Note the very low Te-4d emission indicating the presence of almost pure BiI 3. The spin-orbit split Bi-5d lines exhibit a chemical shift of about 0.6 eV related to different Bi environments. </caption>
