<p>While we started the discussion from semimetallic monosilicides, we note that the band structures of all considered transition-metal monosilicides of the fourth, fifth, and sixth periods are given in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the density of states for the three selected semiconducting compounds (FeSi, RuSi, and OsSi) representing the monosilicides of fourth, fifth, and sixth rows of the Periodic Table. In the whole considered energy range, the main contribution to DOS came from metal d-states and silicon p-states.
