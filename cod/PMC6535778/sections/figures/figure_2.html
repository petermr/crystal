 <caption> Field-dependent, direction-dependent, and temperature-dependent magnetic properties of EuSn 2P 2. (A) Field-dependent magnetization for the two crystal orientations measured at 2 K where red balls and blue squares represent magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis, respectively. (B) Magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature measured in an external field of μ 0 H = 500 Oe, both perpendicular (blue) and parallel (red) to the c-axis. The inset shows the temperature-dependent inverse susceptibility, measured for different sample orientations. The green line is the Curie–Weiss fit to the high-temperature data. </caption>
