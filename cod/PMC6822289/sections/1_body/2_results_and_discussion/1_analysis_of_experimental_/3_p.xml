<p>Lukose et al. found that the minimum energy configuration for these COFs has a slightly tilted stacking.

 </sup> Instead of the perfectly aligned AA and AB, COF-1 and COF-5 were found to have its minimum energy when the layers have an offset of ca. 1.4. This misalignment was shown to be hard to distinguish from the experimental PXDR pattern, and it is better to rely on computational methods. Recognizing the correct stacking is indeed a crucial aspect for many applications,

 </sup> and particularly for gas adsorption, where a shifted or staggered configuration results in a shrinking of the channel diameter, possibly blocking the channels to the diffusion of gas molecules.
