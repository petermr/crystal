<p id="Par58">In 2D-SAROM setup, the collimated beam from laser was expanded in beam expander (two NIR coated spherical lenses, f1 = 20 mm (Edmund Optics, cat. no. 45–792) and f2 = 100 mm (Edmund Optics, cat. no. 45–806)) up to the diameter of 10 mm. Expanded beam was divided into three beams by a set of beamsplitters BS1-BS3 and polarized BS1 (Edmund Optics, cat. no. 49–005, Edmund Optics, cat. no. 49–870).</p>
