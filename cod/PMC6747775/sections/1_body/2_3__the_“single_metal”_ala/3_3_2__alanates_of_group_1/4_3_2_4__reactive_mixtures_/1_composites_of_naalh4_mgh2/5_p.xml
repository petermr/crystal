<p>Only the first three reactions are relevant for hydrogen storage purposes. The reported values of hydrogen released in the first cycle of dehydrogenation ranged between 6.7–7.2 wt.% [

 <xref rid="B155-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. However, these values consider the decomposition of NaH. Prolonged ball milling or the use of catalysts produced a decrement of the activation energy and dehydrogenation temperatures in all steps [

Regarding the reversibility, up to six hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles have been demonstrated when the composite is mixed with carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets. In this case, the hydrogen storage level is around 3.5 wt.% at 275 °C and 76 bar [
