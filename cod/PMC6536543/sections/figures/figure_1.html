 <caption> Structures of Ca 5(Si 2O 7)(CO 3) 2 tilleyite (top) and high-pressure post-tilleyite (bottom) projected along the three unitcell axes. Blue, light gray, light green and red spheres represent C, Si, Ca and O atoms, respectively. Cell edges are depicted as solid black lines. Red solid lines on post-tilleyite projections demarcate the location of tilleyite unitcell contents, for the sake of comparison between structures. </caption>
