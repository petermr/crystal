<p>In chiral self-sorting SCCs, either homo- or heterochiral complexes are formed exclusively through high fidelity recognition of the components within the complex [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The formation of such complexes with high selectivity and well-defined chirality is essential for the application of SCCs towards chiral recognition and sensing [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge no self-sorted responsive SCCs have been reported so far.
