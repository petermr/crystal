<p>The exciton binding energy (

 <sub>b</sub>) and bandgap of 2D perovskites are more significantly affected by dielectric and quantum confinement effects than those of 3D perovskites.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> In general, the dielectric constant of organic layers is much smaller than that of inorganic layers. In this case, the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the hole will be stronger because of the small shielding effect. So, the exciton binding energy of 2D perovskites is almost five times as high as that of 3D analogues.
