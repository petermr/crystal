<p>The new structure does not alter the primary conclusions of our manuscript:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>The C-terminal part of the active site of 
    <italic>Tm</italic>TsaD remains well-structured and is still capable of binding a nucleotide in the context of the ternary 
    <italic>Tm</italic>TsaBDE complex.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The AMPCPP occupies exactly the same position as the carboxy-AMP compound present in the recent structure of 
    <italic>Tm</italic>TsaBDE, reported by Swairjo 
    <italic>et al.</italic> (
    <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). We further confirm that in our structure the N-terminal part of the 
    <italic>Tm</italic>TsaD active site remains partially disordered and that neither Zn nor Fe ions are bound. This contrasts with the structure reported by Swairjo 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, which has an ordered metal binding site occupied by Zn. This latter structure was obtained in presence of ATP, and we suspect that the nature of the bound nucleotide (AMPCPP versus ATP) might play a role in the metal binding. The two structures of the TsaBDE complex (6N9A and 6S84) represent probably different snapshots along the catalytic pathway.
