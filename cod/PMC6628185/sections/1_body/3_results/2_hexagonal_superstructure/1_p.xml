<p>We probed the phonons of TSL NWs by inelastic light-scattering experiments. The expected phonon modes at the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone were computed with ab initio density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations

 <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="other">Computational Methods</xref>. Polarization-resolved Raman scattering experiments and calculations were performed in backscattering geometry. The incident photon wavevector (

 <sub>i</sub>) is antiparallel to the 
 <italic>x</italic>-axis and the scattered photon wavevector (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>) is parallel to 
 <italic>x</italic>. As a consequence, the incident and scattered light polarization vectors, 
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> and 
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>, lie in the 
 <italic>yz</italic> plane, which is the plane of the sample. 
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> and 
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>s</sub> can be separately controlled to obtain the desired scattering geometries. The scattering configuration is expressed in the Porto notation,

 <sub>s</sub>: the outer terms, from left to right, refer to the excitation and scattering direction of the light, respectively, and the inner bracket refers to the excitation and detection polarizations. The main scattering geometries used in this work are the

 <italic>z</italic>-axis of the reference system. In particular, the WZ [01̅10], [21̅1̅0], and [0001̅] axes were along 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>, and the TSL [011], [21̅1], and [111̅] axes were along 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>. The reference bulk GaP was a (111)B substrate tilted in order to lie in the 
 <italic>xz</italic> plane and to have the (011) surface lying on the 
 <italic>yz</italic> plane.
