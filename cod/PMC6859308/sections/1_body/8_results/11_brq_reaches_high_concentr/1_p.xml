<p>We measured concentration of Br in the lumen of the parasitic digestive vacuole in BrQ-treated parasites by counting Br atoms in 4 infected red blood cells (iRBCs

The number of Br atoms was divided by the corresponding volume within each of the digestive vacuoles yielding Br concentrations. This concentration reaches a magnitude similar to what has been reported for chloroquine (

We found that BrQ accumulated in the digestive vacuoles, reaching concentrations of 150 ± 50 μM, even though BrQ was introduced into the culture medium at the concentrations as low as 40 nM and 150 nM. The concentration of BrQ in the digestive vacuole was measured in a more direct manner than previously reported for chloroquine, albeit in fewer cells.
