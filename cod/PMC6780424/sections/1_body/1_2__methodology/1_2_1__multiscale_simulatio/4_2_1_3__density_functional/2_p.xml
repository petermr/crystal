<p>In order to improve the computational capability of the dynamics simulation method, we reconstructed the HASEM software based on the J parallel adaptive structured mesh applications infrastructure (JASMIN), which has successfully accelerated many parallel programs for large scale simulations of complex applications on parallel computers [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Through this, the calculation efficiency of HASEM software was improved by one order of magnitude. Simulations of large-scale systems containing ~1000 atoms can thereby be achieved by using extended central processing units (CPUs) on supercomputers.
