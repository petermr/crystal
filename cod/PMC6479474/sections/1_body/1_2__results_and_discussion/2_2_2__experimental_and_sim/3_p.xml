<p>The agreement with the experimental spectrum is slightly lower in the 5200–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region, as the level of band overlapping is very high there. In contrast, the upper NIR region (ca. 6900–6450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) was accurately reproduced in the calculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The first overtones and the binary combinations bands of NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching modes populate this region (as the primary contributions). Similar to other kinds of X-H vibrations (e.g., OH), these modes are expected in the literature to be sensitive to the molecules’ chemical neighborhood, e.g., prone to red-shifting in hydrogen-bonded complexes. This effect has been clearly observed for alcohols [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Surprisingly, in the case of melamine it may be concluded that the first overtones and binary combinations bands of NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching modes are properly reproduced, even in the simplified case of an isolated molecule, for which the inter-molecular interactions are not reflected (
