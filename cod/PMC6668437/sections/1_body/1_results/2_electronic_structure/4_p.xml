<p id="Par14">The pronounced dichotomy between EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> in terms of degeneracy of the electronic states should be detectable by other experiments. We have studied both single crystals by means of magneto-optical microscopy. By employing a Kerr microscope
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, which is adjusted to be sensitive to the Voigt effect at perpendicular light incidence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>, it turned out to be possible to visualize areas (“domains”) with different in-plane FM component of the Mn magnetization. This is demonstrated in the left column of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. If domains show up with maximum contrast at a given sample orientation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), the contrast disappears upon sample rotation by 45°. This contrast symmetry is in agreement with the Voigt effect that is quadratic in the in-plane component of the magnetization (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Since the measurements were carried out in zero magnetic field, it follows from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, that the averaging of the observed domains over the whole bulk sample will not result in significant net magnetization. Contrary to YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>, no contrast can be observed at any sample orientation in case of the EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> crystal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) as expected for a pure AFM in which the magnetic moments are aligned strictly perpendicular to the sample surface with no canting. The observed domain contrast in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> cannot arise from structural features as the samples are single crystals and the cleavage planes of both materials are the same (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The record sharpness of the quasi-2D ARPES features leaves no doubt as for their quality. The particular magnetic domain structure observed in the sample is most likely formed during the crystal growth process.
