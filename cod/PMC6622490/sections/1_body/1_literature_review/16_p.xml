<p>The panels also save the most recurrent frequencies at their location, allowing preemptive adjustment to maximize efficiency of energy conversion. Each panel has a piezoelectric transducer that transforms the sound vibrations into an electrical current that is stored in a unit at the end of each band and then transferred to a building storage compartment that regulates the towerâ€™s electrical needs [
