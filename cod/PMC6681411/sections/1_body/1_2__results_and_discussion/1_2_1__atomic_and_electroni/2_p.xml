 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-02667">Tables S1 and S2</xref> in the supporting information. Within each unit cell the Li, Al, Cl, O, and H atoms occupy five inequivalent atomic sites, respectively. The Cl atoms are located on a mirror plane between two neighboring [LiAl

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02667-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The Cl–Li distances are much longer (3.56 Å), indicating that the Cl atoms are mainly stabilized by bonding to the H atoms of the hydroxyl groups. As a result, the H atoms of the six hydroxyl groups point towards the Cl atoms in contrast to the situation found in Al(OH)

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-02667">Figure S1</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02667-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, both the Al and Li atoms are coordinated with six O atoms forming distorted AlO
 <sub>6</sub> and LiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra, respectively. The H atoms are bonded to the O atoms forming hydroxyl groups, with distances of 0.979 Å. Note that the bond lengths of Al–O (1.907 Å) and Li–O (2.132 Å) within each octahedra are equal, while the bond angles of ∠O–Al–O and ∠O–Li–O range from 77.3° to 96.1° and 79.3° and 100.6°, respectively. Therefore, the LiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra are slightly more distorted than the AlO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. Besides, each LiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra shares edges with six AlO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra, which together with the H atoms form positively charged [LiAl
