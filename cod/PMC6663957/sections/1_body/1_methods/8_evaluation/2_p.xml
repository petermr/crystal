<p id="Par44">Line profiles were generated along spheres with a different diameter in Derenzo phantoms. The Derenzo data taken by the 
 <italic>Scanner B</italic> were evaluated in more details in terms of peak-to-valley (PTV) and spill-over (SOR) ratios for both cylindrical and block models. Two ROIs were drawn around each individual sphere in the Derenzo phantom. One of them was a spherical ROI as large as the sphere itself, and the other an annular ROI with the inner diameter as large as the sphere diameter and the outer diameter twice the sphere diameter (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The SOR was calculated as the ratio of the mean of the annular ROI to the mean of the spherical ROI.
