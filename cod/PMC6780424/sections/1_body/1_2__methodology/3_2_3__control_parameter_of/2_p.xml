<p>We defined the chemical bonds as broken when they were stretched to a cutoff percentage relative to each equilibrium state. The cutoff criterion was 20% on average, but it varied from 10% to 40% for different types of bonds. The criterion for each type of bond was determined by the statistics of the reaction products of the TATB explosive when the number of product molecules best agreed with the number of the stable clusters with a life span more than hundreds of time steps during the kinetics simulation.</p>
