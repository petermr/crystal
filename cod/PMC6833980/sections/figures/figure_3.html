 <caption> ( a) A schematic diagram of the measuring system. x L is the distance between the incident point of the X-rays and the crystal edge of the entrance surface. SC1 and SC2 are the scintillation counters set up in the reflected- and transmitted-wave directions, respectively. ( b) Sample geometries. ( c) and ( d) the incident- and reflected-wave geometries with respect to the samples for β &gt; 0 and β &lt; 0, respectively. ( e) The measured rocking curves of P h, P t and P r. </caption>
