<p id="Par13">Averages in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> were calculated over 2 million lattice-steps after the system was equilibrated at each temperature. Using the estimate of 1 MMC lattice-step ≈0.03 ps, the following cooling/warming rates were applied along the annealing process. A first cooling process gave rise to the liquid-amorphous branch of higher enthalpy and volume in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> by: (i) cooling from 700 to 150 K at a rate of 287 K/

 <italic>μ</italic>s enabled the system to reach a state of crystal character at 160 K (lowest temperature the system reached a crystal state from the upper branch), (iii) cooling from 150 to 50 K at 380 K/
