<p id="Par13">An alternative explanation for the improved catalytic activity that needs to be excluded is the generation of new active sites (e.g., by generating tellurium vacancies through the leaching of cations/anions). In such a scenario, a change in catalyst composition would be expected. However, ICP-OES measurements show the stoichiometry of the nanocrystalline phase to be MoTe
 <sub>1.97(5)</sub> and MoTe
 <sub>1.98(2)</sub> before and after 100 cycles, respectively (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These results therefore prove that the stoichiometry remains constant with continuous cycling. The similarity in morphology before and after cycling thus rules out the effect of nanostructuring as the origin of enhanced catalytic activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).
