<p>Optical rotation values were obtained on a JASCO P-1010 polarimeter at the sodium D line (589 nm). UV spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR instrument. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance and Avance III spectrometers at 500.13 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 125.76 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C. DEPT, COSY-45, gTOCSY, gROESY, gHSQC, gHMQC and gHMBC spectra were recorded using standard Bruker pulse sequences. NMR chemical shifts were referenced to TMS δ
 <sub>H</sub> and δ
 <sub>C</sub> = 0 ppm. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Waters MaldiSynapt instrument (ESI) and LC-MS spectra were recorded on a Waters Xevo TQD instrument (ESI). HPLC separations were performed on a Merck Hitachi HPLC system (L-6200 Intelligent pump and L-4200 UV-VIS detector), a JASCO P4-2080 plus HPLC system with a multiwavelength detector and an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system.
