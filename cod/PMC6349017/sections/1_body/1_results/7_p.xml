 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> shows the calculated proton transfer free-energy landscapes (PTFELs) for the surface-PT and adlayer-PT coordinates at the ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surfaces. Further, top views of the surfaces with only the species participating in the PT reaction are given. The PTFELs give the free-energy barriers Δ

 <sup>‡</sup> for transferring the proton from the donor to the acceptor, given that the corresponding donor–acceptor pair has already formed and that the proton is deemed active for PT (see Methods). The PTFEL is presented as a one-dimensional function of the PT coordinate

 <sub>min</sub>, which is the difference between the covalent and noncovalent O–H distances; this geometric viewpoint is sufficient for our present purposes. However, the PTFEL is a many-body function, and other relevant coordinates that can be used to characterize it are, for example, the O–O distances,
