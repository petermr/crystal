<p class="p">We reproduced the structure by analyzing another single crystal obtained in another synthesized batch, demonstrating the reliability of our experimental results. The reliable structure provides a prerequisite to investigating the thermodynamic influence on the structure of the Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SCH

 <sub class="sub">60</sub> nanoparticles. As shown in fig. S12 and tables S3 to S6, the structural framework is essentially unchanged as the temperature increases from 100 K (0.84-Å resolution) to 243 K (0.83-Å resolution). However, the Au–Au bond length changes are distinctly observed when the temperature rises from 100 to 243 K. All Au–Au bond lengths in the Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> core elongate more or less as the temperature increases. More specifically, the Au–Au bonds in the inner shell elongate from 2.748 to 2.758 Å, and the Au–Au bonds in the second shell elongate from 2.917 to 2.922 Å. The two kinds of Au–Au bonds in the third shell stretch from 3.220 to 3.224 Å and 2.883 to 2.895 Å, respectively. The small-angle XRD analysis also qualitatively reveals that the distance between the two neighboring nanoparticles in the amorphous powder enlarges as the temperature increases, indicating that the nanoparticles expand with the temperature rise (fig. S13). An interesting finding is that the Au–Au bonds with a length close to that of bulk gold (2.88 Å) have the largest elongation (+0.41%), indicating that this kind of bond has better thermal extensibility than the shorter or longer ones, which may provide the atomic-level perspective for the fact that metals generally show better thermal extensibility than nonmetal solid materials.
