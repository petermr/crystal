 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> revealed that some orientations, like those appearing in the surface plane (111) of Si, are prone to introduce ambiguity in measurement data. Although simulation helped to define minimal number of polarization channels required to determine orientation, it still has limited scope, because only (100), (110), and (111) cases were considered.
