<p id="Par8">The effect of the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> on the optical properties of CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> perovskites is characterized by measuring PL and absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The normalized PL and absorption spectra of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> exhibit a modest blue-shift with increasing Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> content in the host materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–d</xref>). Since both the Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> precursors contain the same halides, this paves a pathway for the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions upon its introduction into the host CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> matrix and favors the change in the optical properties of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-alloyed NCs. As-grown CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> NCs exhibit PL emission in the violet region with emission peak attenuated from 417 nm to 411 nm (excited at 300 nm), whereas CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs, show the green emission which is tuned from 522 nm to 517 nm (excited at 365 nm). This blue-shift in the optical properties is related to the slight decrease in the size of the NCs that can be ascribed to the weak quantum confinement effect. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of PL emissions of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> NCs is decreased from 13.4 nm to 12.8 nm and that of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs is decreased from 16.9 nm to 15.5 nm when the content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is increased from 0% to 15%. The narrow FWHM shows that the obtained NCs are uniformly distributed and decreased FWHM indicates an increase in the uniformity in the size distribution of NCs. This observation is also in agreement with the TEM images. In addition, the reduced FWHM of PL emission is advantageous for the fabrication of energy-efficient LEDs with high color purity. The UV-visible absorption spectra show a well-defined absorption peak for all the samples
