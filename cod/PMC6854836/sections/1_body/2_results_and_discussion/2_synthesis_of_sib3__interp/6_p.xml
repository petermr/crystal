<p>For 1:4 reaction mixtures (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b), we observed an increased reaction rate compared to 1:3 mixtures. Complete consumption of Si was observed at 1225 °C after only 6 h, at 1200 °C after 16 h, and at 1150 °C after 40 h. At the same time, it is clear that excess B promotes the formation of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, which was obtained in substantial amounts (25–50%) at 1150–1200 °C after 40 h.
