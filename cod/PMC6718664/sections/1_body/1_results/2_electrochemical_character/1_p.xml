<p id="Par6">The effects of structural rearrangement via partial dehydration on electrochemical properties are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The first charge curve demonstrates that both hydrated and partially dehydrated Na-bir have similar charge capacities corresponding to ~0.275 mol of Na ions, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>. However, the partially dehydrated Na-bir displays much higher first discharge capacity than the hydrated Na-bir. This increased capability seems to originate from the activation of Na-occupying sites induced by the structural rearrangement. This inference is clearly confirmed in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>, where, in the absence of an initial charge, the partially dehydrated Na-bir can accommodate additional ~0.1 mol Na ions compared to its hydrated counterpart. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–d</xref> show the charge/discharge profiles of Na-birs at the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th, 50th, and 100th cycles at 0.1 C between 1.5 and 4.3 V and the corresponding differential capacity vs. voltage plots (d
 <italic>Q</italic>/d
 <italic>V</italic>). An anodic peak at ~2.5 V is coupled with the corresponding cathodic peak at ~2.4 V, which can be attributed to the redox reaction of Mn
 <sup>3+/4+</sup>. Above 3.0 V, the peaks related to complex structural changes can be observed, although they remain more apparent up to the 100th cycle in the partially dehydrated Na-bir. These results indicate that the partially dehydrated Na-bir showed a high electrochemical reversibility and, correspondingly, exhibited a much improved cyclic retention up to 100 cycles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Moreover, the partially dehydrated Na-bir retained a discharge capacity of 150 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 100 cycles, corresponding to 75% of its initial discharge capacity, while the hydrated Na-bir retained only 32% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles. The improved cycling stability of partially dehydrated Na-bir is quite impressive because high capacity at higher voltage range induced fast degradation in conventional layered materials. Furthermore, the kinetic advantage of partially dehydrated Na-bir is also demonstrated by the rate capability test (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). When the partially dehydrated Na-bir is charged and discharged at 5 C, it could still exhibit 87.96 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to 44% of the discharge capacity at 0.1 C. To further investigate the kinetic properties of Na-bir, Na
 <sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficients are obtained from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It was very clear that controlling the crystal water contents can facilitate the phase transformation from layered to spinel-like structure, which provides higher Na
 <sup>+</sup> diffusion environment in the structure. Therefore, the role of crystal water contents looks critical for the electrochemical performances of Na-bir. To make sure this point, we also analyzed the electrochemical performances of fully dehydrated Na-bir which was heat-treated at 300
 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h. Interestingly, as Nam et al. reported
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, the fully dehydrated Na-bir shows the most inferior electrochemical performances among the samples underscoring the importance of proper contents of crystal water in the structure (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
