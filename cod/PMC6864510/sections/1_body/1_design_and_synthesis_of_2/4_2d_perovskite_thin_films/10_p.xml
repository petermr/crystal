The lateral dimension was controlled from 5 to 10 µm. Figure

 <sub>2</sub> platelets—the perovskite platelet thickness was achieved by adjusting the thickness of the relevant lead halide platelets. Similar work has been reported by Shi's group. They demonstrated that weak van der Waals force played an important role in the growth of large‐sized single‐crystal 2D perovskites. Ionic crystals with delocalized bonds are more likely to form ultrathin structures than covalent compounds with localized bonds.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">74</xref> By adjusting the pressure, temperature, and other conditions during the conversion process, it is expected to produce 2D mixed lead halide perovskites and realize a broad range adjustment of wavelength. In addition, there are other methods to prepare 2D perovskites, such as mechanical exfoliation
