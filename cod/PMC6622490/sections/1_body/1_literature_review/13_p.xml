<p>PZT transducer has many features that make it capable of converting sound energy to electric energy; it has huge efficient piezoelectric material that can convert up to 80% of mechanical energy to electricity, it has high piezoelectric voltage and high voltage conversion, it can generate power that can be stored in a battery as DC power. The generated electrical power can instantly be used to power microelectronic devices like Bluetooth, GPS modules, micro-controllers and low power units. As the material is quite robust it can be embedded in a variety of structures, on walls, under floors, roads, sidewalks and street furniture. [
