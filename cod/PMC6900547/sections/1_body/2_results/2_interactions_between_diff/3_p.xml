<p>To determine whether the formation of ion pairs was significant in our experiments, we examined changes in the symmetrical stretch band for sulfate (985 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> and carbonate (1067 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
 </sup> in different solutions. Positions for the sulfate and carbonate Raman bands in the solutions are listed in the

 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution was observed at 1067 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. Similarly, the carbonate band was observed at 1067 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> in aqueous solutions equilibrated with Li-carbonate; however, a shoulder was also observed in some of the Raman spectra (

 </xref>a). The shoulder band at 1076 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> decreased in intensity with increasing concentrations of Li-carbonate in solution. In repeated equilibration experiments, the shoulder band was no longer detectable indicating a higher concentration of Li
 <sup>+</sup> and CO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> in solution. Increasing the temperature of the solution did not change the center position or full width half maximum (FWHM) of the carbonate band in these solutions. This is similar to the lack of change in the band center and FWHM with temperature for the Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution. In the presence of LiBr, however, the SO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> symmetrical stretch increased in FWHM with increasing temperature but did not systematically change its center position. Increasing temperature also produced a decreasing ratio between bands associated with the tetrahedral structure (3050 and 3255 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) and hydrogen bonding network (3393, 3511, and 3628 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>)
