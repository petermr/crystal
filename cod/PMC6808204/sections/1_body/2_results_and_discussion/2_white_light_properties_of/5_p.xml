<p>In this sense, three different color conversion layers varying in their fiber mass have been prepared. Then, each sample, corresponding to a particular fiber mass, was squeezed between two thin glass slides. The corresponding spectra are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> together with the resulting optical properties including CRI, CCT, LER and luminous flux. The PL spectra of the white light generated by employing color conversion layers with different amounts of PVP/N-CDot fibers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) indicate that the ratio of the blue and green emission bands is dramatically reduced as the fiber amount increases, comparable to the results derived from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. The PL spectrum of the WLED containing 10 mg of the fibers does not show any particular green emission band and is rather dominated by the blue emission coming from the blue LED chip. In the case of the color conversion layers comprising 20 mg of the fibers, the green emission of the N-CDots reaches almost the same intensity as the blue emission, and the green emission becomes more intense than the blue when the fiber amount is set to 30 mg. Hence, without dealing with the N-CDot amount directly, one can tune the spectral shape of the generated white light just by adjusting the mass of the fibers integrated into the WLEDs. The resulting optical properties are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>. The WLEDs containing 10 mg of fiber yield no valid CRI and CCT values since the ratio of the blue and green emission is inadequate for producing satisfactory white light. On the other hand, as the fiber content increases, the CRI becomes 86 at 20 mg and reaches a value of 90 at 30 mg, indicating very good white-light properties suitable for possible white-light applications. Meanwhile, the CCT value is 11000 K at 20 mg and reduces dramatically to 6000 K as the fiber amount is increased to 30 mg. Thus, one can adjust the generated white light from a cool white to a warm white simply by incorporating more fibers into the color conversion layers. Again, we would like to stress that these PVP/N-CDot composite fibers were prepared using the N-CDot mixture that yielded no valid CRI and CCT when processed into a drop-cast film – yet, high CRI and low CCT values could be achieved here by adjusting the amount of the fibers incorporated into the WLEDs. The highest CRI and the lowest CCT values are obtained from the WLEDs with 30 mg of the fibers and are comparable to the values obtained using the drop-cast films containing the highest amount of PVP/N-CDots (50 μL, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In summary, using electrospun fibers allows one to reduce the amount of N-CDots used and to obtain adequate white-light properties. These results can be explained by the significantly enhanced multiple-scattering in the conversion layers containing the composite fibers due to their nonuniform structure full of scattering centers. As a consequence, more N-CDots can interact with the incoming blue light thanks to the multiple-scattering in the layers, and the N-CDot emission is reinforced. Moreover, the LER of the generated white light improves upon adding more fibers to the color conversion layers. For instance, the LER is 140 lm/W at 10 mg and reaches up to 201 lm/W at 20 mg. However, in line with the results derived from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, the LER decreases again when more fibers are included in the color conversion layers. This is due to the inadequate 
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic> level as the PL intensity is dramatically reduced. The PL intensity loss can be retraced in terms of the luminous flux, which is also a function of the fiber amount. Going from 10 mg to 30 mg of incorporated fibers, the total visible light output of the WLEDs reduces from 41 to 24 lm, corresponding to a reduction of almost 41%. This effect supports the proposed idea that incorporating a larger amount of fibers causes an enhancement of the scattering of the blue light within the color conversion layers and thus diminishes the PL intensity. The CIE color coordinates presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> proceed from blue to white (center values) when increasing the fiber amount from 10 mg to 30 mg. More precisely, the WLEDs containing 10 mg of fiber have a CIE of (0.20, 0.15), while the CIE is shifted towards the white at 20 mg (0.26, 0.31) and almost reaches the center at 30 mg (0.31, 0.36), indicating that white-light properties are gradually achieved.
