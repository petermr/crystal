 </sup> pseudopotentials with Ti(3s, 3p, 3d, 4s), O(2s, 2p), and H(1s) shells treated as valence electrons and modeled the unreconstructed rutile (011) surface using a 9.213 Å × 10.922 Å (2 × 2) surface supercell using the gamma point only for reciprocal space integration. Our slab model contained 4 TiO
 <sub>2</sub> tri-layers for a total thickness of 9.07 Å and a vacuum gap of 10.96 Å. For all calculations, the atoms in the bottom-most trilayer were kept fixed at their bulk positions. All other coordinates were relaxed until forces converged below 0.05 eV/Å. Water/OH was adsorbed at monolayer coverage on all under-coordinated Ti
 <sub>5c</sub> sites on the surface.
