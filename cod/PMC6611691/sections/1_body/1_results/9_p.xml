<p>Inspection of the atomic configuration within the unit cell in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> reveals that θ
 <sub>CR</sub> corresponds very closely (in one of its two possible orientations) to an axis that passes directly through the poles of the MoO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra [i.e., the interchain direction, conventionally denoted by [−2 0 1] as acknowledged previously in (

 </xref>)]. From the analysis presented in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, we conclude that the negative MR contribution is minimized when the field is oriented along this specific polar axis, implying that the MR response of this bulk 3D crystal is governed by the real-space alignment of the atoms within the crystal lattice. Such a deviation in the symmetry of the MR from the crystal main axes may take place, for instance, in materials that are susceptible to a charge density wave (CDW) instability that is not necessarily aligned with the crystal main axis. In this case however, the asymmetry can be deduced almost entirely from the nesting conditions defined by the Fermi surface (

 </xref>). Another example is a material with strong (e.g., Hubbard type) localization where, because electrons or holes spend most of their lifetime in the local atomic orbitals, it makes sense that the characteristics of local orbitals in real space become dominant. The uniqueness of LMO thus stems from the fact that in this system, which is nonetheless described well by itinerant electron physics, a signal is detected that can be ascribed directly to the local system of coordinates of atomic orbitals. Below, we introduce a model that can qualitatively explain this unprecedented effect.
