<p id="Par6">Powder and single-crystal XRD measurements on tilleyite were performed under compression. The initial sample can be described with a monoclinic 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>n</italic> space group and lattice parameters: 
 <italic>a</italic> = 7.582(4) Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 10.265(4) Å, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 15.030(6) Å and 
 <italic>β</italic> = 103.99(2)° (V = 1135.0(9) Å
 <sup>3</sup>, Z = 4), which are in excellent agreement with previously reported cell dimensions of other Crestmore specimens (once expressed in the same crystallographic setting). The structure is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref> and the atomic coordinates of the 22 independent atoms within the unit cell at ambient conditions are collected in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> of the Supplementary Information, SI (to be compared with literature data of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The topological features of the structure are the same as previously determined, but a brief summary is needed to analyze subsequent structural transformations. In tilleyite, two [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] tetrahedra share a common O atom to form a disilicate [Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>] group along the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis and the [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] carbonate units are roughly oriented along the [001] direction. Ca polyhedra and disilicate units form corrugated walls parallel to (001) cross-linked by the [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] triangles. Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra of Ca atoms provide reliable information on the number of atoms that must be considered as first neighbors for bonding purposes

 </sup>. There are five Ca sites with three types of coordination: 1 × [CaO
 <sub>6</sub>], 3 × [CaO
 <sub>7</sub>] and 1 × [CaO
 <sub>8</sub>]. Except the octahedron, the other Ca-centered polyhedra are very irregular and difficult to describe. Major distortions likely come from the shortening of edges shared between polyhedra, as expected from electrostatic interactions

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>] groups flex to yield a dihedral angle of 156.86(14)°.
