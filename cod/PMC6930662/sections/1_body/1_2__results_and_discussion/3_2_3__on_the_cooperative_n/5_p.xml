<p>The next feature pointing out the cooperativity of the self-assembly is the shortening of the hydrogen bonds upon stack growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). Such a behavior has been observed in computational studies of smaller BTA-cored molecules [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In contrast to this, the close contacts do not show any clear dependence on the assembly size, and they cannot be considered as one of the descriptors of cooperativity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). As follows from 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04387-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the strength of hydrogen bonding also changes depending on the position inside the stack. Although the values do not give a monotonic dependence, the trend is clearly seen: The shortest hydrogen bonds are found close to the center of the stack. Similar conclusions have been drawn in a computational study by Albuquerque et al. [
