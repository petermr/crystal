<p id="Par18">These data suggest that interlayer strain can affect the magnetism in a substantial manner. In this scenario, the broadened specific heat peak in ‘crystal a’ would result from a 
 <italic>distribution</italic> of local lattice parameters, and thereby a distribution of local interlayer exchange couplings, resulting in a spread of ordering points. However, one difficulty with this argument is that such a distribution would have a larger effect on the temperature width of the transition than the mean transition temperature, since the bulk 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice parameters in crystals ‘a’ and ‘b’ are identical (leaving aside such questions as the temperature dependence of the magnetic correlation length in such a disordered scenario). Furthermore the fact that the strained calculations show larger 
 <italic>decreases</italic> in magnetic order (measured as the interlayer coupling) with compressive strain than 
 <italic>increases</italic> with tensile strain suggests that the effect of a distribution of 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice parameters around the bulk value would be a 
 <italic>decrease</italic> in Néel point, not an increase. If the reverse were true – that the increases in magnetic order with one form of strain were larger than the decreases with the opposite strain – one would in fact have a possible explanation for the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> enhancement. However, the calculations do not suggest this ladder possibility, and thus we must consider, as unsupported the hypothesis, that strain-related interlayer-magnetic exchange differences create the observed 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> increase in ‘crystal a’.
