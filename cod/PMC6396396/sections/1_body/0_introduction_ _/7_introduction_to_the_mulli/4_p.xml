<p>Two studies on mullite applied DFT to investigate the crystal structure and physical properties. Chen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2010
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> ▸</xref>) studied 2 × 2 × 2 superstructures of mullite with vacancy concentrations of 0.125, 0.250 and 0.375. Different vacancy distributions were used and the most stable models, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> the ones with the lowest total free energy, were used for structural investigations. They identified a mechanism for how the presence of vacancies affects the orientation of octahedra. Al/Si ordering was not addressed in the study and seems to be randomly chosen. Aryal 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2012
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> ▸</xref>) studied different superstructures of mullite with vacancy concentrations 0.25, 0.40, 0.67 and 0.81. The structural models were represented graphically and by pair distribution functions, but from the information provided it is difficult to identify a specific vacancy distribution. It seems that crystal chemical constraints like the avoidance of face-sharing tetrahedra were not considered as the study focused mainly on physical properties. In both studies the satellite reflections and superspace symmetry were not considered to support the generation or analysis of structural models.
