<p>Therefore, the clear explanation for the wavelength shift of the emission band maxima in Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) requires reconsideration of the structural aspects of the compounds because the energy levels of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> are perturbed by neighbor cations and anions, such as O
 <sup>2–</sup>, Si
 <sup>4+</sup>, Li
 <sup>+</sup>, and M
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba).

 <sub>4</sub> (or LiO

 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba). For example, if one assumes that the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> activator occupies the Ca1 site in a CaO
 <sub>8</sub> polyhedron, the repulsion between Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Si
 <sup>4+</sup> (or Li
 <sup>+</sup>) is more prominent than that from the neighbor CaO
 <sub>8</sub> polyhedra (×8) with corner-sharing through O atoms because of the difference in the bond distance between Ca–O and Si–O (or Li–O). As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>, a MO
 <sub>

 </sub> polyhedron is connected by SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, LiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, and M’O
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> polyhedra with shared corners, edges, and faces depending on the crystal structure in Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba). According to Pauling’s rule 3, in the only corner-shared polyhedra, the cations (or anions) are away from each other, while the distances between the cations (or anions) are getting shorter from edge-shared to face-shared, which finally results in the more enhanced electron–electron repulsions. Consequently, the energy levels of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> activator stabilized in a MO
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> polyhedron are perturbed and changed depending on the electron–electron repulsions between neighbor anions and Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>.

 </disp-formula>The fact that the emission spectra of Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) (see 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>) show variation of the band maxima (at 480 nm for Ca, 569 nm for Sr, and 509 nm for Ba) warrants that our interpretation of the emission band maxima from Ca to Ba in these compounds is reasonable.

 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) before and after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping. It is evident that the absorption intensities between 250 and 500 nm of Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are greatly increased compared to those of the host lattices of Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, for M = Ca and Sr, the absorption bands of the N
 <sup>3–</sup>-doped compounds are greatly intensified compared to those of Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, probably as a result of the N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, which is in agreement with the PL results (see

 </sup> the valence band of Li

 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) is mainly formed by the O 2p states and the conduction band is predominantly made up of M 5d and Si 3p states. For Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub> host lattices, the band gap energies progressively decrease along with Ca → Ba → Sr because the order of energy levels of M 5d orbitals is Li
