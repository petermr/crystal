<p id="p0230">Thus, the PESs, being, as a rule, dynamic (adiabatic) invariants for the initial and final states of the electron-nuclear system,
 <xref rid="fn8" ref-type="fn">8</xref> are not dynamic invariants for the transient state. Therefore, the problem of finding dynamical invariants for the transient state arises. We will solve this problem in the simplest case of “chemical transformations”: in the case of extended electron-vibrational transitions or, in other words, in the case of elementary electron transfers in condensed matter.
