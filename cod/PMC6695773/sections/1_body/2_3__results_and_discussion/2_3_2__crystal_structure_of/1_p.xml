<p>Two methods were employed to solve the crystal structure of the new phase of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn. The first method for determining the crystal system and space group was based on SAED patterns of TEM. For Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn bulk sample, the phase transformation started at ~310 K from the previous DMA result [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or ~330 K from our thermal expansion measurement result. Thus we can determine the new phase’s crystal structure of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn foil specimen at room temperature (~290 K) by the traditional selected area electron diffraction technique of TEM. By systematically tilting the Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn specimen, a set of SAED patterns were obtained as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The crystal zone axis and experimental tilting angle between the neighboring SAED patterns are noted in the figure. Analyzing the patterns, the reflection conditions could be obtained as: for hkl, h + k = 2n; for 0kl, k = 2n; for h0l, h, l = 2n; for hk0, h + k = 2n; h00, h = 2n; for 0k0, k = 2n; for 00l, l = 2n. Thus, the reflections can be indexed according to a base-centered orthorhombic structure with lattice parameters of a = 6.10 Å, b = 10.45 Å, c = 4.89 Å, and the space group was uniquely determined to be Cmcm (No. 63) according to the International Tables for Crystallography [
