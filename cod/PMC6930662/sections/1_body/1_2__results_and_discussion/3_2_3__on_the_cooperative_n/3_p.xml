<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f005">Figure 5</xref>, we compare the binding energies per pair for azo–star columns of various length from experiments, i.e., for the stack shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f001">Figure 1</xref>e [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (panel a), and modelled in MD simulations (panel b). Both data sets show an obvious 
 <italic>N</italic>-dependence. This behaviour is analogous to results reported earlier [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The interaction strength increases with the number of molecules, proving that the formation of longer columns is energetically increasingly favorable, or in other words cooperative, as compared to shorter associates. On both panels, the binding energy decreases toward an asymptotic value for the infinitely long supramolecule. The values for the stacks with 
 <italic>N</italic> = 20 are comparable to each other with −213 and −296 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> for Lee’s column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f001">Figure 1</xref>e) and stacks from our recent publication [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], respectively. Here, it is important to underline that for such long columns of molecules with an all-atom representation of the star, the self-assembly rules are analyzed for the first time. In previous works, the objects of the simulations were either very short columns, or coarse-grainedd modelled stacks.
