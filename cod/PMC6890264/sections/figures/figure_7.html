 <caption> Schematic depiction of the Cu + for Ga 3+ cation exchange reaction in Cu 2– x S nanocrystals. (a) Free GaCl 3 reacts as a Lewis acid, extracting S 2–, leading to etching of the nanocrystals. (b) Extraction of S 2– is inhibited when GaCl 3 is complexed with a phosphine ligand. (c) Successful cation exchange involves four steps: (i) cleavage of the Ga–P bond at the Cu 2– x S nanocrystal surface, at which point Ga–S and P–Cu bonds are made simultaneously; (ii) extraction of Cu + by the phosphine; (iii) subsequent incorporation of Ga 3+ into the nanocrystal; and (iv) reaction of remaining Cl – with Cu +, extracting two additional Cu + ions, completing the exchange. </caption>
