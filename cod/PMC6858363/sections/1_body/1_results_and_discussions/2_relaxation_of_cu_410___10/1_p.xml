<p id="Par8">To validate the results, we compare the interlayer spacings of the terrace atoms of Cu(410), i.e., atoms along Cu(410)-[100] and their Cu(100) counterpart (cf., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref> lower panel and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To define the first (topmost) interlayer spacing, we took the difference in the average positions of the first group of four atoms, viz., (1, 2, 3, 4) = A layer, and that of the second group of four atoms, viz., (5, 6, 7, 8) = B layer. We did the same for the next two groups of four atoms, viz., C and D layers. The results show A-B contraction, B-C expansion, and no change in C-D (relative to the bulk-truncated (100) interlayer spacing
