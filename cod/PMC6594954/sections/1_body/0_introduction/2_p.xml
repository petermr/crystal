 </sup>. High-pressure can effectively overcome reaction energy barriers and reorder atomic orbital energy levels so that new phases could reveal properties and stoichiometries unexpected from the viewpoint of conventional solid-state chemistry. Pressure-induced densification of matter is accompanied by the rearrangement of atomic bonds and structural units in order to fill the available space as effective as possible, which usually results in the increase of the atomic coordination numbers (see, e.g., reports on five- and six-fold coordination of silicon in glasses and melts
