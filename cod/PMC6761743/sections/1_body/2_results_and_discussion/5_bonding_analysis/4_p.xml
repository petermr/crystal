<p>A comparison of the negative integrated pCOHP values (−IpCOHP) for all inspected sulfides demonstrates that the −IpCOHP values of the heteroatomic M-d–S 3p interactions are larger than those related to the homoatomic M-d–M-d separations (

 </xref>). Because of such broad differences between the −IpCOHP values, the M-d–S 3p interactions have much larger percentage contributions to the net bonding capabilities than the homoatomic M-d–M-d interactions in all sulfides. Accordingly, this outcome suggests that the majority of the bonding interactions occurs between the M–S contacts beside minor, but evident M–M bonding, a circumstance that has also been encountered for certain reduced (divalent) rare-earth-metal halides

 </sup> A comparison between the percentage contributions of the rock salt-type sulfides and the corresponding metal-deficient species reveals that the percentages of the M-d–S 3p interactions are larger in the metal-deficient sulfides than in the respective (parental) non-metal-deficient sulfides. This result indicates that the occupations of antibonding M-d–S 3p states at the Fermi level in a given sulfide are reduced as the number of vacancies in the crystal structure of the respective sulfide increases. Notably, such a tendency has also been observed by previous research on the interdependence between the electronic structures of phase change materials and the presence of vacancies in their crystal structures.
