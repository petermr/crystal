The prospects of their application were shown. To reduce pollution by mining wastes, filters with dried marine alga Saccharina bongardiana in combination with zeolite and pumice are recommended. Sorbents based on Kamchatka aluminosilicates were shown to be effective for the purification of sewage waters of mining factories from heavy metals. Besides cleaning industrial waters, their utilization appeared to be a promising technique for the extraction of non-ferrous metals from natural waters. The method was further modernized with the addition of components derived from marine organisms, in particular, from brown algae

The mutual influence on the kinetics of the sorption of copper (II), nickel (II) and cobalt (II) ions (under their compresence) by natural zeolite of theYagodninsky deposit (Kamchatka) was experimentally investigated. The coefficient of internal diffusion, the rate constant of exchange reaction according to the models of pseudo-first and pseudo-second order were calculated for each ion. The calculated diffusion coefficients
