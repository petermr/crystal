 <italic>
  <bold>x</bold>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>
  <bold>y</bold>
 </italic>, and 
 <italic>
  <bold>z</bold>
 </italic>, are defined along the [100], [010], and [001] directions of NaCl crystals, respectively. The solid–liquid interface is parallel to the 
 <italic>
  <bold>x</bold>
 </italic>–
 <italic>
  <bold>y</bold>
 </italic> plane, i.e., perpendicular to the 
 <italic>
  <bold>z</bold>
 </italic> direction. In the current work, the origin of 
 <italic>
  <bold>z</bold>
 </italic> axis is defined as the position of the outermost crystal layer. The system (57.8 Å × 57.8 Å × 151.2 Å) is composed of NaCl crystal (4000 Na
 <sup>+</sup> and 4000 Cl
 <sup>–</sup>) and NaCl solution (1034 Na
 <sup>+</sup>, 1034 Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, and 9272 water molecules). The concentration of the solution is 6.2 mol/kg, which is the saturation concentration given by the JC model at room temperature (298 K)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
 </sup> and close to the experimental value (6.16 mol/kg at 298.15 K).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
 </sup> The saturation concentration has been thoroughly tested by others

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>
 </sup> and us. In fact, in our simulation of up to tens of nanoseconds, the system does equilibrate at this concentration of room temperature.
