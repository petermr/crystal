<p id="Par4">Several factors were found to affect the amorphization ability of a multilayer system, including the composition of reactants

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, the layer thickness and sequence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, and the state of the precursor
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Traditionally, MGs composition screening of this kind has to go through a series of trial-and-error experiments
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Such an approach is both labour-intensive and time-consuming, so it is not efficient for exploring a wide compositional range.
