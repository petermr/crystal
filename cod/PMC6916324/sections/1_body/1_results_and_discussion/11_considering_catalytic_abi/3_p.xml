<p>When for example, C−C bonds are activated in a substrate by rhodium and nickel catalysts, it is proven that this is a structurally sensitive reaction that takes place on coordinatively unsaturated atom pairs of the d‐metals on corners or edges of minute crystallites.

The layer is chosen such that no covalent bonds are broken in the phosphate and cobalt atoms appear on the surface. The positions of electronically depleted areas found from the multipole refined Laplacians are superimposed onto the surface of the cobalt atoms as black areas. At the (011) face only Co

 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> atoms face each other in pairs, each exposing three and four vacant coordination sites. The pairs at the edges even have up to six vacant coordination sites per Co atom. They are perfectly arranged to serve as adsorption sites for the two oxygen lone pairs of the butanol molecules, which then σ‐bridges two Co atoms.
