<p>A simple model of the reduced anatase surface can be generated by oxygen desorption induced by heating. Although, as the least coordinated, the outermost O

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) has shown that these surface vacancies are unstable and quickly evolve to form subsurface vacancies. We therefore consider a subsurface oxygen vacancy model where an oxygen atom is removed from the second trilayer of the surface (see
