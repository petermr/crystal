<p>Thus, to establish the mechanism of antimalarial action by quinoline drugs, it was imperative to determine the crystal structure of hemozoin. A breakthrough was achieved by Pagola et al. (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) nearly 20 y ago characterizing the crystal structure of synthetic hemozoin (see

 </ext-link>) and so devise a model of quinoline drug binding to the {100}, {001}, and {011} faces, as was proposed by Weissbucht and Leiserowitz (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and Buller et al. (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Later, Kapishnikov and Leiserowitz, in an article by Biot and coworkers (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), provided an improved model of chloroquine-type binding to the hemozoin {100} face, which involves an acidâ€“base interaction between a quinoline molecule and 2 accessible heme propionic acid groups spanning 2 unit cells on the well-expressed {100} face. However, to date, all growth inhibition studies have been done on synthetic hemozoin.
