<p>Thus, when D0
 <sub>19</sub> plane (201) was divided into the doublet of orthorhombic (041) and (221) planes during cooling as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, d-spacing of (041) should increase as lattice parameter b increases and c keeps constant, and d-spacing of (221) should decrease as the reduction of a is larger than the increment of b during cooling, which are consistent with the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f004">Figure 4</xref>c.
