 <sub>6</sub> (1 M) in EC/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 vol, LP30 Sigma-Aldrich) and home-prepared 1 
 <italic>m</italic> LiBOB in EC/PC (1:1 vol) electrolytes were used as electrolyte solutions for the tests carried out in Li cells at RT and 100 °C, respectively. The use of Li cell configurations for the tests aiming to oxidize magnesium ternary nitride phases stems from the impossibility to achieve Mg plating at the counter electrode in the alkyl carbonate-based electrolyte employed. In contrast, the Li and Ca electrolytes used enabled, respectively, Li and Ca metal plating at the counter electrode, thus allowing reliable measurements. Dry (&lt;50 ppm H
 <sub>2</sub>O), 0.3 M magnesium bis trifluoromethane sulphonyl imide (Mg(TFSI)
 <sub>2</sub>, Solvionic, 99.5%) in a 1:1 vol mixture of EC (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and PC (Solvionic, 99.9%) was used as electrolyte for the reduction (magnesiation) tests carried out in Mg cells. Ca metal three-electrode cells and 0.45 M Ca(BF

 <sub>2</sub> in EC/PC (1:1 vol) electrolyte with H
 <sub>2</sub>O content &lt;25 ppm were used for the electrochemical tests on CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>. Galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL) and EPS steps tests were run on a Bio-Logic VMP3 and MPG2 potentiostat/galvanostat. Potential steps of 5 mV and current threshold of C/100 (equivalent to intercalation of 1 mol of divalent ions in 100 h) and C/100 rate were used in the EPS and GCPL tests, respectively. A temperature equilibration of 5 h at the open circuit potential was completed prior to measurements. The active material mass loadings were of about 3–4 mg.
