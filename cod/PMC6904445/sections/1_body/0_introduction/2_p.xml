 </sup>. Because the magnetism and transport properties of these compounds scale with the Mn-O-Mn bond angle, which defines the balance between competitive electronic and magnetic interactions, these materials are highly sensitive to external parameters which can distort the crystallographic structure, like pressure, applied magnetic/electric fields and epitaxial strain

 <sub>3</sub> (hereafter designated by GMO) has attracted much attention with the aim to strain-engineering its properties, as its Mn-O-Mn bond angle sets it at the border line between spontaneous multiferroics TbMnO
 <sub>3</sub> and DyMnO
