  <title>Asymmetric MR of LMO within the

  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Notation of angles for magnetic fields rotated within the three principal planes of the coordinate system specified in 
   <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Normalized ADMR curves obtained at various temperatures as a constant magnetic field of 13 T is rotated within the 
   <italic>ac</italic> plane. The ADMR evolves from symmetric (about the 
   <italic>a</italic> or the 
   <italic>c</italic> axis) at high temperatures to asymmetric at low temperatures. Data are shifted vertically for clarity. Here, current is injected along the 
   <italic>a</italic> axis. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Left panel: Mirror reflection of the ADMR curves at 
   <italic>T</italic> = 37 K [in (A)] about the 
   <italic>c</italic> axis. Right panel: Corresponding reflection plot at 
   <italic>T</italic> = 4.2 K. The shaded region indicates the degree of asymmetry between these two curves. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Evolution of the asymmetric MR with temperature. The solid circles represent the degree of asymmetry in the ADMR, quantified by taking the normalized integrated area inside the red and blue curves in (B) defined as σ ≡ (
   <italic>A</italic>
   <sub>LHS</sub> − 
   <italic>A</italic>
   <sub>RHS</sub>)/(
   <italic>A</italic>
   <sub>LHS</sub> + 
   <italic>A</italic>
   <sub>RHS</sub>). Inset: Blowup of the same figure between 10 and 40 K, to highlight the growth of the asymmetry below 
   <italic>T</italic>
   <sub>min</sub>. The dashed line is a fit to a simple parabolic temperature dependence. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Similar ADMR sweeps as in 
   <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, but for the current along the 
   <italic>b</italic> axis, showing a similar asymmetry at low temperatures. (
   <bold>F</bold>) At a fixed temperature (
   <italic>T</italic> = 1.2 K), the asymmetry in the ADMR grows with increasing field.
