 <sup>2+</sup>-doped samples of SALON exhibit intense red luminescence when excited with UV to green light. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows the excitation spectrum (grey curve) and the emission spectrum (red curve) of a SALON bulk sample. The emission of the single-crystal used for the structure determination has also been measured and is very similar to the emission of the powder (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Therefore, the luminescence properties of the bulk sample can clearly be associated with SALON. This also rules out the possibility that SrO, which is present as a side phase in the bulk sample of SALON and can also exhibit a red emission when doped with Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, contributes to the observed emission spectra

 </sup>), a very good red phosphor which has received significant attention, the main advantage of SALON lies in the position of its emission maximum, which is located at higher energies than the emission maximum of SLA and thereby significantly increases the emission’s overlap with the human eye sensitivity curve (dotted black curve in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The optimized spectral position of the SALON phosphor leads to an LER increase by a factor of roughly 3.5 compared to Sr[LiAl

 </sup> regarding full-conversion red-emitting pc-LEDs built up from a primary blue LED and one single red-emitting phosphor. The relative blue shift of SALON’s emission maximum is caused by a less pronounced nephelauxetic effect and a lower crystal field splitting due to the presence of oxygen atoms in the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-coordination sphere (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), whereas only nitrogen atoms are present in the case of Sr[LiAl

 <sup>2+</sup>. In addition to the well suited spectral position of SALON for red components in high-performance white LEDs, its small FWHM of 48 nm makes a huge step on the way towards the goal of reducing the FWHM of red phosphors to strongly increase the LED’s overall efficacy
