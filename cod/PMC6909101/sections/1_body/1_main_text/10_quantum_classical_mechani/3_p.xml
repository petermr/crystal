<p id="p0710">Mesoscopic physics is a phenomenological approach, that is, such an approach when we build 
 <italic>ad hoc</italic> models to account for quantum effects in macroscopic and classical systems. For example, when we consider dimensional quantization (quantum confinement) in nanoparticles, or when we introduce quantization of classical chaos, we obtain quantum chaos. Various examples of mesoscopic physics problems can be found, for example, in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], and, in particular, on quantum chaos and its connection with mesoscopic physics, for example, in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>].
