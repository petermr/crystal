<p>To assess the behavior of the dynamical stability of GeSe under pressure, the full phonon spectrum at different applied pressures up to 50 GPa was calculated using first principle calculations. The phonon dispersion curves along the high-symmetry path and the phonon density of states (PDOS) of GeSe at atmospheric pressure are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f007">Figure 7</xref>a. No imaginary frequency is found, implying that the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> structure of GeSe at atmospheric pressure is dynamically stable. As mentioned above, the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> symmetry changes to higher 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> symmetry when the pressure reaches 34 GPa. However, the imaginary frequency of the acoustic branch appears in the phonon dispersion relationships at 34 GPa. Moreover, the imaginary frequency is located at the Î“ point, not at other high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. The magnitude of the imaginary frequency decreases as soon as the pressure increases. The imaginary frequency disappears entirely when the simulated external pressure reaches 37 GPa, as seen in
