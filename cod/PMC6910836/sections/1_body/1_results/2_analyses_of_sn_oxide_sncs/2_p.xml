<p>The oxidation states of the Sn atoms in the SNCs were evaluated by Sn 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> core-level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In each case, a significant contribution of a shoulder peak on the lower binding energy edge was apparent (fig. S5), indicating the formation of substoichiometric SnO

 <sup>2+</sup> in the materials in the present study was slightly higher than that obtained in a previous study in which Sn oxide SNCs were calcined at 600°C on mesoporous silica substrates (
