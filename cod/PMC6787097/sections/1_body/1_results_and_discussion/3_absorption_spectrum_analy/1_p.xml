 <sup>3+</sup>. At x = 0, the absorption spectra show a strong absorption band around 232 nm. When the Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are incorporated into the host lattice, the absorption spectra show a slight red-shift, which indicates that the Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are doped successfully into the host lattice, and it is consistent with the XRD results. The cause of the red-shift was already reported by Ahemen·I 
 <italic>et al</italic>. The red-shift of absorption spectra is mainly attributed to the electro-negativity difference between Natrium and Terbium. Since, the electro-negativity of Terbium is higher than that of Natrium (Pauling electro-negativity of Terbium is 1.1 and that of Natrium is 0.98), and thus the electro-negativity difference between Na and O is larger than that of Tb and O. In our case, the introduction of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> may lower the O
 <sup>2−</sup> ligand to cations bond energy in comparison with that of pristine sample
