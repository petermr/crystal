<p id="Par13">We examined possible mechanisms that explain the function of YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in PLQE enhancement. Previous study showed organic ligands of layered perovskites have strong impact on the electron–phonon interaction and thus on PLQE of perovskites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. To find out possible impact of Y incorporation on the electron–phonon interaction, we studied the temperature-dependent PL full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>(1:1) films with or without YCl
 <sub>3</sub>, which is a well-established method to derive an electron–phonon interaction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>, the PL FWHMs of samples with and without YCl
 <sub>3</sub> show the same trend at varied temperatures, which indicates that YCl
 <sub>3</sub> does not notably change charge–phonon interaction strength. We did notice that addition of YCl
 <sub>3</sub> reduced FWHM of PL spectra at all temperatures. This result implies YCl
 <sub>3</sub> can reduce the nonradiative recombination centers in PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>(1:1) films
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, which is confirmed by more than two times longer PL decay lifetime after adding YCl
 <sub>3</sub>, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>. Simulation was performed in CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite incorporated with YCl
 <sub>3</sub> to find out why Y
 <sup>3+</sup> ions reduce nonradiative charge recombination. Based on the model, the way of Y
 <sup>3+</sup> incorporation in CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> is most likely by replacing Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> and simultaneously forming a Cs
 <sup>+</sup> vacancy to compensate the charge difference. As shown in Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>, density function theory calculation reveals Y
 <sup>3+</sup> incorporation increases the bandgap of perovskite, as Y 4
 <italic>d</italic> level is well above the Pb 6
 <italic>p</italic> states and the Cl 3
 <italic>p</italic> states are slightly lower than Br 3
 <italic>p</italic> states. Therefore, the yttrium incorporated region at the shell of the grains impose an energy barrier, which confines charge carriers inside the grains, as is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. This charge confinement minimizes nonradiative recombination that generally occurs at grain boundaries and surfaces due to local large density of defects.
