 <caption> Snapshot of the configurations in the plane xy of a system of N = 2 × 10 3 particles interacting with the GEM-3 potential for both ABP (left column) and AOUP (right column) active forces. Panels (a) and (b) are obtained with U 0 = 2.75, panels (c) and (d) with U 0 = 3.75 and panels (e) and (f) with U 0 = 4.5. Other parameters: γ = 1, D r  = 1, L = 1, R = 10 −1, ε = 1, T = 10 −4 U 0 2/ D r γ. In the AOUP case the parameters used are D r  = 1/ τ and U 0 2 = 2 D a / τ. Black lines in panels (a) and (b) are eye-guides to show the hexagonal pattern. Graphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) display an inset around a small square region around a cluster. In the insets, the black arrows have a length proportional to the active force on each particle. In panel (d), isolated particles not belonging to clusters are highlighted by red circles. </caption>
