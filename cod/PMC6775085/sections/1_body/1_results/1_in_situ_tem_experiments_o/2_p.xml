<p id="Par7">To verify the proposed method above, we conducted experiments by mounting a metal foil onto a miniaturized heater at the front end of the TEM holder (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The opposite side is a movable diamond tip or tungsten tip as the cold end to realize the drawing operation. At drawing speed &lt;10 nm s
