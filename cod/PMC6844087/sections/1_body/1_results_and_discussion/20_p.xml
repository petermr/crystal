<p>Once the first conditions were tested, this work focused its attention on a more detailed study of a smaller region around the optimum (previously represented in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>B). By considering that there are no significant differences in the size of the formed nanoparticles, the region where higher purities have been achieved is zoomed. The new conditions are described in
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>. XRD results of this second batch of samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure
