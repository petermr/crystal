<p>The disproportionately widening in 
 <italic>a</italic> is associated with a change in the hydrogen bonding system. The distances O−H⋅⋅⋅O are 274 and 282 pm at 100 K, but 307 and 290 pm at 370 K (Figure 
 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the high‐temperature form, the mirror plane runs through the center of the hydrogen bond, i. e. the hydrogen atom is in a symmetric double‐minimum potential and can be alternately attached to one of the two involved oxygen atoms. As the hydrogen bonds form chains along [100], the actual position of one hydrogen atom will influence all others along [100]. Such a correlated hydrogen shift resembles the Grotthuss mechanism in proton conductors.
