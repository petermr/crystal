<p>It is known that the Stern-Volmer relationship describes the dependence of fluorescence response to the concentration of quencher, as 
 <italic>S</italic> = 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>/
 <italic>F</italic>= 1+
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>q</sub>
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> [Q]. Here, 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>q</sub> is the quencher rate coefficient and 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the lifetime of the emissive excited state without a quencher present. [Q] is the concentration of the quencher Q. Therefore, 
 <italic>S</italic> is of linear dependence with [Q] provided that 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>q</sub> and 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> are constants. The Stern-Volmer relationship is established based on a model involving double molecules. However, the intermolecular deactivation differs from the present detection, where several individual heavy metal ions interact with a QD assembled by a matrix of super cells. Therefore, the results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f007">Figure 7</xref> deviate from the linear correlation and the sensing mechanism needs further discussions.
