 <xref rid="B113-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The first dehydrogenation steps are the decomposition of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> to Al and LiH. Then its dehydrogenation products react with LiNH
 <sub>2</sub>. Here, less consensus can be found (compared to the previous examples of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> composites), and several reactions, mechanisms, and intermediaries have been proposed, for example:
