<p>According to the computation of the elastic constant tensor at 15 GPa (Table 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the bulk modulus defined as an average between Voigt and Reuss calculations is 209.21 GPa, self‐consistent with the value deduced from the EOS. The shear modulus is 119.7 GPa.
