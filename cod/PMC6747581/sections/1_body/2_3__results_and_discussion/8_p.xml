 <xref rid="materials-12-02667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we observed five IR-active modes in infrared spectra calculation [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our calculated IR-active modes confirm the existence of two A
 <sub>2u</sub> mode with frequencies of 
 <sup>1</sup>A
 <sub>2u</sub> = 18 (27 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) and 
 <sup>2</sup>A
 <sub>2u</sub> = 170 (175 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), along with three E
 <sub>u</sub> mode with frequencies of 
 <sup>1</sup>E
 <sub>u</sub> = 34 (44 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), 
 <sup>2</sup>E
 <sub>u</sub> = 78(88 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) and 
 <sup>3</sup>E
 <sub>u</sub> = 188(192 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we presented our calculated values for R-active and IR-active modes along with results published earlier in [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the experimental values [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Note that our calculated R-active and IR-active modes are in better agreement with the experimental results obtained in [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] than [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the calculated phonon frequencies of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> are lower than the corresponding experimental phonon frequencies. The exchange correlation functional used in this study is not enough to estimate the transition pressure. On the other hand, it is very difficult to obtain a pure form of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> at ambient conditions due to experimental limitations and metastability.
