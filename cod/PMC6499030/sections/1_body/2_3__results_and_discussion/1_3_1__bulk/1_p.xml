<p>The anatase structure belongs to the I4
 <sub>1</sub>/amd tetragonal space group and the unit cell is defined by the lengths of lattice vectors a and c and the oxygen internal coordinate u. The primitive cell contains two atoms in the asymmetric unit: a Ti ion at (0,0,0) and an O ion at (0,0,u), in fractional coordinates. Anatase is an indirect band-gap semiconductor with an optical band gap of approximately 3.2 eV (measured by using UV adsorption spectroscopy) (Reddy et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Anatase bulk lattice parameters have been relaxed with AE–LCAO and the DFT functionals: PBE, PBE0, B3LYP, HSE and HSED3. The computed structures and eigenvalue gaps (here, referred to as band gaps for convenience) are presented in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and compared to the structure deduced from X-ray diffraction and the optical band gap measured using UV adsorption spectroscopy (Reddy et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). It is clear from 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> that the best agreement, for both lattice parameters and band gap, is obtained with the HSE functional. The results obtained within the HSED3 approach are also reported in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, showing no significant changes with respect to pure HSE. The B3LYP lattice parameters and band gap are very similar to the ones previously obtained in the literature (Labat et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sanches et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The eigenvalue gap is an estimate of the fundamental band gap. When using HSE and HSED3, the 13% overestimation of the optical band gap is not unreasonable as the optical gap is expected to be less than the fundamental gap due to the exciton binding energy. A comparison of the DOS calculated with PP–PW (PBE and PBE+U) and AE–LCAO (PBE, B3LYP and HSE) is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. All DOS reported are plotted relative to the CBM to aid comparison. It is important to highlight the good agreement between AE–LCAO and PP–PW approaches with the same functional (PBE). Both methods provide a very similar band gap and lattice parameters suggesting that the PP–PW and local basis set approaches provide a very similar description of the electronic structure in both the valence and conduction bands. The projected density of states (DOS) for bulk anatase performed with AE–LCAO (HSE) shows that the conduction band is largely made up of Ti 3d orbitals and the upper valence band of O 2p orbitals, as one expects from a simple ionic model of the bonding.
