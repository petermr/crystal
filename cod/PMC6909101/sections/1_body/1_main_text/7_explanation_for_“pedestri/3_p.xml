<p id="p0640">Initially, consider the first option. In the course of the electron transition, for example, from the ground state, where the probability of finding the electron is greatest in the middle of the box, to the first excited state, where this probability becomes larger both near the stationary and movable walls, the electron pressure on the walls arises. This pressure sets the free wall in motion. Due to the very rapid motion of the free wall, the width of the potential box increases very rapidly and unlimitedly. As a result, the energy level of the excited state falls very rapidly straight down to coincidence with the energy level of the ground state; this obviously leads to a singularity (to infinity) in the quantum transition rate [
