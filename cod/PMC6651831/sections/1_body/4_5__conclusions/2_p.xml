<p>The variance in the maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values for both the layered and fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites was investigated with respect to the possible anisotropic properties of component phase. The results showed that by enhancing the anisotropic profile of polycrystal, the maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> for both the layered and fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites can be improved. For the SnSe/Copper composite at 700 K, the improvement of maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values for the composite with anisotropic SnSe single-crystal components can be as much as 51% compared to the composites with isotropic SnSe polycrystals.
