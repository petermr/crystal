<p>The total DOS given in

 </xref>a for the paraelectric phase shows a metallic behavior for all magnetic configurations. From the total DOS of the ferroelectric phase (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>
 </xref>b), it can be seen that the nonmagnetic phase shows a metallic state, whereas the ferromagnetic case is a half metal with a gap of ∼0.5 eV in the down-spin channel. But when the antiferromagnetic ordering is introduced, the exchange potential produced by the exchange interaction pushes the V 3d states toward the lower-energy side, which results in an insulating state with a narrow gap. So, a combination of spin polarization, magnetic ordering, and crystal structure plays important roles in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of PVO. The broad band spreading from −7 to −2 eV is mainly due to the strong hybridization between V 3d and O 2p electrons. The localized states at around −9 eV are generated from the hybridized Pb 6s lone pair electrons. After including the correlation effect through the Hubbard 
 <italic>U</italic> into the Hamiltonian matrix, the states get more localized to give a larger band gap, and this localization of the d electrons produces a larger magnetic moment.
