<p>Sulfate (SO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2â€“</sup>) has two under-coordinated oxygen atoms; thus this oxyanion can compete with water molecules for the under-coordinated lithium binding sites at the zabuyelite surface. Due to its shape, more than one sulfate O atom can form an interaction with the Li atoms at the zabuyelite surface, i.e., as either monodentate mononuclear (MM) or bidentate binuclear (BB) adsorption complexes. The time scale of the simulations does not allow us to test what happens when sulfate approaches the surface and displaces the water molecules. Therefore, we have compared the energies generated through adsorption of sulfate and water in vacuo to determine if sulfate adsorption is more favorable than water and thus will displace water during adsorption. On all three surfaces, the distance between Li atoms at the surface is favorable for sulfate complex formation. Monodentate mononuclear adsorption complexes were found to be less energetically favorable compare to BB adsorption consistent with previous work.
