<p>Some minor deviations were observed between the mathematical model and the finite element simulation model. This was because the mathematical model assumes a one-dimensional flux flow, i.e., the electrical and heat flux only flow along the applied field, whereas fluxes in other directions are not considered. These fluxes are caused by the material inhomogeneity and the shape feature of fibers. When the fiber volume fraction is very small or very large, homogeneity of the composite will inevitably be compromised. Moreover, when the direction of the applied potential is not perpendicular to the interface between the matrix and fibrous phase, the secondary dimensional flux will occur. Both situations above are the cause of deviation between the mathematical model and finite element simulation results.</p>
