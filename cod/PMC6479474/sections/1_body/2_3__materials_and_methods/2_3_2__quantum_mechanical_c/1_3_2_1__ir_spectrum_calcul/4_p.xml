<p>The best fit was achieved with the scaling parameter

 <sup>−5</sup> (in the 4000–2500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region) and 1.6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> (in the 2500–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region). This scheme resembles the Wavenumber Linear Scaling (WLS), as developed by Yoshida et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] Adjustments were necessary to fit the need of the study in a crystalline state. The calculated NIR spectra were scaled accordingly, while using scale factor 
 <italic>s</italic> equal to 5.1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> (Equation (1)). NIR scaling was significantly lesser; this is reasonable as the anharmonicity of the corresponding vibrations was already accounted for in the calculations. This is further explained in detail elsewhere (refer to Results and Discussion Section).
