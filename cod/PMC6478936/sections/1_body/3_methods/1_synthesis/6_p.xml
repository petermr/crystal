<p id="Par28">The rather long sintering times in the aforementioned synthesis routes result from the fact that SALON decomposes at temperatures only slightly higher than the temperature needed for its synthesis. The synthesis of a phase pure product is therefore always a subtle balance between the speed at which SALON is formed and the starting decomposition of the already formed product. The two synthesis routes described above have been optimized for the growth of single-crystals and the luminescence properties of the product, respectively.</p>
