<p>Furthermore, to theoretically study the impact of multi-frequency vibration on the surface topography, He et al. proposed an analytical model for the surface topography considering the influence of multi-frequency vibration, and subsequently performed the corresponding cutting experiments to validate its accuracy [

The theoretical results coupled with the experimental observations all demonstrated that the bulge segments on the multi-frequency condition are complex and irregular, which is rather different from the mono-frequency vibration condition. Their theoretical results agree well with the experimental results on the studies of multi-frequency vibration as depicted in

They reported that the low-frequency vibration influences the surface roughness error, while the high-frequency vibration affects the figure error in fly-cutting process. Furthermore, Gao et al. pointed out that the fluctuation of the oil source pressure and the flow status of the film of the aerostatic spindle will also affect the figure error in fly-cutting process [
