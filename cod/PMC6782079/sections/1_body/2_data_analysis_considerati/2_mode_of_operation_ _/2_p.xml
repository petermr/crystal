<p>At POWGEN, when the choppers are rotating at 60 Hz, the wavelength (λ) band available is ∼1 Å. The incident flux on the sample as a function of λ is shown in Fig. 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref> across the extended λ range (0–6 Å). The instrument can be operated to provide the full bandwidth at reduced effective power, any 1 Å bandwidth at full power or an intermediate combination. The interchangeable guides offer the option of collecting data in high-resolution or high-intensity mode. Despite the presence of the

 <sub>0</sub> chopper, we observe a very small signal from the prompt pulse, as can be seen at long wavelengths at 1 Å intervals in Fig. 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref>. Approximately 50 µs of data are removed from the beginning of each 60 Hz frame before the data are time focused. As a result, although this instrument can operate at any λ region using the disc choppers, because of the need to calibrate the instrument in each configuration we have chosen several specific λ bands for standard operation. These pre-calibrated settings allow smooth operation of the beamline and offer the data range needed for most crystallographic problems. This also enables users to use all their beamtime to only collect data on their samples. Table 1
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref> shows these standard settings of wavelengths and the 
 <italic>d</italic> and 
 <italic>Q</italic> ranges obtained from them. It should be noted that the modes lower than 60 Hz are rarely used owing to the associated loss of intensity and the fact that the 60 Hz operation is sufficient for most crystallographic experiments. Also, very few standard samples have reflections for the frame with λ centered at 4.797 Å to allow profile parameters to be easily verified.
