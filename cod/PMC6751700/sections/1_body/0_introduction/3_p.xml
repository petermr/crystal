<p>In recent years, all-inorganic perovskite semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) of the form CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> (X = Cl, Br, I) have shown great development, triggered by a report from Protesescu et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 </sup> The PL wavelength of these NCs can be tuned in the visible region between 410 and 700 nm by changing the halide composition, and smaller FWHMs of the PL peak with excellent PL quantum yields (PLQYs) of 50–90% have been observed.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
 </sup> Moreover, to obtain these high PLQYs, core/shell structures, such as CdSe/ZnS QDs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
 </sup> and InP/ZnS QDs,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
 </sup> were not needed. The outstanding PL properties of CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> NCs have attracted much attention;
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
