 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. In the negative 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime, the Fermi level goes down and becomes flat after the channel is pinched-off. Hence there are two regions in negative 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime: accumulation and depletion. The density of occupied states is high in the accumulation region and low in the depletion region, resulting in the current being controlled by the low mobility region i.e. the tail of the GDOS. In the positive 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime, as there is no depletion region, the Fermi level across the entire channel remains near the center of the GDOS and the current is governed by the high mobility region (see Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> in Supplementary Information). This would explain the band-like transport with higher mobilities in positive 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime in pentacene thin film based OFETs. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> schematically illustrates the charge transport, governed by two different sections of the GDOS. When the Fermi level lies near the tail of the GDOS, transport is described by thermally activated hopping. As the Fermi level moves towards the central region, band-like transport becomes possible. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the mobilities obtained in two-terminal and three-terminal devices. we observe that mobilities in two-terminal devices are lower by several orders of magnitude than those obtained in three-terminal devices. This large difference in mobilities in different device configuration is attributed to the anisotropy in the coupling between the dimers along different axis.
