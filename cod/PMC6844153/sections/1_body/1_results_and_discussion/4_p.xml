<p>The dispersion energy does not change the band gap transition trend in V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>, although it is significant in 2D MoS
 <sub>2</sub>. The reason is that such 1D materials have remarkably different conduction bands than the bulk material. With MoS
 <sub>2</sub>, the 2D and 3D structures have a similar band structure to that of bulk MoS
 <sub>2</sub>. The dispersion energy changes the size of the indirect and direct band gaps, while the positions of the band gaps are maintained. However, 1D few-chain V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> have significantly different band structures compared to those of 3D bulk structures. Unlike 2D TMDC, the effect of dispersion energy in these 1D material changes the positions of the indirect and direct band gaps. We expect that there would be bundles of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> whose band structures have intermediate shape between that of a single chain and that of the bulk material, with the number of chains in these bundles more than seven.
