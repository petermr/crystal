<p>The increase of dimensionality of the recording scheme effectively counteracts the dramatic drop in photoemission cross sections and the increase of electron–phonon scattering with increasing photon energy in the several-keV range. The bottleneck for the performance of a HARPES experiment is the parallel accessible
