<p>The 5.970 keV pattern, Fig. 8(

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>, shows pronounced dark straight lines with sixfold symmetry but different from Fig. 8(
 <italic>b</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>. These straight lines could be 
 <italic>Kikuchi lines</italic>, originating from Bragg reflection at lattice planes tilted against the surface normal (Fedchenko 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb21"> ▸</xref>). Most features, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the leaf-shaped dark regions in (
 <italic>a</italic>), the filigree-like central regions in (
 <italic>d</italic>)–(
 <italic>f</italic>), with small spots and circles do not directly fit to a Kikuchi-band pattern. This rich structure appears because the Kikuchi patterns of heavy materials like rhenium are strongly distorted due to the large scattering factor of high-
 <italic>Z</italic> elements. Distortions are strongest in regions where several Kikuchi bands cross each other, like the central region in Figs. 8(
 <italic>a</italic>)–8(
 <italic>f</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>. Since the kinetic energy varies strongly, there is a slight systematic change in the field of view due to the imaging characteristics of the objective lens. The energy dependence of this effect is precisely known and the images have been calibrated to equal 
 <italic>k</italic>-scales.
