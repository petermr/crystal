<p>The transition in size from bulk to clusters of a few atoms is really about the relationship of the surface atoms as compared to bulk atoms. Properties such as catalytic chemistry, surface plasmon resonance, and optical quantum dot photoluminescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] are affected by the coordination and number of surface atoms. The dispersion or relative percentage of surface atoms is determined by the ratio of surface atoms to the total number of atoms, as has been considered previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our analysis will determine the relative ranking of the dispersion in terms of cluster geometry.
