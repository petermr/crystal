 <p>In this study, green-emitting nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDots) were synthesized and incorporated into drop-cast composite films for use as color conversion layers in a white-LED configuration to generate white light. In order to resolve the red deficiency of this configuration, a commercial red phosphor was integrated into the system. Moreover, the N-CDots were also processed into polymer/N-CDot composite fibers, for which we determined the amount of N-CDots that yielded adequate white-light properties. Finally, we showed that white light with excellent properties could be generated by employing both of the fabricated N-CDot composites either as drop-cast films or composite fibers. Hence, N-CDots provide a promising alternative to inorganic phosphors that are commonly employed in white-LED configurations.</p>
