 <p id="Par1">We report synchrotron-based 
  <italic>operando</italic> soft X-ray microscopic photoelectron spectroscopy under charge-discharge control of single crystalline LiCoO
  <sub>2</sub> (LCO) particles as an active electrode material for an all solid-state lithium-ion battery (LIB). Photoelectron mapping and the photoelectron spectrum of a selected microscopic region are obtained by a customized 
  <italic>operando</italic> cell for LIBs. During the charge process, a more effective Li extraction from a side facet of the single crystalline LCO particle than from the central part is observed, which ensures the reliability of the system as an 
  <italic>operando</italic> microscopic photoelectron analyzer that can track changes in the electronic structure of a selected part of the active particle. Based on these assessments, the no drastic change in the Co 2
  <italic>p</italic> XPS spectra during charge-discharge of LCO supports that the charge-polarization may occur at the oxygen side by strong hybridization between Co 3
  <italic>d</italic> and O 2
  <italic>p</italic> orbitals. The success of tracking the electronic-structure change at each facet of a single crystalline electrode material during charge-discharge is a major step toward the fabrication of innovative active electrode materials for LIBs.
