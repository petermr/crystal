<p>A rise in the annealing temperature result in a slight reduction in the oxygen content in nanoparticles structure and an increase in the iron content, which indicates the formation of new phases as an outcome of heat treatment. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the dependences of the change in the Î¶-potentials of nanoparticles before and after thermal annealing in media with diverse pH.
