<p>In order to characterize the phase transformation directly, in-situ XRD experiments of both bulk Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn sample and Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn ultrafine powder were carried out during cooling process. It is true that the crystal structure of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn at 320 K is ordered as a hexagonal D0
 <sub>19</sub> structure with the lattice parameters as shown in [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, entirely different XRD patterns of two kinds of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn samples have been obtained during cooling process from 320 K down to 93 K. For bulk Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f002">Figure 2</xref>a reveals no shape changes of hexagonal D0
 <sub>19</sub> structural diffraction peaks (002), (201), and (203), and the peak positions are almost the same. While for Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn powder, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f002">Figure 2</xref>b reveals that D0
 <sub>19</sub> (002) peak at about 37.8° at 320 K moves toward high diffraction angle direction gradually during cooling and changes to be at about 37.9° at 93 K; D0
 <sub>19</sub> (201) peak around 39.9° at 320 K splits to two new peaks at 39.5° and 40.3° at 93 K; D0
 <sub>19</sub> (203) peak at 69.6° at 320 K also splits into two new peaks at 69.4° and 70.1° respectively at 93 K during cooling process. It is known that diffraction peaks splitting and new peaks appearing are the proofs of symmetry-breaking phase transformation. As a result, we present the direct evidence of solid state phase transformation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn. By comparison, the XRD peaks of bulk Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn sample (with grain size of about 400 µm) are quite wider than that of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn ultrafine powders (with particle size of ~50 µm as measured by SEM). The abnormal broadening of XRD peaks of bulk Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn was not fully understood, and it was speculated to be mainly caused by strain/stress generated from the overlapping nano-twins [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f003">Figure 3</xref>, there are a mass of nano-twins in bulk Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn in the form of stepped twins, lamellar twins and polygon twins, the overlap and intersection of which would probably cause large strain or stress within the grain and result in XRD peak broadening. In addition, it is noted that the D0
 <sub>19</sub> (201) peak existed during the cooling process till 93 K (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, middle subfigure), the area of which decreased gradually along with the area increases of two new phase’s peaks during cooling. Thus, it is indicated that phase transformation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn kept going during 310–93 K cooling process and did not complete leaving with a certain amount of hexagonal parent phase at 93 K. Such on-going phase transformation during cooling might be related to the continuously high damping (Q
 <sup>−1</sup> ≈ 0.2) of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn below 300 K, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f004">Figure 4</xref>a in [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
