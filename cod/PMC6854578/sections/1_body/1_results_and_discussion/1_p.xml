 </xref>. Large density oscillations and layerlike structure are observed near the interface, which is universal in SLI systems. According to the density distribution of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, at least three layers can be identified. For the convenience of the following discussion, we assume that the first layer refers to the one closest to the crystal surface and next is the second and third layer in turn. In the first layer, the number of Na
 <sup>+</sup> is obviously more than that of Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, which is consistent with previous work.

 </sup> Na
 <sup>+</sup> is easier to be adsorbed on crystal surface by replacing water molecules than Cl
 <sup>–</sup>.
