<p id="Par20">In the cycling test work, specific capacitance of α-Co(OH)

 <sup>−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). This unsatisfactory phenomenon may be caused by the strain induced due to the anions breaking away from the interlayer, which leads to the collapse of the structure. In order to further verify hypothesis, morphology of the electrode material was tested after 7200 cycles of charge/discharge and the structure of the nanowires have been transformed to compacted bulk (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In order to better understand the change of two-dimensional layered structure of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> in charging and discharging process, The diagram is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>. Encouragingly, the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction complexes achieve an outstanding cycle stability after 10000 cycles at 5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> and a capacitance retention was up to 123.6%. An improvement of capacitance for hybrid material can be regard as activation of the active sites. This stable structure can be attributed to the mutual-support deformation stress between the layered structures of α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> effectively organized a stable heterojunction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The morphology of the heterojunction after 10000 cycles is further analyzed by SEM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), demonstrating well initial structure of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction material, which confirm the above conclusion. In addition, the heterojunction also delivers a high coulombic efficiency of 85.3%. The illustration diagram in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> shows excellent performance which could be attributed to the synergistic complementarity of the microstructure in two aspects. Firstly, it realizes high concentration ion transport within interlaminar structures and rapid electron transport of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. Besides, fast transport channels by α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction and Ni foam of 3D conductive network are constructed with large numbers of ions contacting with electrode materials.
