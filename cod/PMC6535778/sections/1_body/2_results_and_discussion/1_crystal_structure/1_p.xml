<p>The single crystals of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> are hexagonal plates, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>A, with the rhombohedral 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis perpendicular to the plates (thus the plates are (001) or “basal” planes). The results from single crystal X-ray diffraction reveal that EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> crystallizes in a rhombohedral lattice with the space group 
 <italic>R</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic>, in analogy to Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub>, which is a well-known topological insulator. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>B, each Eu atom, surrounded by six P atoms, forms a trigonal prism. The Eu layers are separated by two Sn@P
 <sub>3</sub> triangular pyramid layers connected by weak Sn–Sn bonds. An inversion center exists in the center of the unit cell. The layered features of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, and its in-plane and honeycomb Sn structure viewed along 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>C,D, respectively. The crystallographic data, including atomic positions, site occupancies, and equivalent isotropic thermal displacement parameters, are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Tables 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>. The refined anisotropic displacement parameters are shown in
