<p>The dual function of having hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors transforms DHB into an even more efficient “traffic hub” than CNA. In the PROG-DHB asymmetric unit, PROG and DHB are combined via the hetero-synthon III, designated an

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The closed rings are connected in an orderly fashion via the DHB molecule and this drives the PROG-DHB to adopt a 3D geometry structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). The DHB benzene ring is almost planar and its angular mean deviation is 0.0116 Å. Moreover, the carboxyl group is also arranged in a planar configuration with a dihedral angle relative to the benzene ring plane of 0.520°. This shows that the carboxyl group and the benzene ring are perfectly conjugated with each other. The remaining hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carbonyl group form an intramolecular hydrogen bond with an O···O distance of 2.612 Å. In addition, DHB acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor and it connects to the adjacent PROG molecular layer via a C-H···O interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). Further C-H···π interactions are also observed between the two components in the PROG-DHB co-crystal and in particular between the carbon atom and the centroid of the six-member ring (Cg) of DHB. These interactions, with a distance of 3.824 and 3.975 Å (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-03936-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), further stabilize the solid structure of the co-crystal. As in the case of PROG-CNA, the α···π interactions strengthen the stability of the PROG-DHB co-crystal.
