<p>The N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms of the materials (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) showed the existence of a type II isotherm, according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and H3 hysteresis, characteristic of materials with slit-shaped and large pores [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The surface area, found by using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), decreased as the synthesis temperature increased. This trend is consistent with the crystal growth–smoothness relation, as evidenced by XRD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and SEM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The mesopore size distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) showed peaks centered at around 399.3 and 414.7 Å for Mn4 and Mn8, respectively, with a pore volume that decreased as the synthesis temperature increased. This observation is in accordance with the aggregate size increment of the birnessite particles. All materials showed microporosity, as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f004">Figure 4</xref>c, and the data show that the microporosity changes with increasing synthesis temperature. The interaction energy of the porous solid surface with the N
 <sub>2</sub>, obtained by nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], varied with the synthesis temperature for the birnessite-type material. The data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f004">Figure 4</xref>d show values for the interaction energy around 48, 56, 60, 72, and 100 K, with a greater contribution at 72 K for the Mn4 material. The main contribution for Mn8 occurred at 28 K followed by interaction energies of 38, 70, and 100 K. Maddox et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that in mesoporous materials, like MCM41, values below 75 K correspond to the usual range of values reported for O–N
 <sub>2</sub> interactions. Values between 125 and 75 K correspond to theoretical εsf/k values for the O–O interaction [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, the information presented asserts that the surfaces of the birnessite-type material are energetically heterogeneous, which probably contributes, in a positive manner, to its electrical processes.
