<p>In compliance with the TEM images, the presence of amorphous regions in the structure of the initial particles indicates the formation of X-ray amorphous phase characteristic of iron oxide. In the case of heat treatment, there is a drop in amorphous and disordered inclusions in the structure of particles, as well as an alteration in their shape from hexagonal to spherical.</p>
