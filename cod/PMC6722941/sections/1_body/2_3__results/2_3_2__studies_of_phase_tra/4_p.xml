<p>According to the data presented in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, it is evident that the main phase transformations occur at a temperature of 600 °C when the formation of the orthorhombic phase CeFeO
 <sub>3</sub> and the rhombic phase of hematite is observed in the structure of nanoparticles. In this case, there is a narrowing of diffraction peaks and an increase in intensity, which indicates amelioration in the structure of the crystals and a drop in amorphous inclusions. The emergence in the structure of nanoparticles of peaks characteristic of the rhombic phase of the hematite Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> at an annealing temperature of 600 °C is due to the fact that according to the phase transition diagram, the transition from the magnetite phase to hematite occurs in the vicinity of 500–600 °C. Therefore, it can be assumed that the formed X-ray amorphous phase of magnetite during the synthesis process, during thermal annealing, is transformed into the hematite phase with its subsequent crystallization. Moreover, the presence of the orthorhombic phase CeFeO
 <sub>3</sub> may be due to the onset of crystallization of the hematite phase with a high content of cerium in the structure of the crystal lattice, or crystallization and replacement of cerium atoms in the lattice sites by iron heating as a result of thermal heating. The formation of the magnetic phase of hematite in nanoparticles structure at a temperature of 600 °C is consistent with previous experiments and the literature data on the phase transformations of iron-based oxide nanoparticles [
