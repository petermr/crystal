<p>In this study we combine the superspace approach with first-principles calculations to establish superspace models from commensurate superstructures which increases significantly the amount of structural information. The analysis of the energies of the supercells of different compositions allows us to study ordering phenomena and characteristics of phase diagrams in which modulated structures are present.</p>
