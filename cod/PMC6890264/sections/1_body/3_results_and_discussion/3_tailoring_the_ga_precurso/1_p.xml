<p>We have discussed above two extreme cases of reactivity imbalance: whereas GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP is too inert, hardly leading to any change in the parent Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S NCs, noncomplexed GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> is too reactive toward the sulfide anions, thereby etching the parent NCs without any significant cation exchange. In the following, we will tailor the chemistry of the Ga precursor complex to allow successful Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> cation exchange.
