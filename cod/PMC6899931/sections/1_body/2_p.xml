<p>Herein, we report on the synthesis, crystal structure, and chemical bonding of a silicon framework embedding cationic magnesium in a binary compound. MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> was obtained by high‐pressure synthesis between 5(1) and 10(1) GPa upon heating to temperatures between 1173(120) K and 1373(150) K and quenching to room temperature before decompression. At normal pressure, the diamagnetic compound decomposed at 468(10) K (see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The new compound was first discovered by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in form of domains in matrices of

 <sub>9</sub>Si
 <sub>5</sub> and (
 <italic>cF</italic>8)Si. Specimens suitable for selected area electron diffraction experiments were prepared by the focused ion beam (FIB) lift‐out technique (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure S3). Manual electron diffraction tomography measurements yielded 354 reflections indicating the space group
