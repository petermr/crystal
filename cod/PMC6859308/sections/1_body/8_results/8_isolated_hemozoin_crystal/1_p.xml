<p>The Fe X-ray fluorescence map shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> reveals several isolated hemozoin crystals outside infected red blood cells. Regarding the origin of these ex vivo crystals, we present 2 scenarios. The crystals may have originated from rupture of previous-generation parasites in the process of release of their daughter parasites at the end of the parasitic asexual red blood cell cycle (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is also possible that these crystals were released from those few parasites that were destroyed by BrQ. These ex vivo crystals are marked Hz1, Hz2, and so on in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>. A close-up view of Hz1 is shown both as Fe and Br maps in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>, providing prima facie evidence that the BrQ molecule has a distinct affinity to be absorbed onto the surface of hemozoin crystals.
