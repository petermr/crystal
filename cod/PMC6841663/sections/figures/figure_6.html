 <caption> Results of SFS illustrated by pair-plots of features under conditions ( a) N = 4 with four features, ( b) N = 8 with two features, and ( c) N = 12 with one feature. The blue and yellow dots represent particles in smectic- and nematic-like trajectories, respectively. For N = 4, the data for all pair-plots slightly overlap, indicating that one or two features cannot completely distinguish between the nematic- and smectic-like structures. For N = 8, the data for the pair-plots almost separate into two regions, suggesting good performance by the combination of two features. In contrast, the data for one feature are slightly overlapped. For N = 12, the data for the one feature are completely separated into two fields. The definitions of the order parameters D 1, Q 1, Q 2, Q 3, Q 4, Q 5, and Q 6 are shown in the Supporting Information. </caption>
