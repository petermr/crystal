<p id="Par7">The volume optimisation carried out from DFT for the three alkali antimonide structures shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref> shows a clear trend between the lattice parameter 
 <italic>a</italic> and the relative amount of Cs and K atoms. The largest lattice parameter is found in Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb, where 
 <italic>a</italic> = 9.38 Å, and its value monotonically decreases in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb (
 <italic>a</italic> = 9.23 Å) and in CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb (
 <italic>a</italic> = 8.76 Å), in agreement with x-ray diffraction measurements

 </sup>, validate our choice of the unit cell. Also the antimony-alkali bond lengths reproduce this behaviour. The distance between Sb and the alkali atom occupying the site A
 <sub>1</sub> and equivalently A
 <sub>3</sub> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), decreases monotonically with the relative amount of Cs atoms in the unit cell. In Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb the Sb-Cs distance is 4.06 Å, while in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and in CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb the bond length between Sb and Cs is equal to 4.00 Å and 3.79 Å, respectively.
