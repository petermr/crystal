    "Hydrogen storage is widely recognized as one of the biggest not solved problem within hydrogen technologies. The slow development of the materials and systems for hydrogen storage has resulted in a slow spread of hydrogen applications. There are many families of materials that can store hydrogen; among them, the alanate family can be of interest. Basic research papers and reviews have been focused on alanates of group 1 and 2. However, there are many alanates of transition metals, main group, and lanthanides that deserve attention in a review. This work is a comprehensive compilation of all known alanates. The approaches towards tuning the kinetics and thermodynamics of alanates are also covered in this review. These approaches are the formation of reactive composites, double cation alanates, or anion substitution. The crystallographic and X-ray diffraction characteristics of each alanate are presented along with this review. In the final sections, a discussion of the infrared, Raman, and thermodynamics was included."
