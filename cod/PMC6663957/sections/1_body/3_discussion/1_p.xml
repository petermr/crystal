<p id="Par57">A precise scanner model is essential to build a precise system matrix in the PET reconstruction. Simplified assumptions could cause wrong LOR coordinates and therefore wrong positioning of the source distribution. The effect of remapping the scanner into a virtual cylindrical scanner varies for different scanner geometries. When STIR operates in the cylindrical mode, it maps the block-type scanner on a cylinder with the same inner radius. This means LOR coordinates in the cylindrical mode are slightly different compared to the block mode. For a given LOR—described with azimuthal angle, polar angle, axial position, and tangential position—STIR tries to find the corresponding sinogram bin. Since detector positions in the cylindrical mode are rearranged for a block-type scanner, LORs could be assigned to wrong bins. Some bins might be chosen more often than in the correct geometry and some bins might be never chosen (zero bins in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Consequently, also the maximum number of counts per sinogram bin is different for the two models. This could be especially observed in the results for the rotating plane source which has a high statistics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
