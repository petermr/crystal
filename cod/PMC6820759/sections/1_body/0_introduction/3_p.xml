 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors with pure apatite structure for the first time. Traditional solidstate method was employed there. And crystallographic structure and morphology were characterized by using XRD, SEM, FT-IR, while photoluminescence spectra, quenching effect, energy transfer effect and fluorescence lifetimes were measured and analyzed. In addition, temperature dependent spectra also were measured, which indicated excellent thermal stability of 8% emission intensity decrease at 150 °C. The optimal white light emission at (0.309,0.309) with CCT 6848 K, belonging to cold white light, could be suitable applied in commercial w-LEDs application.
