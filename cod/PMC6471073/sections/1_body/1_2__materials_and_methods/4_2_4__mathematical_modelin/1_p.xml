<p>In the above section, all the rings and spokes are assumed to vibrate freely. However, in disk resonator gyroscopes, the structure must be fixed to the substrate and the DRG is always central-supported to reduce the support damping, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f001">Figure 1</xref>. So in the multiring DRG model in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the innermost ring should be completely fixed for the calculation. However, it is more complex for the mathematical modeling of a restrained structure than a free vibrating structure. So in this paper a simple way is proposed for the mathematical modeling of the central-supported DRG.
