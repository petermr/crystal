 <bold>4</bold>) (Scheme 
 <xref rid="anie201909423-fig-5003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is obtained in 20 % yield after column chromatographic workup of the reaction mixture. Besides crystals of

 <bold>5</bold>) were obtained and identified by single crystal X‐ray diffractions and by mass spectrometry. The structure of the latter compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was already reported.
