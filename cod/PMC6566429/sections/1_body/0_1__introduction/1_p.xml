<p>Terahertz (THz) waves lie between microwaves and infrared waves in the electromagnetic spectrum, and they have many special characteristics. Among the numerous applications of THz waves, THz imaging techniques have been receiving sustained attention in recent years due to several exciting advantages of THz waves. Compared to microwaves, with THz radiation it is easier to achieve higher carrier frequency and larger absolute bandwidth, which provide higher spatial resolution and more details of objects. Besides, THz waves can achieve imaging at higher frame rates, and can be used in video synthetic aperture radar (ViSAR) imaging. Compared to infrared waves, THz waves have the ability to penetrate non-metallic and liquid non-polar materials, which makes it possible to realize perspective imaging. In addition, the lower photon energy of THz waves nearly causes no harm to the human body under safety inspection. All these characteristics lead to promising prospects in biomedical imaging [
