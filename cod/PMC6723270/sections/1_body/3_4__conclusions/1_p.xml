<p>Changes in symmetry and microstructure of synthesized birnessite-type materials produced variations in their electrical properties and relaxation times for the electrical transport mechanism. Mn4 exhibited the highest conductivity, which was associated with turbostratic disorder, shorter Mn–O bond length, lower crystal size, higher Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> content, and higher surface area. For Mn8, the crystal size increment might have diminished the contact area between the particle agglomerates, making electron transport more difficult than in the Mn4 material. The enhanced conductivity with temperature suggests a thermally activated electron “hopping” and semiconductor behaviour for the synthesized materials. It is concluded that conductivity and other electronic-related phenomena can be tuned by varying the synthesis conditions.
