<p>Using Matlab and Mesodyn, we provide the visualization of the 3-dimensional morphology for the copolymer melt. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01081-f009">Figure 9</xref>a portrays another new morphology for the copolymer. It is seen from its 3-dimensional view that the B domains form a bicontinuous network with the wholly connected channels over the entire system to make many holes. The new morphology is considered to have no mirror planes along any axes. This notion rules out Pm3, P43m, and Pm3m symmetry, and there remain P23 and P432. It is then natural for us to assign P432 symmetry to this new mesophase, since P432 is a supergroup of P23. Furthermore, it is noted that the structural unit is a tripod, as is seen in the one-eighth piece of the unit cell in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01081-f009">Figure 9</xref>b.
