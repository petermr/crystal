 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f007">Figure 7</xref>. It can be seen from the fitting results of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f007">Figure 7</xref> that the conductivity curves for the four kinds of polyethylene have two turning points (namely, point A and point B), and three areas (namely, T1, T2, and T3), and four different density clusters. The field strengths corresponding to the A and B points of polyethylenes are given in Table 4. The slopes of the fitted straight line of the T1, T2, and T3 regions are given in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In addition, according to the 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <italic>I</italic> curve of the four different density polyethylenes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f006">Figure 6</xref>, we know that the electric conductivity values of LDPE, LLDPE, MDPE, and HDPE, respectively, decrease in the same field strength, so the conductivity is in the same field strength. The next is also reduced in turn. The carrier mobility is related to the migration barrier and the jump distance. As the density of polyethylene increases, the thickness and convergence of polyethylene platelets increase [
 <xref rid="B27-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the molecular chains of MDPE, HDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE are tight. The degree of compaction is weakened, and the compactness of the platelets is weakened in turn. Therefore, the height of the migration barrier is sequentially decreased. The jump distance is related to the thickness of the platelet. As the crystallinity increases, the thickness of the platelets increases, and the average jump distance increases. Hence, the rate of the carrier migration is significantly reduced as the crystallinity of the polyethylene increases.
