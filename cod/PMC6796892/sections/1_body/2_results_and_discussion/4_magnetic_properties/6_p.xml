<p>We have calculated the magnetic anisotropy energy
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>
 </sup> for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 and 1 in their ground-state C-AF configurations. For this, we have calculated the variation of total energy by changing the direction of the magnetization with the force theorem for the compositions 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 and 1. The calculated relative magneto anisotropy energies for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 with respect to the easy axis are 0, 0.125, 0.070, and 0.048 meV/f.u. and 0.592, 1.630, 0, and 0.185 meV/f.u. for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1 in the [001], [100], [110], and [111] directions, respectively. Therefore, the easy axis for PbTi
 <sub>0.5</sub>V
 <sub>0.5</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and PVO are [001] and [110], respectively. The change in magnetic easy axis from 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 to 1 can be attributed to the formation of vanadyl bond with increase in V concentration, i.e., the 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 composition is a BiCoO
 <sub>3</sub> like C-AF (so it shows similar easy axis), and with increase in V concentration, the tendency to form a 2D antiferromagnetism increases (which also reflects in our band structure).
