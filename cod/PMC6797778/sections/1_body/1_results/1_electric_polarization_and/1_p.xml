<p id="Par6">The bilayer 3R MoS
 <sub>2</sub> has the polar point group symmetry of 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3v</sub> with the polar axis along the z-axis. The 3R structure can be constructed by either AB or AC stacking sequence, which develops the spontaneous electric polarization in the opposite direction of each other as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The magnitude of electric polarization of the bilayer structure was calculated from the Berry phase method as 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.24 μCcm
 <sup>−2</sup>, in agreement with previous reports
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> shows the total energy of the bilayer structure (primitive cell consisting of 6 atoms) depending on the stacking sequence calculated from the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. Both the AB and AC stackings are stable and energetically degenerate structures. The AC stacking is obtained from the AB stacking by sliding the upper B layer along the +y direction by 1.82 Å. The interlayer translation over the weak vdW interaction results in the modest energy barrier Φ
 <sub>NEB</sub> = 15.0 meV.
