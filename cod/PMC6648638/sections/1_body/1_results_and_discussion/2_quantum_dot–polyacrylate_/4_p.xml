<p>In this study, photopolymerization was used to rapidly prepare a smooth surface of QD–polymer hybrid light-emitting films. In order to increase compatibility, the functional groups of the oligomers in the above hybrid films should match well with the polarity of the ligands on quantum dots. Then, the photoinitiator was added to the mixture of quantum dots and oligomer and uniformly mixed. The above mixture was spin-coated on a glass substrate and then subjected to ultraviolet light irradiation. A single-color QD–polymer hybrid light-emitting film can be obtained using this photopolymerization.

 </xref> shows the CIE-1931 coordinates and PL spectra of the green and red quantum dot–polymer hybrid light-emitting films. It can be seen that the quantum dots are well-dispersed in the B2 polymer. This is evidenced by the fact that the emission wavelength (green at 532 nm and red at 628 nm, respectively) of QD–polymer hybrid films is almost the same as that of the quantum dots dispersed in toluene, which ensures that the quantum dots are well compatible with the B2 polymer leading to no suspicion on the emission wavelength shift in subsequent applications. The CIE-1931 coordinates of green and red QD–polymer hybrid films located at (0.13, 0.64) and (0.67, 0.32) corresponds to the wavelength of 532 and 628 nm, respectively.
