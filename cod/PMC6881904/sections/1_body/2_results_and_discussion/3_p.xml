<p>From the SEM micrograph of Na

 </xref>d, it can be seen that the prepared phosphors are well crystallized into polyhedron and have size distribution from 250 nm to 1.25 μm. To explore elemental composition as well as its distribution of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>-doped Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub> phosphors, EDX mapping analysis was done for the Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>:60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> sample (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaelm.9b00527/suppl_file/el9b00527_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S5</ext-link>). The EDX elemental composition was determined by comparing relative peak intensities together with the corresponding sensitivity factors of each element and assuming their total intensities to be 100%. All the elements of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, Al
 <sup>3+</sup>, F
 <sup>–</sup>, and Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> were clearly detected (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>e) and homogeneously mapped in the as-obtained phosphors (

 <sup>3+</sup> and that of Al
 <sup>3+</sup> are further calculated to be about 66% and 34%, respectively, which are very close to the stoichiometric compositions of 60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> and 40% Al
 <sup>3+</sup> in the prepared sample.
