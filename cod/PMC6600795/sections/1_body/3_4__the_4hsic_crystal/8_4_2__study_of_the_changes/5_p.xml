<p>The hexagon corresponding to the undeformed crystal is equilateral, meaning that all the sides have the same length, and it is also equiangular, meaning that the vertex angles are equal. In the display of the FFT in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, the increase in the levels of red of the pixels indicate the predominant frequencies in the analyzed image. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f006">Figure 6</xref> represents the ensemble of all the hexagons present in the analyzed image. The levels of intensity of the pixels represent the predominant shapes. It is possible to see that the main deviations from the original shape are of the order of a small number of pixels of lesser intensity (fewer in number). Therefore, applying the concept of ergodicity, we can represent the ensemble averages by the configurations shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f007">Figure 7</xref>.
