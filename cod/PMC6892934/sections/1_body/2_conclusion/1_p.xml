<p id="Par32">We have presented a comprehensive analysis of the effect of helium-implantation damage on the mechanical properties of tungsten. TEM of the cross-section of an indent in the implanted sample showed that dislocations “sweep out” helium-implantation-induced defects, leaving behind low defect density zones/channels. This “sweeping out” leads to a localisation of deformation and a softening of the material with increasing plastic deformation. Qualitatively this explains the substantial increase in pile-up and the localisation of deformation leading to slip steps. A physically-based CPFE model was constructed where initial hardening due to interaction of dislocation with irradiation defects, as well as subsequent softening is accounted for. Importantly this model has only one additional fitting parameter, for simulating helium-implanted tungsten, besides fitting parameters for CRSS and hardening co-efficient which are essential for simulating pure tungsten. It successfully captures the changes in load-displacement curve, changes in pile-up structure, lattice rotations and residual lattice strains, as well as GND population in remarkably good agreement with our experimental observations. The results highlight that even a comparatively small concentration of irradiation/implantation induces defects – 1500 appm – can produce dramatic changes in the mechanical behaviour, with strain hardening being replaced by a large increase in the initial hardness followed by strain softening. The accuracy of predictions of the CPFE model developed here inspires confidence that such physically-based models that capture the key mechanisms governing irradiation-induced changes, can be effectively used to determine the evolution of mechanical properties in fusion reactor armour components and assessing their in-service performance.</p>
