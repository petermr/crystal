<p>Subsequently, these Au core nanoparticles were covered with silver shells of about 30 nm thick by ascorbic acid reduction process, following Uzayisengaâ€™s method (

 <sub>3</sub>-citrate solution, and 4.5 ml of 10 mM ascorbic acid solution were mixed at room temperature for 5 min before 0.35 ml of 20 mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> aqueous solution was slowly added dropwise at room temperature. Mixed solution was continuously stirred vigorously for 25 min to complete reaction to form Au@Ag NPs.
