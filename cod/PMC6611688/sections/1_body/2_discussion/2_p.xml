<p>In summary, the concept of ferroelectric metals predicted in the 1960s has been realized in a Weyl semimetal, WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. A combination of experimental and first-principles DFT techniques demonstrates the coexistence of native metallicity and ferroelectricity at room temperature. Bulk crystalline WTe
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits bistable polarization states that are switchable under an external electric field—thus, ferroelectricity is a bulk property of WTe
 <sub>2</sub>—and is not just confined to few-layer samples. The investigation of ferroelectric domain walls (
