<p>In addition to high affinity rG binding, 
 <italic>env1</italic> also recognizes more structurally divergent 2′-dG derivatives. Compared to 
 <italic>M. florum</italic> 2′-dG-I, 
 <italic>env1</italic> is more tolerant toward chemically related compounds as demonstrated by its higher binding affinities and weaker discrimination against the antiviral drugs acyclovir and pencyclovir. 
 <italic>Env1</italic> binds acyclovir and pencyclovir more tightly (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>D</sub> = 560 ± 10 nM and 2.0 ± 0.1 μM, respectively) than 
 <italic>M. florum</italic> (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>D</sub> = 4.8 ± 1.3 and 22 ± 1.1 μM, respectively), and displays a lowered ability to discriminate between the antiviral and 2′-dG (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>rel,</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>env1</sub>
 </italic>
 <sub>(lig/2′-dG)</sub> = 16 for acyclovir and 59 for pencyclovir; 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>rel,</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>M. florum</sub>
 </italic>
 <sub>(lig/2′-dG)</sub> = 28 for acyclovir and 132 for pencyclovir). Thus, while the 
 <italic>env1</italic> riboswitch achieves higher affinity binding for 2′-dG than other riboswitches, it appears that its ability to discriminate between closely related metabolites and RNA-binding drugs is significantly diminished—a noteworthy example that higher affinity binding does not necessarily correlate with higher specificity.
