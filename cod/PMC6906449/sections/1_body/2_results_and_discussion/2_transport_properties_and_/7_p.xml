 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, in which we have observed two endothermic effects at ~623 K and 658 K, corresponding to the phase transitions mentioned above. Although the high temperature XRD patterns (403K–773K), shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, are insufficient to demonstrate the phase transitions, as all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the chalcopyrite AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> (PDF:75-0119) with no visible movement of the peak positions, we can not rule out the possibility that the materials have undergone order-disorder transitions. These transitions are formed due to the Ag-In antisite occupancy starting in the critical temperatures

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>

 </sup>. At around ~620 K, the partial chalcopyrite structure (assumed to be the α phase) is transited to sphalerite structure (β phase) followed by the co-existence of the two phase field (α + β) in the temperature range from 620 K to 655 K. The transition from the α to β phase likely results from the formation of In
 <sub>Ag</sub> antisite defect. However, above ~655 K, the high energy allows all the α phase to be transformed to the β phase. Alternatively, the β phase returns to the α phase above 655 K due to the dissolvation of the antisite defect In
 <sub>Ag</sub>. The order-disorder transformation was also observed in the ZnTe-doped CuInTe
 <sub>2</sub> system

 </sup>. However, it is very difficult to unravel its nature at the moment, and a detailed investigation and analysis is therefore necessary. Anyhow, what is certain is that the abrupt changes of the Seebeck coefficients at around 620 K and 660 K should be caused by the phase transitions, rather than by the precipitation of the impurity phase Te and/or AgTe
 <sub>3</sub> since all the samples have similar transitions at these temperatures, including the sample at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.1 with no impurity phases precipitated (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>). Although the heat-treated sample at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.15 was purified with only trace impurity Te in the matrix, it exhibits the similar temperature dependence of the TE performance to the non-treated samples (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>). In addition, the heat-treated sample at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.15 gives the highest ZT value of 0.62 at 814 K, more than 2 times that of the pristine AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub>.
