 <p>The shared data is the unpublished portion of the experimental section for the article with the title “NHC–Au(I) catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular [4 + 3] cycloaddition of furan propargyl esters”.[1] The preparation of the intermediates for chiral NHC-gold(I) complexes and the furan propargyl ester substrates are included in this article. The 
  <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
  <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of the gold complexes 
  <bold>17a-19c</bold> and the X-ray crystal data of 
  <bold>17a</bold>, 
  <bold>18a</bold> and cycloaddition product 
  <bold>24</bold> are also provided in this article or in Mendeley Data. Finally, the chiral HPLC spectra used to determine enantiomeric excess and Cartesian coordinates of the optimized structure of 
  <bold>25</bold> and 
  <bold>26</bold> calculated by DFT calculation are also presented in the article.
