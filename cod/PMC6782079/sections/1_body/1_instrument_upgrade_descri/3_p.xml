<p>Before the start of this project, most of the instrument components were built on only one half of the instrument, which included the detectors and the coarse and fine radial collimators. The sample vacuum vessel was built of aluminium with a tear-drop shape, with two 5 mm-thick Al windows. The previous design incorporated a steel shielding shroud that surrounded the vessel to support the coarse radial collimator assembly. This shroud structure blocked access to the downstream optics and masked the window. The new sample vacuum vessel is cylindrical and fabricated from ASTM A316L stainless steel, with 3 mm-thick aluminium windows, and incorporates two new high-efficiency turbo pumps. The vessel was also designed to support large sample environment ancillary equipment, such as a 5 T magnet. It is lined with vacuum-compatible 7 mm-thick reaction-bonded boron carbide on the inside surfaces and 5 mm Mirrobor (high boron content flexible neutron shielding purchased from Mirrotron) outside around the windows to reduce background.</p>
