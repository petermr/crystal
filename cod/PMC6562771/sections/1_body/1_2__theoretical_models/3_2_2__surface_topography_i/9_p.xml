<p>The theoretical results for the vibrations and other influencing factors for the surface topography model on the radial direction are therefore summarized in 
 <xref rid="micromachines-10-00288-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. As demonstrated, the influence of vibration on the surface topography has been comprehensively considered and analyzed. However, the other influencing factors, for instance the error components in relation to the machine tool structure, are only preliminarily explored. In fact, the influencing factors of surface topography on the radial direction can be categorized into static error component and dynamic error component. The dynamic error component, including the vibration between the diamond tool and workpiece surface, is time-varying; while the static error components, including the positional and angular errors between the spindle, slide and diamond tool, do not vary with time. Therefore, to achieve a more accurate surface topography model, different strategies should be employed for the different error components. Specifically, the dynamics error components should be monitored by the instruments to acquire the real-time signal. In addition, the static error component is accurately determined before the cutting experiments. Subsequently, a more accurate surface topography model is built under the consideration of both the real-time signal and the measured static error components.
