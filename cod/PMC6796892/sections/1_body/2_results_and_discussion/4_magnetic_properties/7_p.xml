<p>To get deeper understanding of the magnetic properties of PVO, we have simulated the XMCD and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) at the L
 <sub>2,3</sub> edges of V in the ferromagnetic configuration of PVO. The XMCD and XAS spectra along with the left- and right-polarized spectra for V atom in PVO are given in

The obtained orbital moment of −0.039 μ
 <sub>B</sub> for V is consistent with that obtained directly from the self-consistent calculations (−0.045 μ
 <sub>B</sub>). The sum rule analysis results in a spin moment of 0.8 μ
 <sub>B</sub>/V for the V L
 <sub>2,3</sub> edges. However, this varies notably from the value calculated by the self-consistent field (SCF) method, which is ∼1 μ
 <sub>B</sub>/V. Detailed analysis on different 3d compounds by Wende et al.
