<p>In general case, the distribution of the optical field (5) will form a diffraction structure representing the superposition of five diffraction gratings:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>two phase polymer ones (for ordinary and extraordinary waves), formed due to photo-polymerization processes and inter-diffusion of the components of the media;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>two phase liquid crystal ones (for ordinary and extraordinary waves), formed due only to diffusion processes;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>polarization liquid-crystal one, formed due to the orientation of LC molecules under the action of electrical field of recording waves.</p>
