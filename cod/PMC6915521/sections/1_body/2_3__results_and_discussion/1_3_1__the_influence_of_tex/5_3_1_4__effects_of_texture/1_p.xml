<p>To investigate the effects of texture shape, three textured surfaces with different texture shapes are modeled, including #-shape, rectangular and v-shape, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f014">Figure 14</xref>. For the #-shape texture, the width of the horizontal or the longitudinal texture is 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.3615 nm, and the spacing is a 1.446 nm Ã— 1.446 nm rectangular dimple. For the rectangular and v-shape textures, the width is 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.723 nm, and the spacing is 
 <italic>g</italic> = 1.0845 nm. The depth is 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.723 nm, and the density is 40%.
