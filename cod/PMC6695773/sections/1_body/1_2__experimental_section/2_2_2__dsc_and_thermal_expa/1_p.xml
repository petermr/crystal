<p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test was carried out on the NETZSCH 204 F1 using bulk sample in the Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> crucible, and the heating/cooling rate was 10 °C/min in the argon atmosphere. Thermal expansion measurement was carried out on the WRP-1 equipment with a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min. The sample size for thermal expansion test was 25 mm × 2 mm × 1 mm according to ASTM (American society for testing and materials) standards.
