<p id="Par17">An analysis of the structural modifications obtained for cubic LZO and monoclinic LTO allows us to identify the main structural features conferring resistance to electronic excitation. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows an example of structural modifications obtained at 600 K and 0.8% excitation concentration for cubic LZO, and at 300 K and 0.8% excitation concentration for monoclinic LTO crystals. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9(a)</xref> shows that in the cubic LZO crystal, the zigzag corner sharing ZrO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedral arrangement is mostly preserved, even if some O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules have been formed in the structure. However, in the case of the monoclinic LTO crystal, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9(b)</xref> shows that the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules more strongly disturbs the octahedral connectivity. The structural origin of these modifications is the possibility for TiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra to rotate along the axis by which they are linearly inter-connected. As evidenced in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9(b)</xref>, at 300 K and 0.8% excitation concentration, only the middle layer #2 shows sign of octahedral rotation coupled with the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules, while in the layers #1 above and #3 below, no octahedral rotations occur and no O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules are formed. At higher temperature and excitation concentration, octahedral rotations and formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules occur in all the layers. Octahedral rotations allow the monoclinic LTO structure to accommodate electronic excitation with more flexibility, but they also facilitate the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules, making the amorphization easier; ultimately, this results in the structure being less resistant to excitation. In the cubic pyrochlore structure, such octahedral rotation is prevented by the zigzag connectivity network between ZrO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. A similar structural analysis performed for the 50% Zr monoclinic Z-LTO crystal indicates that 0.4% excitation concentration yields no to very little octahedral rotations for all the temperatures studied. This makes the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules harder and the transition temperature increases to 600 K, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. However, at 0.8% excitation concentration, octahedral rotations occur at 400 K and above. This suggests that the presence of Zr in monoclinic LTO not only contributes to increase the band gap but also impedes octahedral rotations, making the monoclinic Z-LTO structure more resistant to electronic excitation.
