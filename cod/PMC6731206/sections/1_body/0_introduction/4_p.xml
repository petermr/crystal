<p id="p0020">Technological scheme of bacterial-chemical leaching of sulfide cobalt-copper-nickel ores of Shanuch deposit with three-stage mode was carried out in the Research Geotechnological Center of Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences (RGC FEB RAS) 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The following indexes of nonferrous metal extraction were obtained: Ni – 73.3%, Со – 67.5%, Сu – 15.6%. However, there is not anything about waste water purification in the mentioned work. Both low-concentrated and high-concentrated washing solutions are formed during the bacterial-chemical leaching of sulfide cobalt-copper-nickel ores in a stirred tank. It happens under the cake blow of leaching from product solution at the end. Leaching cake is washed twice keeping the ratio S(solid):L(liquid) = 1:5. Thus, the volume of washing solutions is 2 times higher than the volume of product solution. A part of such water returns in a technological cycle, another part necessarily enters the waste. In accordance with chemical analytical data it was determined that in the first part of washing solutions a fraction of non-ferrous metals was in the range 6.0–8.5 % from the concentration of product solution. It seems advisable to remove valuable components from washing and waste water.
