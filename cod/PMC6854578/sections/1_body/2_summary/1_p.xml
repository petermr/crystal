<p>The solid–liquid interface between a NaCl crystal and its solution along the (100) direction of crystal has been studied systematically by using the molecular dynamics method. By calculating the various distributions of structural parameters, especially by distinguishing coordination environments of ions, we obtain the following main conclusions: (1) In the first layer nearest to the crystal surface, both cation and anion deviate from the epitaxial position of lattice. The magnitude of deviations strongly depends on the local coordination environments of ions. (2) The coordination between anions and cations has a little effect on the FHS of Na
 <sup>+</sup> but has a significant impact on all aspects of the FHS of Cl
 <sup>–</sup>. (3) As approaching to the interface, the hydration structure of ions tends to be ordered; however, it is unconventional that the dipole orientation of water molecules in the FHS has the tendency of disordering. The current results may be helpful to further understand the thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of ions at interfaces.
