<p>The spontaneous dissociation of water near metal oxide interfaces, and the proton transport properties of the interface, are of fundamental interest for catalysis, electrochemistry, and geochemistry. Here, on the basis of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a first-principles-quality neural network potential, we explored Grotthuss-like proton diffusion at the two most stable surfaces of zinc oxide in contact with liquid water, revealing fundamentally different surface properties for different surface geometries. In these simulations, no “extrinsic” protons or proton holes were introduced; instead, the protons diffuse

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such an analysis has been carried out for any metal-oxide–liquid-water interface. We found that, whereas proton diffusion at the ZnO(101[combining macron]0)–liquid-water interface is pseudo-one-dimensional, occurring mainly along the nonpolar ±[12[combining macron]10] directions, it is two-dimensional at the ZnO(112[combining macron]0)–liquid-water interface, occurring both along the nonpolar ±[11[combining macron]00] directions and the polar ±[0001] directions. For both surfaces, proton diffusion is considerably slower than the diffusion of H
