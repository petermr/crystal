<p id="Par7">To analyze crystal structures, single crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku XtaLAB PRO diffractometer (Mo Source, K
 <sub>α</sub> = 0.71073 Å) equipped with a DECTRIS Pilatus 200 K area detector. Data collection and reduction used the CrysAlisPro program

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> (insets) shows the pictures of crystals for the data collection, stuck on top of needles. Crystals ‘a’ and ‘b’ appeared similar visually, with sheet morphologies; [001] direction is perpendicular to the plane of the plate. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> gives the precession images of [HK0] and [H0L] reciprocal lattice planes, showing lattice strain effects associated with smeared diffraction spots in the L direction for ‘crystal a’; this crystal has a relatively broad C(T) peak (
