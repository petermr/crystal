<p id="Par5">In this work, we theoretically show the possibility of the ferroelectric switching of the bilayer 3R MoS
 <sub>2</sub> using the intense light pulse through the anharmonic phonon coupling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that a large amplitude vibration of infrared mode can effectively lower the ferroelectric switching barrier, and induce an unidirectional anharmonic force on the interlayer shear mode along the switching direction. This effect depends on the polarization angle of the incident light pulse with respect to the crystallographic axis of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> according to the selection rule. Lattice dynamics simulations indicate the possibility of dynamical ferroelectric switching through the coherent amplification of the interlayer shear mode and the lowering of the energy barrier under the repetitive pulses within a few picoseconds.
