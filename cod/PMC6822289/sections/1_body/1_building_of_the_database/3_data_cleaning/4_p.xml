<p>To extend the database, we added new structures from the literature research by querying papers that contain the keywords “covalent–organic framework” or “COF” in the title. For most of the new structures, we had to manually parse the coordinates and apply a few modifications: solvent removal, manual fix of partial occupations, unit cell’s realignment for 2D COFs, or correction of typos in the original publication.</p>
