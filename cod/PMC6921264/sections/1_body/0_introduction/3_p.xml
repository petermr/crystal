<p>It is interesting to reveal how to keep the balance in high energy materials with great safety. In addition, under the Hugoniot relation, which governs the detonation process, the energy, pressure, and volume of an explosive before and after a shock are involved. Prediction of the lattice structure is therefore, important to locate the detonation performances of EMs. As we know, energy release and stability maintenance of EMs should be both related to the response under external stimuli. Since the discovery of LLM-105 in the mid-1990, numerous studies have been attracting attention to thermal studies, equation of state (EOS) measurements, and sensitivity of LLM-105.

 </sup> have studied the structural stability of LLM-105 under different pressures and temperatures by X-ray diffraction, pressure-dependent Raman and infrared spectra, indicating that a structure phase transition occurs at approximately 30 GPa. Although many experiments have been performed, it is vague to comprehend the microscopic response mechanisms within the external stimulus.
