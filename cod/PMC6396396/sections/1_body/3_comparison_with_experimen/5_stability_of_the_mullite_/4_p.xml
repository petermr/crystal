<p>In the following the total energies of the DFT calculations are used to further investigate the solid solution range of mullite. It is not straightforward to compare the energies of different systems if the chemical composition is not identical. The energy contributions of the vacancy and Al/Si distribution of mullite were isolated from the chemical composition by subtracting the total energy of a supercell from a chemically identical system consisting of α-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. In Fig. 12
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12"> ▸</xref> this energy difference is plotted against the vacancy concentration. The main observation is that the relative stability of mullite decreases with increasing vacancy concentration. The energies of AS1 and AS2 are essentially identical, whereas AS3 is significantly less stable than AS1. However, according to the calculations only kyanite is more stable than a chemically identical mixture of α-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and any mullite supercell is less stable. Interestingly, the linear dependence of the energy on the vacancy concentration seems to be independent of the block lengths, indicating that the vacancy concentration or chemical composition is more important than the actual vacancy distribution. This may explain why in mullite the tendency for long-range vacancy ordering is not very pronounced.
