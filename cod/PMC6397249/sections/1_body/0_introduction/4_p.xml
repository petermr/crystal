<p id="Par5">In this work we introduce a concept of designing color in gold-based metallic glasses by precipitating finely dispersed gold-rich microdendrites of chosen chromaticity in a white-gold metallic glass matrix to create a MGMC microstructure. We demonstrate that by controlling the color, volume fraction, size, and overall morphology of the dendrites, gold MGMCs with a visually uniform color of choice may be produced having significantly improved hardness compared to traditional gold alloys.</p>
