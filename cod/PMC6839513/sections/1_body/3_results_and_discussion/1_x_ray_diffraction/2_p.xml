 </sup> Information from net planes parallel to the substrate are derived from specular scans, typically referred to as θ/2θ or θ/θ. Such measurements show that our optimized samples are highly textured, i.e., have one contact plane (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b00857/suppl_file/cg9b00857_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>). Using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, net planes not parallel to the surface become accessible, allowing the in-plane packing to be understood. GIXD measurements were performed by setting a defined angle of incidence of 1°. This damps the evanescent wave, but using high incident angles reduces the beam footprint at the sample enormously. Having a constant X-ray beam size, the photon flux onto the sample surface increases, while a smaller size/extension of the footprint then allows getting sufficient quality data; using a two-dimensional area detector on extended thin film samples results in severe peak smearing under grazing conditions. In addition, most pharmaceutical thin film samples consist of large crystals in the in-plane directions; thus a poor statistic often results when a measurement at only one azimuth is taken. For this reason, the sample requires rotation by 360° around its surface normal during data collection so that all diffraction spots are accessible making it a rotating GIXD experiment.
