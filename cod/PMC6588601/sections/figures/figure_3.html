 <caption> Characteristics of the cation displacements. a Key partial pair-distribution functions for the refined PbMg 1/3Nb 2/3O 3 configuration. The Nb–O and Pb–O peaks are split, suggesting off-centering of the respective cations. In contrast, the Mg–O distribution exhibits a single symmetric peak. b A stereographic-projection map of the Pb displacements demonstrating their preference for the 〈111〉 directions. (The black lines indicate traces of the {110} planes). c A slice (at z ≈ 0.17 Å) of the probability density distribution for the Pb atoms revealing the four maxima offset along the 〈111〉 directions. d Magnitude of the Pb displacements as a function of the local Mg/Nb ratio around Pb. The inset illustrates the [PbO 12(Mg/Nb) 8] coordination. Pb, O, Mg, and Nb species are represented by the blue, light gray, red, and yellow spheres, respectively. The error bars represent single standard deviations estimated by analyzing three independently refined configurations </caption>
