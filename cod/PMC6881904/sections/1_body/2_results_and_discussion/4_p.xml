<p>To investigate the photoluminescence properties of Na

 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors, excitation and emission spectra were recorded for the Na

 </xref>a. By monitoring the emission wavelength at 720 nm, we detected two excitation peaks (420 and 620 nm) due to the d–d inner transitions of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> from the 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> ground state to the 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>1</sub>(4F) and T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) intermediate states,

 </sup> respectively. By increasing Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration, the excitation peaks were observed to performs noticeable red-shift after normalizing all the excitation spectra at wavelength ∼420 nm (

 <sub>6</sub>:Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> generally spans from 640 to 850 nm, has a full width at half-maximum of about 95 nm, and overlaps well with the “active” peaks at about 670, 760, and 825 nm of cells and DNA/RNA synthesis for phototherapy.
