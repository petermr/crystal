<p>The excellent reversibility of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin films in the three electrolyte solutions indicates that the surface of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> electrodes are not passivated in these electrolyte solutions. Thus, we performed XPS analyses of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the magnesium metal thin film immersed in the electrolyte solution to confirm the absence of the passivation layer. The BuMeG3 solution was chosen for the surface analysis because we previously observed the formation of MgF
 <sub>2</sub>-based passivation layer at the surface of a commercial magnesium foil (Kuwata et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows F1s XPS spectra of the sputtered Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and magnesium metal thin films. Despite our expectation, both of the thin films showed similar spectra to that we observed at the surface of the magnesium foil. The spectra have peaks at 688.8 eV, corresponding to the residue of the TFSA anion at the surface of the electrodes. The TFSA residue gradually decreased and mostly disappeared after 10 seconds of the argon sputtering. Another peak corresponding to the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> simultaneously appeared at 685.7 eV during the further sputtering process. The formation of the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> layer is a direct evidence of the cathodic decomposition of the TFSA anion in the electrolyte solution. Even though the relatively weak peak intensity of the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> on the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> suggests the formation of thinner or less dense surface layer, the formation of MgF
 <sub>2</sub> proves that the equilibrium potential of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> (0.28 V vs. Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>/Mg) is still low enough to reduce the TFSA anion. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> shows Mg2p spectra of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the magnesium metal thin films. Even with the fitting result, the removal of the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> is not clearly confirmed in the Mg2p XPS spectra of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, because the peak corresponding to the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> are overlapped with each other around 49.8 eV. It shows the Mg atoms in the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> phase is positively charged and behave as cations in the solid phase. The Mg2p spectra for the magnesium metal thin film shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> are good reference to understand the structure of the surface layer. A peak corresponding to the magnesium metal appears after 10 seconds of the argon sputtering process at 48.7 eV. Then the peak intensity of the magnesium metal gradually increased during the following sputtering process. Since the decrease of the peak intensity of the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> layer is strongly associated with the F1s spectra, we conclude that the main component of the surface layer on these electrodes is MgF
 <sub>2</sub>. As already discussed in section Electrochemical properties of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film electrodes, the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film electrode shows 100 mV of overpotential in the BuMeG3 solution, even with the formation of the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> layer. Moreover, the similarity of the surface layer on the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and magnesium metal thin films, suggests that the MgF
 <sub>2</sub> does not completely passivate the surface of the both electrodes. Therefore, we think that the origin of the high overpotential of the magnesium deposition/dissolution process in the glyme-based electrolyte solution is not the resistance of the surface layer, but the activation energy of the actual electrode reaction process, which consists of several reaction steps such as adsorption of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, desolvation, electron-transfer, surface, and bulk diffusion of Mg atoms and so forth. Among these reaction steps, we speculate the electron-transfer process significantly contributes to the overpotential, because the biggest difference of the electrode reactions between the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the magnesium metal, is the oxidation state of the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. As presented in the Mg2p XPS spectra in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in the electrolyte solution are not reduced to the Mg atoms in the case of Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>, on the other hand, the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions are reduced to the magnesium metal during the electrodeposition process. Further analytical studies are necessary to be conducted to determine the origin of the overpotential.
