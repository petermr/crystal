<p>The thermal properties of polyethylene with four different densities were tested by differential scanning calorimetry (METTLER TOLEDO in Zurich, Switzerland). During the experiment, 0.005–0.007 g samples were weighed and placed in aluminum crucibles, protected by high-purity nitrogen. Moreover, the heating and cooling temperature rate were set to 10 °C/min. The sample was first heated to 200 °C to completely melt, eliminating the influence of thermal history. Subsequently, it was cooled to 40 °C to obtain a crystallization process curve, and then heated to 200 °C to obtain a melting curve.</p>
