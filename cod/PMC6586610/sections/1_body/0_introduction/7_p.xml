 </sup> indicate that obtained results in (2 + 1) dimensions are very close to results obtained in (3 + 1) dimensions. Therefore, the direct solution of an exciton binding energy would be perfect regardless of surrounding medium. In this current work, exciton is regarded as 2 interacting oppositely charged fermions. Moreover, the solutions were obtained in 2 + 1 dimensions for a free-standing monolayer medium in order to eliminate any other external effects such as substrate, surrounding medium. For these purposes, two-body problem is exactly solved in 2 + 1 dimensions, firstly. Then, exciton binding energies and decay times are obtained in terms of spin and energy level of interacting particles as follows.
