<p>The DoE approach is a powerful method used to optimize processes and quantitatively estimate the effect that different variables have in a process and their possible interactions. For this work, a Full Factorial Design (2
 <italic>
  <sup>K</sup>
 </italic>) strategy was selected and two variables (
 <italic>K</italic> = 2) were analyzed: calcination temperature (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, in degrees) and time (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, in min). The evaluated response (
 <italic>Y</italic>, in percentage) was the purity of the obtained ferrite.
