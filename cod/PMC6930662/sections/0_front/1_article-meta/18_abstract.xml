 <p>In this paper, the columnar supramolecular aggregates of photosensitive star-shaped azobenzenes with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide core and azobenzene arms are analyzed theoretically by applying a combination of computer simulation techniques. Without a light stimulus, the azobenzene arms adopt the trans-state and build one-dimensional columns of stacked molecules during the first stage of the noncovalent association. These columnar aggregates represent the structural elements of more complex experimentally observed morphologies—fibers, spheres, gels, and others. Here, we determine the most favorable mutual orientations of the trans-stars in the stack in terms of (i) the

To this end, we calculate the binding energy diagrams using density functional theory. The model predictions are further compared with available experimental data. The intermolecular forces responsible for the stability of the stacks in crystals are quantified using Hirshfeld surface analysis. Finally, to characterize the self-assembly mechanism of the stars in solution, we calculate the hydrogen bond lengths, the normalized dipole moments and the binding energies as functions of the columnar length. For this, molecular dynamics trajectories are analyzed. Finally, we conclude about the cooperative nature of the self-assembly of star-shaped azobenzenes with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide core in aqueous solution.
