<p>When anisotropic material properties are implemented in the component phase of a composite, the alignment of component material’s local property coordinate system, with respect to the composite coordinate system, will affect the effective properties of the composite. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the u–v plane of the matrix material aligns perpendicular to the fiber axis. If the material property coordinate in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>b is rotated around the u-axis 90 degrees, the anisotropy plane of Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> will be parallel to the fiber axis direction. For the convenience of analysis, we shall refer to the two configurations mentioned above as configuration I and configuration II. In configuration I, the material property axes u, v, and w are parallel to the composite axes x
 <sub>2</sub>, y
 <sub>2</sub>, and z
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. In configuration II, the material property axes u, v, and w are parallel to the composite axes x
 <sub>2</sub>, z
 <sub>2</sub>, and y
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. The corresponding Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and maximum cooling capacities (∆T
 <sub>max</sub>) based on these two configurations were calculated using the derived mathematical model with respect to fiber rotation angle, 
 <italic>θ</italic>, and fiber volume fraction, 
 <italic>f</italic>. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f003">Figure 3</xref>.
