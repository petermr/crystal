<p>In all compounds, the alkali metal ions are coordinated by 10 oxygen atoms. Significant differences in 
 <italic>A</italic>−O distances and shapes of the coordination polyhedra between the 
 <italic>oC</italic>88′ and 
 <italic>oI</italic>88 modifications can be found (Figure S14 to S16, Supporting Information). The Rb−O distances in the 
 <italic>Cmce</italic> modification of 
 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic> (290.2(1) to 360.7(1) pm, average 317.4(1) pm) are longer than in the 
 <italic>Immb</italic> polymorph (279.6(1) to 336.9(1) pm, average 316.6(1) pm). The same holds for 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic>.
