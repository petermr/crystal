<p>The most common SiC polytypes have four and six SiC bi-layers to define unit cell repeating distance along c-axis [0001] directions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the ACAB sequence of 4HSiC crystal. The sequence is relative as radii of regions corresponding to each atom share the same magnitude. Hence, relative positions depend on possible geometrical arrangements of spheres.
