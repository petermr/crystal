<p>In the present study, the new nitridorhenium(V) complexes with five-membered N-heteroaromatic ligands, imidazole (Him),

 </xref> were synthesized and characterized to investigate luminescence onâ€“off properties for the tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complex by changes in weak interactions. In the complexes having Him and Mim, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of crystalline samples depending on the reaction conditions: six-coordinate complexes and also complexes including the additional one mole ratio of the N-heterocyclic molecule. Most newly synthesized complexes showed strong luminescence in the solid states at 296 K. Interestingly, we found that the Him-coordinated complex including one mole ratio of noncoordinating Him in the crystal was almost nonluminescent, while the Mim-coordinated complex containing one mole ratio of noncoordinating Mim in the crystal was strongly photoemissive. Luminescence-intensity changes between the five- and six-coordinate complexes and between the six-coordinate complexes with Him were investigated based on solvent-free mechanochemical and vacuum elimination reactions and an exposure of water to the solid complex. The origin of the luminescence intensity change is both formation/dissociation of weak interactions and the coordination bond between tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) and Him.
