 </xref>a presents Rietveld XRD refinement of BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors. The values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>p</sub>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>wp</sub>, and χ
 <sup>2</sup> were determined to be 7.74%, 11.71%, and 0.5308, respectively. The results implied that the refined results were of good quality.

 </xref>b shows the crystal structure of the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample. BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> was crystallized into a tetragonal system with the space group 
 <italic>I</italic>4/
 <italic>m</italic>. The Gd
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ta
 <sup>5+</sup> ions were surrounded by six O
 <sup>2–</sup> ions to form the [TaO
 <sub>6</sub>] octahedrons. The Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> ions were located in the middle of the gap between octahedrons. The obtained experimental cell parameters for the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample were calculated to be 
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> = 6.00416(6) Å, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 8.52159(16) Å, α = β = γ = 90°, 
 <italic>V</italic> = 307.202(5) Å
 <sup>3</sup>, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 2. Given that the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions prefer to occupy the octahedral and distorted octahedral sites and the ionic radius of the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.53 Å, coordination number (CN) = 6) was much closer to that of the Ta
 <sup>5+</sup> ions (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.64 Å, CN = 6) than that of the Gd
 <sup>3+</sup> ions (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.94 Å, CN = 6), so the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions could easily enter the Ta
 <sup>5+</sup> octahedral sites in the BGT host.
