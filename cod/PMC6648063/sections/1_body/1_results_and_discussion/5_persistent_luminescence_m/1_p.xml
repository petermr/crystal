<p>We have already analyzed the existing defects in BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> in detail. To understand the function of different kinds of defects to the persistent luminescence of materials better, we prepared the other co-doped trivalent rare-earth ion series sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1RE
 <sup>3+</sup> and characterized them with the thermoluminescence curve. In

 <sup>3+</sup>, Pr
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ho
 <sup>3+</sup>, Er
 <sup>3+</sup>, and Lu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, the intensities of thermoluminescence all increase. In the above order, the influence of trivalent rare-earth ions to the persistent luminescence property of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> decreases gradually. After co-doping Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> and Yb
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, the thermoluminescence intensity of the sample decreases on the contrary. Besides, a single-doped sample also possesses a persistent luminescence phenomenon. This indicated that traps exist in BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, which can store energy. Therefore, the energy storage center of the sample may be generated by V
