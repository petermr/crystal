<p>The colour coordinates and LE values of the obtained light sources were also calculated. The exact values are tabulated in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Table S6</xref> whereas the graphical representation is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The colour coordinates of the light sources obtained from Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) ceramic discs and 375 nm emitting LED shift closer to the edge of CIE 1931 colour space diagram if ceramics thickness is increased (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). This shows high colour purity of the emitted red light. Such result also goes hand in hand with emission spectra depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f007">Figure 7</xref>d, where emission from LED is completely absorbed by the thickest ceramic disk. Different results, however, were obtained when 400 nm emitting LED was used as an excitation source. The colour coordinates of these light sources lied in the purplish red spectral region of the CIE 1931 colour space diagram and shifted towards red region with increasing ceramics thickness (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). These results correlate well with emission spectra given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f007">Figure 7</xref>e. The blend of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> emission in ceramic disks and unabsorbed emission from LED yields the purplish red emission colour. The fraction of LED emission decreases with increasing ceramics thickness; hence, the red shift of colour coordinate. It turned out that no red light source can be obtained by combining Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) ceramic discs and 455 nm emitting LED. The absorption lines in this region by Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are just too narrow. Therefore, the major part of 455 nm LED emission passes through the ceramic disks unabsorbed regardless their thickness and all the colour coordinates of such light sources lie in the blue region of the CIE 1931 colour space diagram as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f008">Figure 8</xref>c.
