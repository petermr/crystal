<p id="Par19">In the same vein, one may argue that the proposed activation of the basal plane as presented in this work may also be valid for the edge sites. Therefore, the following discussion seeks to distinguish the role of each catalytic site. Since it has been well established that the edge sites are more easily oxidized than the basal plane
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>, it is possible to differentiate between peaks which correspond to the oxidation of each site. Following a procedure by Bonde et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>, nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> was cycled at anodic potentials under a constant flow of nitrogen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">30</xref>). Close examination of the anodic sweep reveals two distinct peaks corresponding to the oxidation of the edges (minor peak, maximum at +0.65 V (vs. NHE)) and the oxidation of the basal plane (major peak, maximum at +0.9 V (vs. NHE)). This correlates well with the literature work on MoS
 <sub>2</sub> by Bonde et al.

 </sup> In addition, a reduction wave (other than proton reduction) is observed at −0.24 V (vs. NHE). It should be noted that this reduction wave is always seen during the initial cycle of MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> and has been attributed to the reduction of surface oxides. As can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, by cycling nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> between −0.35 V and +1.05 V (vs. NHE), both edge sites and the basal plane are oxidized, resulting in a loss of catalytic activity and deactivation of the material.
