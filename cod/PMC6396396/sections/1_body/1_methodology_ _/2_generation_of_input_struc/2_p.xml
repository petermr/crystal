 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.5), a set of ten superstructures was generated (Table 1
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref>). Each supercell with a composition-dependent vacancy distribution is labelled as capital M followed by the first two decimal places of the rounded vacancy concentration, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> M40 for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.4. At first, the vacancy distribution is defined based on the unified superspace model described in Section 1.2
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1.2"/> resulting in a block model of vacancy blocks and vacancy-free blocks. In the second step (Fig. 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref>), triclusters and diclusters are distributed according to the vacancy distribution with atom coordinates derived from the average atom positions taken from Klar 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb39"> ▸</xref>). In the last step, the appropriate amount of Si atoms must be distributed over the tetrahedral sites, whereas all remaining cations are Al. Apart from the analysis of the modulated volumes of tetrahedra, there are only qualitative indications of which sites are favoured by Al and which sites are favoured by Si (Klar 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb39"> ▸</xref>). Therefore, we decided to systematically investigate all symmetry-compliant Al/Si ordering patterns for M0, M25, M33, M40 and M50 with FF methods. In total 46 814 supercells were geometrically optimized (static relaxation) with the GULP code (Gale, 1997
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb28"> ▸</xref>) applying the force model given by Matsui (1996
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb48"> ▸</xref>). These FF parameters proved to give acceptable results for many silicate systems, including sillimanite, andalusite and mullite (Matsui, 1996

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb18"> ▸</xref>; Adabifiroozjaei 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"> ▸</xref>). The main parameter of interest of the FF calculations was the total energy of a certain Al/Si ordering pattern to evaluate its stability. Several models, mainly the most stable ones, were subsequently used as input structures for DFT calculations.
