<p class="p">To stabilize the large Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> core, 30 monomeric (S-Au-S) staple motifs are distributed on the surface of the Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> core with highly ordered patterns. From the side view shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>, the staples self-assemble into an annulus pattern, which can be divided into three parts (marked with different colors): The 5-membered rings with 5 staple motifs near the poles of the Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> kernel are marked in red; the 10-membered ring consisting of 10 staple motifs on the equator is marked in yellow, and the remaining two 5-membered rings located in the midlatitude regions of the Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> core are marked in blue. From the top view (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>), the five-membered ring looks similar to a pentagonal ripple, and the red and blue rings are arranged in opposite rotary directions. All five rings surround a fivefold axis across the two opposite pentagons. Note that the Au
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> rhombicosidodecahedron has 12 pentagons and six fivefold axes (

  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">35</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, each fivefold axis can be encompassed by five rings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, the 10-membered ring on the equator can be separated into two alternate sets: One set consists of the five parallel staples along the fivefold axis, and the other deviates from the equator. Meanwhile, the five parallel staples can be regarded as the vertices of a penta-star (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>). In another view, the 30 staples can also be grouped into six penta-stars. The reverse orientations of the five rings give rise to the chirality of the Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Ph)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> nanoparticle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3E</xref>), and a pair of enantiomers are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3F</xref>. In contrast, the monomeric (S-Au-S) staple motifs in Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub> are replaced by triethylphosphine ligands directly connected to the outermost 30 palladium atoms, and the assumed 60 CO groups (disordered in the crystal) bridge the palladium atoms on the edges of Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub> (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub> does not exhibit the chirality found in Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>. To sum up, the Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub> structure shares some similarities with Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub>, but there are distinct differences as well.
