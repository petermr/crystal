<p>The DFT calculations on [ML14·H
 <sub>2</sub>O] (Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The long-range corrected hybrid density functional with damped atom–atom dispersion corrections wB97XD [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used together with the LANL2MB relativistic corrected pseudopotentials and basis sets [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for the metal atoms and the 6-31G (d,p) Gaussian basis set for the H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 macrocycle. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was used to include water as solvent.
