<p>It is well known that light is the basic factor of plant growth and development.

 </sup> Light can not only provide the energy needed for plant photosynthesis but also regulate plant life activities, such as seed germination, seedling formation, flowering, bearing, and other processes.

 </sup> Therefore, plant illumination technology is an indispensable part of modern agricultural development; especially for areas lacking land resources and light conditions, plant illumination is particularly important.

 </sup> As reported previously, the blue light around 450 nm (410–500 nm) and red light around 660 nm (610–700 nm) are important for photosynthesis, phototropism, and photomorphogenesis.

 </sup> At present, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) possess many advantages, such as energy savings, low cost, high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and long lifetimes, and could be considered as the main type of light source for both general lighting and plant growth lighting.

 </sup> According to the current situation, searching for phosphors with bright red emission for plant growth lighting is imperative.
