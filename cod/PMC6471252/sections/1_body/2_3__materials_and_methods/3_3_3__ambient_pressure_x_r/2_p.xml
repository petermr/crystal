<p>The structure was solved by SHELXT [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and then refined by SHELXL [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], both algorithms adopted in the Olex2 graphical user interface [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Carbon and oxygen atoms were refined anisotropically, while hydrogen atoms were positioned using SHELX angle-distance constraints and refined in riding approximation. Graphics were prepared with Mercury3.11 [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Jmol 14.6.4 [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
