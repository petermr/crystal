 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows two critical transformations during the subsequent deformation of the (001) nanoplate. In order to be consistent with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we only illustrated the atoms in the upper layer. Distributions of both stress and Z coordinates are presented. As seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, the stress distribution at 8 K resembles the situation at 1 K (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), and the bending exists (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). When the temperature increases to 9 K, the bending significantly develops, as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. Meanwhile, one can find that the originally built-up stress gaps disappear (comparing Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> a and b). The release of shear stress is resulted from this further bending deformation. Accordingly, the potential energy decreases (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and the nanoplate evolves into a more stable state. As for the second transition shown in Fig. 3, it starts at 129 K and finishes at 134 K, experiencing a broader temperature range. Note that after the transition occurring at 9 K, considerably large positive stress still exists in the middle area of the surface (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Actually, this state of stress maintains throughout the entire second stage of the shape change process (9–129 K) (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). Similarly, it is also the driving force of the following transition. Afterward, as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, those red atoms in Fig. 3e turn green (or blue), indicating that the existing positive stress is released. For the purpose of highlighting the shape transformation happening between 129 and 134 K, only half of the atoms in the upper surface are exhibited in Fig. 3 g and h, in which the green box singles out the changed area. The region in the green box buckles toward −
 <italic>Z</italic> direction, leading to the deviation from the former saddle shape. This deviation could also be confirmed by the obvious drop of
