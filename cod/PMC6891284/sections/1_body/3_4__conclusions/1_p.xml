<p>The growing popularity of robots in the service industry can be attributed to their low labor cost, high efficiency, and attractiveness to customers. Nevertheless, the development and improvement of delivery robots are imperative. In this study, according to the coordinate comparison diagram and error comparison diagram, it can be concluded that the positioning result of the UWB positioning system is of poor stability and low positioning accuracy. When UWB is used independently, it is difficult to provide reliable coordinate data for the food delivery robot. The positioning results of the improved track deduction algorithm are stable and the error of the food robot is small at the beginning of operation. However, with the increase of time, the cumulative error gradually increases and the final positioning accuracy is low. The fusion method of EKF is used to improve the stability and accuracy of the fusion coordinates, and the positioning error is less than 15 cm which can be accepted in a restaurant. Based on this method, the delivery robot has high positioning accuracy, low installation and maintenance costs, wide availability, and low impact on the restaurant layout. Moreover, it is simple and flexible in terms of changing the travel route. Future work will focus on enabling enable multiple delivery robots on site.</p>
