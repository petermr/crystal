Unlike 2D materials, a collection of 1D materials can have various arrangements. The lowest energy arrangements of the double and triple chains were chosen for the band structure calculation. Triangular arrangement of triple-chain V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> is more stable than linear V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>, which implies that aggregation stabilizes the energy of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> SCACs. Thus, we calculated the band structure of hexagonally stacked septuple-chain bundles for seven chains. As 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>a presents, bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> had an indirect band gap of 0.54 eV from point Γ to a point (0.419, 0, 0.419) near 
 <italic>M</italic> (0.5, 0, 0.5), designated as 
 <italic>T</italic>. However, all 1D few-chain systems had direct band gaps that increased as the number of chains decreased. The maximum band gap was 1.09 eV in a single chain. Direct band gaps appeared at point Γ, a local minimum point in the conduction bands of few-chain systems but a local maximum point of the bulk structure. Point Γ was a local energy maximum in the few-chain system, unlike in the bulk system. The band energies of the conduction band at point Γ decreased as the number of chains increased in the few-chain systems. However, the conduction band at point 
 <italic>T</italic> increased with the number of few-chain systems, whereas the conduction band energy of 
 <italic>T</italic> in the bulk was minimal. This implies that the stacking effect on the energy at point Γ in the bulk is different from that in the few-chain systems. The partial orbital analysis showed that point Γ had larger contributions to

 <italic>M</italic> is the reason that bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> has an indirect band gap while the few-chain V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> shows direct band gaps. The difference between the valence bands of bulk and few-chain systems is much smaller than the difference between the conduction bands. The number of chains has little influence on the valence band of few-chain and bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. The band structures of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> without the DFT-D3 dispersion energy correction are similar to the band structures with the DFT-D3, but the band gaps increase (
