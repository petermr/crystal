<p>Several alanates have been produced by metathesis promoted by mechanical milling, Equation (8). Once the milling parameters are well established, this method can be very simple and has many advantages. The main advantages include (i) total elimination of solvents and (ii) significant reduction of the reaction time [

The final result is a drastic reduction of the hydrogen capacity. Examples are the production of Mg(AlH
