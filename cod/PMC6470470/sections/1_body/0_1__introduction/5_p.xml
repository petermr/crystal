<p>Here, our main goal is to highlight the effective functional dependence of 
 <italic>B</italic> on the dislocation velocity within the theory of [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (and its numerical implementation of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), and to explain how to derive simple analytic representations of 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="mm11">
   <mrow>
    <mrow>
     <mi>B</mi>
     <mo>(</mo>
     <mi>v</mi>
     <mo>)</mo>
    </mrow>
   </mrow>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> that are amenable to subsequent use in applications (such as material strength models). We also present new results for metals and slip systems not presented in [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (i.e., prismatic and pyramidal slip for hcp metals). Thus, the current work in a sense complements Ref. [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the theory developed there.
