<p>Vs1 velocity patterns show maximum velocities for propagation directions at low angle to &lt;210&gt; directions and minimum velocities for propagation directions parallel to [010] and &lt;201&gt;. When propagating within the (010) plane, Vs1 velocities are rather low and display a 90° periodicity. Low Vs1 propagation anisotropy (&lt;3.5%) is observed within this plane, as well as within the (100) plane. The highest Vs1 propagation anisotropy is observed for propagation within the (001) plane. Vs2 velocities are low for propagation directions parallel to all three main crystallographic axes and minimum for propagation parallel to [010] and [001], as well as at approximately 20‐30° to the (100) plane and in the (010) plane at &gt;30° to [100]. High Vs2 are observed for propagation in the (001) plane at approximately 30° to [100] and in the (100) plane at approximately 30° to [001].</p>
