<p>The bandgap of 2D perovskites can also be changed by halide substitution. Replacing iodide with bromide and chloride will increase the bandgap of perovskite, because the maximum value of valence band (p orbitals) is lowered by the introduction of relatively high electronegative elements.[qv: 15d,16a,36,52,103] 2D perovskites with mixed halide such as (PEA)

 <sup>2+</sup> 6p orbital, and the continuous regulation of bandgap is therefore realized. Compared with the single halide perovskites, the mixed halide perovskites have inhomogeneous broader absorption peak due to the disordered distribution of halides in inorganic layers.
