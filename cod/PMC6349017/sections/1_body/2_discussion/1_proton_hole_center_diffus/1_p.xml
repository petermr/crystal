<p>The Grotthuss proton hole transport mechanism for OH
 <sup>–</sup> in aqueous solution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) relies on the fact that an OH
 <sup>–</sup> can participate in a proton transfer event with 
 <italic>multiple</italic> (at least two) neighboring H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules. If there were only one neighboring H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecule, the proton hole would have reached a “dead end”, forcing the next PT event to form again the previous OH
 <sup>–</sup> (barring hydrogen bond fluctuations). In dilute aqueous solutions, OH
 <sup>–</sup> accepts hydrogen bonds from three or four different H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules,
 <xref rid="cit2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> providing different pathways for the Grotthuss mechanism.
