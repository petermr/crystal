<p id="p0035">To model the electronic structure of the basic optical chromophore in polymethine dyes, their polymethine chain, Dähne [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] put forward the concept of an ideal polymethine state, according to which there is a clearly extended distribution of the density of the

 </inline-formula>-electron charge along the quasi-linear polymethine chain. This density varies periodically along the chain and reallocates alternately along it during optical excitation (see Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). Moreover, for the first excited state, the moment of the electronic transition is focused on the chain [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, the elementary electron-charge transfer along the chain can approximate the electronic transition to the first excited state [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The polymethine dyes to be discussed herein can be considered as the ideal polymethine state of Dähne.
