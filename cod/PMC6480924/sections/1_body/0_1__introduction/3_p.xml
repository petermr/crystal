<p>It is also known that the BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I) oxyhalide compounds have been widely used as catalysts in photocatalysis due to their strong intra-layer bonding force and weak interlayer van der Waals interaction [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These compounds usually consist of unique layered structures, which can efficiently separate the photogenerated electronâ€“hole pairs through the internal electric fields and further improve the charge transfer from host to activation center. Thus, the doped rare-earth ions in BiOX oxyhalides host can absorb the activation more conveniently, and emit more intense emission peaks [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, the radius and charge of Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> ion are like those of Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], suggesting that the Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> ions could be substituted by Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions in the BiOX lattice. All these studies further indicate that the compounds in BiOX oxyhalides family could be considered as host materials for Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> doping. Among these oxyhalide-based phosphors, the rare-earth ion-doped BiOCl phosphors have been rarely prepared. Herein, the green-yellow-emitting phosphors BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> were prepared for the first time. Their crystal structure, luminescent properties, lifetime, thermal quenching behavior, and quantum efficiency were studied in detail. Our investigation shows that the prepared products can be used as green-yellow phosphors for blue-light w-LEDs.
