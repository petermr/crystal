<p>By comparing the results between the composite with anisotropic component material and isotropic component material, it was found that the anisotropic component in single-crystal form in both the layered transverse thermoelectric composite and the fibrous transverse thermoelectric composite can provide a better cooling performance compared to their isotropic polycrystal counterpart. For the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub>/Copper composite at 300 K, the composite with the anisotropic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> single crystal improved the maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> by as much as 15% compared to the composite with the isotropic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> polycrystal. For the SnSe/Copper composite at 700 K, the improvement in the maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> for composite with SnSe single crystal component was as much as 51% compared to composite with isotropic SnSe polycrystal components. For the In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub>/Copper composite, the single-crystal form of In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub> had anisotropic Seebeck properties, but there are no existing studies regarding the effective properties of polycrystals with anisotropic Seebeck properties. Therefore, the comparison on the cooling performances for the In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub>/Copper composite between composites with isotropic and anisotropic In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub> phase properties was not presented.
