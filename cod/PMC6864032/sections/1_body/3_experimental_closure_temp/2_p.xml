<p id="Par9">We selected 6 augite single crystals from 4 small chips (5 to 10 grams) sampled at four different stratigraphic depths below the cooling surface of Theo’s Flow (red dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). One crystal has been selected from the peridotite (TSC 3.9) and five from the pyroxenite layers (TSC 3.12_1 TSC 3.12_2; TSC 3.22; TSC 3.31_1; TSC 3.31_2) sampled at different depths (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These results have been combined with those obtained by Domeneghetti
