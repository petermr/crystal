<p>Additional device structure optimization was made by using a two-step hole injection with both pTPD and another HTL material with a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital level, namely, PVK (poly[9-vinylcarbazole]). The best device structure for the blue LEDs was the following (

 </xref>a–c): ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pTPD/PVK/NCs/B2PYMPM (15 nm)/TPBi (45 nm)/LiF (1.2 nm)/Al (100 nm). Current-density curves reveal low leakage currents of the presented device structure (

 </xref>d). The turn-on voltages are in the range of 3–3.4 V, which is still higher than the emissive material band gaps (2.47 – 2.68 eV). EQE versus current-density and luminance curves of the devices presented in

 </xref>e,f show efficiency drops at higher currents/luminance. The best EQE values are 4.96%, 3.5%, 2.25%, and 1.03% for the devices with a EL peak at 502, 490, 476, and 463 nm, respectively (

Lower efficiency in a deep-blue spectral region might be associated with the lower PLQYs of Cl-containing NC perovskites.
