<p>The strong response to external stimuli and rich phase diagrams has given rise to numerous applications of soft matter materials in electronics, display devices, photonics, photovoltaics, coatings, and adhesives, to name a few. Another important property of many, but not all, soft matter systems is their ability to self-assemble, i.e., form complex ordered structures from basic units, such as nano- or colloidal particles [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Self-assembly allows one to fabricate new artificial materials by controlling macroscopic parameters, such as concentration and temperature, instead of manipulating each basic unit on a microscopic level. On the other hand, such self-assembled structures are prone to defects, which obviously have influence on the resulting functional properties of these materials.
