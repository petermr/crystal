<p id="Par13">The XRD patterns of hydrated Na-bir and dehydrated Na-bir powder were collected on the 9B HRPD beamline at Pohang Light Source-II (PLS-II) in South Korea. The incident X-ray was vertically collimated using a mirror and monochromatized to a wavelength of 1.4865 Å using a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator. The diffraction patterns were collected in an angular 2
 <italic>θ</italic> range of 10–130° with a step size of 0.02°, while rotating the sample to minimize the preferred orientation effect. The HRPD patterns were calculated using the Fullprof program package to obtain the structural details.
