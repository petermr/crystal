<p>An examination of the densities-of-states (DOS) curves for all sulfides (

 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) shows that the states close to the Fermi levels mostly originate from the M-d as well as S-p atomic orbitals (AOs). More precisely, the M-d states primarily reside in the energy regions around the Fermi levels, while the bands arising from the S-p AOs are located in energy regions below those ranges, which stem from the M-d states. Because a number of bands cross the Fermi level in each sulfide, all of the inspected sulfides should be metals. In the flat band/steep band scenario,

 </sup> one would expect that these atomic orbitals contribute to flat bands as well as steep bands, which cross the Fermi levels of these rock salt-type sulfide-superconductors. Yet, an inspection of the electronic band structures shows that flat bands, which intersect the Γ-point in the electronic band structures of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr), are positioned close to, but not at the Fermi levels in the respective sulfides. Notably, a maximum, which crosses the W-point in the electronic band structure of ZrS, is also located close to, but not at the Fermi level. In the case of LuS, a flat band crosses the Fermi level at the Γ-point. As pointed out by previous research,
 <sup>

 </sup> the absence of flat bands at the Fermi levels in MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr) may lead to a discrepancy between the observed metal-to-superconductor-transitions and an anticipated flat band/steep band scenario. Previous research

 </sup> on the electronic band structures of chalcogenide superconductors existing over certain homogeneity ranges, however, demonstrated that the electronic structures and, furthermore, positions of flat bands relative to the Fermi levels are influenced by the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of the chalcogenides. Indeed, an inspection of the electronic band structures for the metal-deficient M

 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr

 <sub>32</sub> shows that the Fermi levels fall at peaks of the DOS. In this connection, it should also be noted that the presence of flat bands at the Fermi level in a given material is typically related to electronic instabilities (see 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="other">Introduction</xref>) such that the electronic situations encountered for M

 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr

 <sub>32</sub> should be less favorable than those observed for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu). Why, then, should the former sulfides be formed?
