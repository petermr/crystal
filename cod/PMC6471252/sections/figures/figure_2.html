 <caption> Top: a fragment of the infinite Ï€ -stack in the structure of compound 1 a viewed along [001]; crystallographic centers of symmetry indicated as yellow dots; the independent molecule of 1 a in the asymmetric unit represented in grey, the two closest neighbors of 1 a in a stack represented in purple and magenta, with symmetry codes of the molecules on the left; the centers of each pyrene moiety represented as blue dots. Middle and bottom-views perpendicular to the average pyrene planes, roughly along [100], illustrating the vertical overlap of pyrene moieties and the lateral shifts of their centers; the longer interplanar distance (purple) is associated with larger vertical overlap of pyrene fragments. </caption>
