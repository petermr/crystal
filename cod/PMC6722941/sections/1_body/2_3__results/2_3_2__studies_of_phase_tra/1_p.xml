<p>One of the important characteristics of studied nanoparticles is the change in crystallographic characteristics and phase composition as a result of thermal heating. The most credible approach for evaluating these changes is the X-ray phase analysis method. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-f004">Figure 4</xref> represents the dynamics of changes in X-ray diffraction patterns in the annealing process. According to the diffractograms obtained, the samples under study are nanoscale polycrystalline objects, as evidenced by the broadened shape of the diffraction maxima and low intensity.
