<p id="Par8">Microstructural optimization in (Au,Ag)-Si MGMCs was implemented here to design an overall composite color. The apparent uniformity or non-uniformity of the overall color in a composite is controlled by the size scales characterizing the microstructure, such as the average dendrite trunk diameter, arm diameter, arm spacing, interdendritic spacing, etc. The smallest length scale resolvable by the naked human eye is typically on the order of the width of a fine hair, i.e. about 20–30 μm. Hence, microstructural features smaller than 20–30 μm should not be visually resolvable and the overall color of the composite will appear uniform and homogeneous. When this is achieved, the simple rule of mixtures (linear interpolation) can be used to approximate the apparent uniform color of the two-phase MGMC. For a visually-unresolved microstructure, the average CIELAB coordinates of the overall MGMC will be the volume-weighted average of those of the dendrite and matrix phases.</p>
