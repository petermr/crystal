<p>The two samples exhibit a photochromic effect mainly concentrated in the near infrared part of the spectrum for the darkest monoclinic sample, characterized by a low visible DC contrast (about 11.6) but a DR (contrast in the percentage of reflection) at 1200 nm of about 30%. The photochromic behavior is only limited to the visible region (from the total absorption of the infrared part of the spectrum) for the bluest pseudo-cubic sample with a DC visible contrast of about 15. The photo-reduction of some W
 <sup>6+</sup> ions at the origin of the photochromic behavior is then not exclusive to the pseudo-cubic structures. Nevertheless, synthesis conditions allowing the presence of some preexisting W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions and oxygen vacancies are essential for promoting effective photochromic behavior.
