<p>In order to shed some light into this issue, calculations have been performed for the stoichiometric CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> and the hypothetical de-inserted phase Ca
 <sub>0.5</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> (see relevant results in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>). For CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>, the monoclinic and hexagonal models yield similar total energies, with a negligible energy difference of 3 meV/f.u. in favor of the latter (note that the energy difference is within the error range of the calculation). Interestingly, in both cases the optimized structure shows six almost equivalent Ta–N distances excluding the presence of a Jahn–Teller distorted Ta d
 <sup>1</sup> cation. This is in line with detailed band structure calculations,

 <sub>2</sub> the three t
 <sub>2g</sub>-like Ta-based bands are practically degenerate, due to the very regular octahedral coordination for the Ta atoms.
