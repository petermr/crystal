  <p>Supercell length 
   <italic>L</italic> (coloured points) and average number of vacancies per vacancy block 〈
   <italic>N</italic>
   <sub>V</sub>〉 (solid line) as a function of vacancy concentration 
   <italic>x</italic>. Points with the same colour correspond to a series of rational values of α with the same numerator. For example, the bottom series of green points corresponds to α = 1/2 (M0), 1/3 (M33) and 1/4 (M50). Supercells that were used in this study are marked and labelled.
