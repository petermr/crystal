 <caption>
  <p>Schematic view of expected pseudomagnetic field and edge states. 
   <bold>a</bold> Distribution of a pseudomagnetic field induced on the triplon bands. Each solid curve represents a pseudomagnetic field with a fixed 
   <italic>k</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>y</italic>
   </sub> (see Eq. (
   <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">5</xref>) for its definition). 
   <bold>b</bold> Energy spectrum along the 
   <italic>K</italic> direction. The calculation is based on the model presented in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, in which open boundary conditions with 200 sites (100 for each sublattice) are imposed along the 
   <italic>a</italic> direction while periodic boundary conditions are set along the 
   <italic>b</italic> direction. Half of the all modes are shown, and edge states are stressed by a red line for clarity.

   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>6</sub>Cl
   <sub>2</sub> shown as SSH chains coupled by interchain hoppings. The same symbols and lines as those in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> are used. An ellipsoid and a dashed rectangle represent a pair of dimers with a larger hopping amplitudes and a single coupled SSH chain, respectively
