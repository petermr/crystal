<p>Centroid sizes at both the proximal and distal epiphyses showed a strong positive correlation with OSL (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99 and 0.99) (

The Procrustes shape coordinates for the proximal epiphysis indicated that each landmark on the greater and lesser trochanters and femoral head fovea was located in the same position irrespective of OSL groups of fetuses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In comparison, semi-landmarks (FH13), which lined the femoral head, moved in accordance with the increase in OSL. Because FH13 evaluated the form and torsion of the femoral head, these movements might be correlated with the change in âˆ FNA.
