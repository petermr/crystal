<p>To provide further information on the Anh‐B structure, calculations based on the density functional theory were performed using the VASP simulation package (Kresse &amp; Hafner,

Throughout this study, a single cutoff value of 600 eV was used for the plane wave expansion. The first Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst‐Pack grid (Monkhorst &amp; Pack,

 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and determine the elastic constants at a given pressure, we first calculate the equilibrium structure of a unit cell by minimizing the Hellman‐Feynman forces and stresses. Then, the elastic constants are computed by applying strains (magnitude ±1%) and calculating the resulting stress tensor.
