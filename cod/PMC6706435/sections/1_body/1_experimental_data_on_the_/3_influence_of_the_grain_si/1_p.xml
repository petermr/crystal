<p id="Par18">The influence of the grain size at the powder density was especially looked for, but for lower porosity, the effect of the grain size was not expected. At the increase of density during the pressing process, the grains are crushed. This should change the structure of pores significantly comparing with the powder density. Thus, there was no reason to expect the influence of the grain size even at intermediate densities.</p>
