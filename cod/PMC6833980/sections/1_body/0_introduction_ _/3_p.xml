<p>When a perfect crystal is bent with positive strain gradient (strain gradient parameter defined below β &gt; 0), the trajectory of the refracted beam shows a hyperbolic form opening up and some refracted beams return to the entrance surface without reaching the back surface such as

 <sub>m1</sub>, 
 <bold>S</bold>
 <sub>m2</sub> and 
 <bold>S</bold>′
 <sub>m1</sub> in Fig. 1

 <italic>b</italic>), as pointed out by Gronkowski &amp; Malgrange (1984
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> ▸</xref>). These refracted beams are called mirage beams by Authier (2001
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"> ▸</xref>). Fig. 1

 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> to 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> on the dispersion surface. The interference fringes formed by two mirage diffraction beams (IFMD) have been observed by Fukamachi

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> ▸</xref>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb18"> ▸</xref>). It was pointed out by Fukamachi, Jongsukswat

 <italic>et al.</italic> (2012
