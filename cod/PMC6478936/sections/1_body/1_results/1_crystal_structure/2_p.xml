 </sup> arranged in three types of channels along the [001] axis. These channels are connected via common tetrahedra. Two of the channels are empty and solely built up from T1- or T2-tetrahedra. The third type of channel, which hosts the strontium cations, is built up from alternating T1- and T2-tetrahedra. As the strontium cations are located at a centre of inversion, an unprecedented coordination incorporating four nitrogen (Sr–N: 2.760(5) Å) and four oxygen (Sr–O: 2.659(4) Å) atoms is obtained, resulting in a highly symmetrical cube-like coordination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> activator partly replaces Sr
 <sup>2+</sup>, as the ionic radii of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (1.39 Å) and Sr
 <sup>2+</sup> (1.40 Å) are nearly identical
