<p>The values for 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>LLTO–STO</sub> and 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>LLTO–LLTO</sub> are similar, indicating similar favorable interactions that can be explained by their identical perovskite crystal structure. The value for 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>LMO–STO</sub> is significantly lower, indicating reduced wetting behavior for a spinel layer on a perovskite surface. Note that by using these values, the (non)wettability is only implicitly added to the model, which successfully reproduced the wettability for both LLTO and LMO phases on STO surfaces, as shown in

 <sub>LLTO–LLTO</sub> and

 <sub>LMO–STO</sub>, respectively, since similar interactions are expected. The obtained activation energies are used in the KMC simulation to model the VAN formation at different growth temperatures.
