 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref> shows a typical workflow employed in 
 <italic>GIDVis</italic>. Starting from measurements of a polycrystalline powder calibrant with a well known interplanar spacing, the experimental parameters are extracted by comparison of the expected and actual measured peak positions [Fig. 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>a</italic>)]. The obtained calibration parameters are stored and can easily be applied to any other two-dimensional diffraction pattern recorded using the same setup to calculate the reciprocal-space or polar representation.
