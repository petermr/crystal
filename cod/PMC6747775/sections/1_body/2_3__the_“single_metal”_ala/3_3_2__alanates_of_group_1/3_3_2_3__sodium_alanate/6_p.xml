<p>The NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub> dehydrogenation enthalpies are well known (37 and 47 kJ/mol H
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively, Ti-doped) [
 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These values mainly indicate a kinetic restrain for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, rather than a thermodynamic difficulty (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec7-materials-12-02724">Section 7</xref> for details on dehydrogenation enthalpies). A phase diagram NaH + Al/Na

Since the work of BogdanoviÄ‡, literally, thousands of papers have been published about different catalysts, variations in compositions or variations of the synthesis procedure [
