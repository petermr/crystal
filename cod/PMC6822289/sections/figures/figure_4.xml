  <p>AA and AB stacking for (a) 05000N2 and (b) 05001N2, as reported in the experimental reference,
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
   </sup> are compared. Conventional names are COF-1 and COF-5, respectively. In that report, the assessment of the presumed stacking was done by generating for both COFs the AA configuration and reasonable AB configurations, and comparing the computed XRD with the experimental PXRD.
