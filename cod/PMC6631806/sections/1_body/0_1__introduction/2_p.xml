<p>The simplest molten AB diblock copolymers have exhibited 1-dimensional lamellar layers, 2-dimensional hexagonal cylinders with P6/mm, body-centered cubic (BCC) spheres with Im3m symmetry, double gyroids belonging to Ia3d space group, and an orthorhombic Fddd network morphology [

 <xref rid="B12-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Molten ABC triblock copolymers with one additional component give more diversified morphologies due to the increase in the degree of freedom [

 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the morphologies reported so far are still limited for block copolymer systems. It seems that there are still many morphologies unexplored in block copolymers, as we recognize the emergence of the discontinuous mesophases with Pm3n (A15) and P4
