<p>High activities against ABTS were reported for macrocyclic binuclear metal complexes: IC

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These complexes are inhibitors as powerful as ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.9 ± 0.5 µM), although the inhibitory capacities are moderate when compared with glutathione (&lt;12.5 µM) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (&lt;12.5 µM). The binuclear core may be one of the factors for the efficiency, as suggested by the lower activities of the L14 complexes.
