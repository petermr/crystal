<p id="Par6">To provide a vivid illustration of the degenerate phenomenon, the 3D dispersion surface for the first and second bands are plotted. The band structure for the super cell of the underlying Hermitian acoustic system (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0) is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>. We observe a degenerate contour of frequency eigenvalues along the line of

  <italic>x</italic>

 <italic>π</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> in the band structure because of the fold features in the super cell system. When the gain and loss are added to form a non-Hermitian system with a coefficient 
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.25, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref> shows that the degenerate contours at the band crossing instantaneously experience thresholdless spontaneous 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry breaking. A particularly interesting phenomenon occurs, where the folded bands merge together outwards from the primary degenerate contour, and a new contour appears at the boundary between the merged and the independent regions. Thus, degeneracy in 3D 
 <bold>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </bold>-space is exhibited as bands merging in a continuous area, which includes high-symmetry points and arbitrary low-symmetry points. Due to the extra spatial degree of freedom, the degenerate points in the 1D structure evolve into an irregular contour in the 2D system. A comparison of data values also shows that the bands nearly flatten in the x direction perpendicular to the degenerate contour after they merge. The imaginary part, as presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref>, contains identical degenerate contour and forms complex conjugate pairs of frequencies with the real components.
