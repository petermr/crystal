<p id="Par5">Experimental details are in the “Methods” section. Total X-ray scattering data from a highly stoichiometric sample of magnetite were recorded from 90 to 923 K. Representative scattering intensity

 <sub>V</sub> is a Verwey shift parameter that describes the set of constrained structural displacements, such that

 <sub>V</sub> = 0 corresponds to the cubic spinel structure without any local distortions and 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>V</sub> = 1 describes the full magnitude of distortions in the 90 K magnetite superstructure

 <sub>V</sub> were determined at each temperature by fitting the structural model to three successive regions of the PDF corresponding approximately to distances from atoms to their neighbours in the same unit cell (First Unit Cell range, covering all interatomic distances for
