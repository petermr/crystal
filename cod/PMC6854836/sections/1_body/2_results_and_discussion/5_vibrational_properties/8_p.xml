 <sub>2.5</sub> ground-state configuration and β-SiB

 </xref>. Modes at highest wavenumber involve exclusively boron atoms. The localized nature of the modes associated with Si–Si stretch and Si
 <sub>4</sub> breathing in β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> manifest as spikes in the pDOS. Their location is well reproduced in the calculations. The pDOS of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> shows states between 500 and 600 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, 750 and 850 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, and at 950 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> where there are gaps in the Raman spectrum. Selection rules are not applicable for disordered α-SiB
 <sub>3–

 </sub>, and its Raman spectrum resembles an envelope of the pDOS.
