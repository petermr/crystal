<p>Due to the challenges in material preparation and experimental conditions, the nature of the physical phenomena at the atomic level is still elusive. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been recognized as a reliable method for mechanism investigations [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including studying the creep process of nanomaterials and elucidating the creep mechanisms. For instance, through MD simulation, Keblinski et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggest that the Coble creep mechanism plays a major role during the creep deformation of nanocrystalline materials (grain size â‰¤10 nm). Yamakov et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have investigated grain boundary diffusion in the creep process of nanocrystalline palladium at elevated temperatures. They have reported that grain boundary sliding may serve as an accommodation mechanism for grain boundary diffusion creep. Besides this, Millett et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have studied the diffusional creep in nanocrystalline molybdenum. Their MD simulation results indicate that the overall deformation is dominated by grain boundary diffusion and lattice diffusion, and vacancies are found to be generated from the grain boundaries into the grain interiors. Additionally, their findings reveal that lattice diffusion represents one of the most important mechanisms underlying creep. Despite the inherent limitation of high strain rates, the underlying creep mechanisms can be identified by MD simulations at a specific timescale. Previous simulation results have shown good agreement with phenomenological models and experimental data [
