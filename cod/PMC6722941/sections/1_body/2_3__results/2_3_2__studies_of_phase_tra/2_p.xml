<p>According to the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained, the phase composition of the initial nanoparticles was determined. As is known, in the case of a chemical method for producing nanoparticles based on iron salts, the preferred form of nanoparticle formation is the X-ray amorphous phase of magnetite iron oxide Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, which is formed as an outcome of chemical reactions. However, the addition of cerium nitrate to the initial solution leads to the creation of a crystalline phase in the structure. It was established that the structure of initial nanoparticles is characteristic of the cubic phase of cerium oxide CeO
 <sub>2</sub>, which confirms measurements of the atomic ratio of components in the structure. The low intensity, as well as the broadened and asymmetrical shape of diffraction maxima for the original nanoparticles, is a consequence of the presence of amorphous-like inclusions of iron oxide in the structure. That corresponds to low-intensity and highly asymmetric peaks in the region of 50–70° and a high oxygen share in the structure. A growth in the temperature of annealing gives rise to an increase in intensities and a narrowing of the diffraction maxima. That indicates a drop in contributions of amorphous inclusions and an increase in the degree of structure ordering. 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> represents the outcome of the evaluation of the phase composition during heat treatment. Evaluation of alterations in the phase composition in the structure of nanoparticles was conducted using the Rietveld method. The determination of volume fraction of the phase contribution was conducted with the use of Formula (1):
