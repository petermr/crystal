<p id="p0165">There is no doubt, that in the first step, weakly physisorbed water is removed from the surface. According to the literature data [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the following steps might correspond to the appearance and disappearance of the intermediate phase R2 in the form of water clusters. PLS NCN0.25 located on the phase diagram of the system near the boundary between the perovskite structure and layered phases, has the unique ability to adsorb water from the air. In Na

 <sub>32</sub>, water is absorbed, the oxygen is embedded in the lattice, and as a result a new layered compound appears with a larger thickness of the perovskite layer. Such chemical activity of the structure can lead to various anomalies of the physical properties of the compounds formed in the (1-
