  <p>(a) Top-view and (b) cross-sectional SEM images of a nanocomposite thin film composed of LMO pillars embedded in an LLTO matrix. (c) X-ray diffraction analysis of the VAN film, in which LLTO peaks are shown by ◆, LMO peaks by ■, and STO substrate peaks by *, whereas minor contributions of the tetragonal LLTO phase are indicated by ◇. (d) Cross-sectional energy selective backscattered scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image showing the compositional contrast.</p>
