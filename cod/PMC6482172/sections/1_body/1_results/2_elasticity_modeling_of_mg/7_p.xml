<p id="Par21">Using the above elasticity model, the total energy due to the dislocation-jog interactions and the jog self formation is calculated. The parameter 
 <italic>α</italic> in the self energy expression is not exactly defined or calculated from other sources. Indeed, the self energy term is only approximately correct since the expression in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="">11</xref>) is derived from an isolated segment of straight dislocation

 </sup> while in the jog case here, corner effects would also contribute. For MgO, a value for 
 <italic>α</italic> of 5.6 leads to the elasticity model prediction of the jog formation energy ranging from 0.10 eV to −0.05 eV depending on the jog width (3.0 Å–33 Å). This is in good agreement with the atomistic modeling result (taking the lowest formation energy value of 0.03 eV from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with energy difference &lt;0.1 eV.
