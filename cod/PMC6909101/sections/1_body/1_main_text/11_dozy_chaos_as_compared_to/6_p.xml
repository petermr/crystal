<p id="p0750">As is clear from the foregoing, the concept of quantum chaos is constructed, by definition, so as to preserve the standard paradigm of quantum mechanics and not to seek a review of its basis in connection with the inclusion of chaos in quantum dynamics. Vice versa, the concept of dozy chaos is constructed, by definition, in such a way that requires a revision of the basis of quantum mechanics, to incorporate the chaotic and classical in nature dynamics into the transient state of molecular quantum transitions.</p>
