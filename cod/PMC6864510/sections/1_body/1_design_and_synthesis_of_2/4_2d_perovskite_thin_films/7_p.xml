 <sub>+1</sub>, a hierarchical structure with 2D perovskite on a 3D perovskite film.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">67</xref> The growth mechanism of this hierarchical structure is a spatially limited nucleation of the nanosheets on 3D perovskite film, due to the respective concentration of BAI and MAI and their ratio. Especially, the vertical growth of perovskite nanosheets on a thin film is closely related to the concentration gradient of BAI as shown in Figure
