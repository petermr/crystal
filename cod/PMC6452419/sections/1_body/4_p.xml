<p>Noncovalent interactions and bonding patterns are then directly compared using the integral of the electron density (DORI(

  <xref rid="eq3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>
 </xref>, the size and even the number of DORI basins directly depends on the chosen

 <italic>f</italic>, for instance, results in the merging of previously distinct domains. This type of behavior has been rationalized by Savin and Marx,

 </sup> and biologically relevant
