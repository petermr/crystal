<p>The stability in time of the perovskite layers was measured by monitoring UVâ€“vis spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) after two weeks under ambient conditions and without encapsulation. XRD measurements were performed to investigate the introduction of Zn(II) in the perovskite lattice. The morphology and energy-dispersive system spectra of the films were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Steady-state PL was measured with a home-built setup equipped with a 485 nm continuous-wave laser as the source of excitation (Pico Quant LDH-D-C-640) at a power output of 1 mW. Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements were performed with a home-built setup equipped with a 485 nm pulsed laser (PicoQuant LDH-D-C-640) with a repetition rate of 0.1 MHz.</p>
