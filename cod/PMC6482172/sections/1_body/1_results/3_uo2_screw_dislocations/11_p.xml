<p id="Par33">In conclusion, a systematic study of vacancy dissociation at screw dislocations in MgO is presented. The important role of stress migration in the atomistic modeling is identified, which corrects earlier results

 </sup>. A reasonable agreement between the elasticity model including the electrostatic contribution and the atomistic results with stress correction is reached. Given the small energy penalty in the jog formation, it is suggested that the jog formation events in the MD simulations are driven mainly by entropy, a consequence of the almost identical cancellation of elastic attraction by electrostatic repulsion. Both atomistic study and elasticity analysis also suggest that the mechanism of vacancy dissociation through jog formation is not limited to rocksalt-structured materials, and can be extended to more complicated lattices such as UO
 <sub>2</sub>. In fact, the mechanism is more likely in a material such as UO
 <sub>2</sub>. In this case, the jog formation events are driven by a reduction in energy in addition to the entropic contribution.
