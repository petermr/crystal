<p id="Par24">The chiral dopants (CB15, Me-
 <bold>m</bold>, or Ph-
 <bold>m</bold>) were weighed in glass vials and then the desired volume of nematic liquid crystal 5CB was added. The contents of the vial were heated above the isotropization temperature, where the opaque material becomes transparent. The isotropic mixture was stirred at 40Â°C and was cooled down to room temperature.
