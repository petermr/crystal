<p>The cubic structure of PVO can be considered as a special case of ideal tetragonal perovskite with 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> = 1. The ferroelectric polarization is very sensitive to structural parameters. So, to calculate the 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio for various compositions accurately, we have calculated the total energy as a function of 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic>. We have performed this calculation with a 1 × 1 × 2 supercell, which means we should get a minimum energy for 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> = 2 for a cubic system. Consistent with this, our 
 <italic>E</italic> ∼ 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> graph (see

 <italic>x</italic> = 0) shows a minimum energy for 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> = 2 for the paraelectric phase, whereas for the ferroelectric phase, we get a noninteger 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic>. To find the possible polarization path, we have calculated the total energy as a function of Pb displacement with respect to V/Ti–O polyhedra.

 </xref> helps us to find the easiest path of the ferroelectric polarization and the role of Pb ions in the tetragonal distortion. We have plotted the displacement of Pb ion with respect to VO
 <sub>5</sub> pyramid along the [111] and [001] directions. The energy versus displacement curves for both the directions have double-well shapes. It can be seen that the lowest energy for the off-center displacements is along the [001] direction. It shows that the ferroelectric properties are greatly effected by the polarizability of Pb. The energy difference between the two directions is very small (about 2 meV/f.u.) compared to well-known multiferroic BiFeO

 </sup> So, in principle, the Curie temperature of PVO must be less than that of BiFeO
 <sub>3</sub>. However, the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> for PVO has not been estimated yet, as it decomposes before reaching to its paraelectric phase. But the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> of PbTi
 <sub>0.9</sub>V
 <sub>0.1</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> was estimated to be 823 K by Pan et al.,

 </sup> and it showed an increasing trend V concentration (measured

 <sub>0.8</sub>V
 <sub>0.2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and PbTi
 <sub>0.7</sub>V
