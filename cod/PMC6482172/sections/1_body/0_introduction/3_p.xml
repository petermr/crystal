 </sup>, although a simpler picture (pair of jogs) was observed in the atomistic simulations. That work also developed an analytical model of the behavior of dissociated vacancies at dislocations, based on elasticity and electrostatics. The agreement between the model and the atomistic calculations in ionic rocksalt compounds (MgO, BaO, and NaCl) was found to be only qualitative, reproducing the basic trend but not the actual magnitude of the interactions. In the current work, we present a more systematic study of the problem. By focusing on MgO, we identify the important role of stress migration (as defined later) in the atomistic modeling study, which was neglected in our previous work
