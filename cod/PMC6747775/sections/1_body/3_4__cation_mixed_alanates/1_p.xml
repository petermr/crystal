<p>Cation substitution has demonstrated utility in the tailoring of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties in borohydrides [

 <xref rid="B266-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. A similar approach has been applied to alanates, for which LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> or NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> are frequently used as starting materials due to their reactivity. These alanates react with other metal hydrides to form mixed cation alanates. The reactions can be generalized as [
