<p>Under 358 nm excitation, the IQE of the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample was measured using an integrating sphere, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>a, which could be calculated by the following equation

 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>S</sub> is the emission spectrum of the sample; and 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>S</sub> and 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>R</sub> are the spectra of the excitation light with the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample and only with BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> reference, respectively. Thus, the calculated IQE was 44%, which was higher than that of the recently reported Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>-activated red-emitting phosphors, such as Mg
 <sub>7</sub>Ga
 <sub>2</sub>GeO
 <sub>12</sub>:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> (IQE: 28.13%), La(MgTi)
 <sub>1/2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> (IQE: 27.2%), and SrLaScO
 <sub>4</sub>:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> (IQE: 12.2%).

 <italic>x</italic>Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors using the same integrating sphere method. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>b, the IQE values of BGT:
 <italic>x</italic>Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %) under 358 nm excitation were calculated to be about 62, 52, 44, 41, 32, and 24%, respectively.
