 <caption> Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDX) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analyses of SALON. a Qualitative false-colour representation of the lateral distribution of the elements Sr, Al, O, and N. b Qualitative false-colour representation of the lateral distribution of the elements Li and Cu for a Sr[Li 2Al 2O 2N 2]:Eu 2+ phosphor particle that has been placed into a pocket of a copper transmission electron microscopy grid with 50 µm mesh width. c Time of flight mass spectrometry depth profile of the Li + secondary ions signal intensities in Sr[LiAl 3N 4] and Sr[Li 2Al 2O 2N 2], divided by the respective signal intensities of the Sr + secondary ions. Below the particle surface, the normalized signal intensities approach a linear level (further details are provided in the Method section) </caption>
