<p>To validate their identities as 2′-dG riboswitches, we first verified the 2′-deoxyguanosine binding ability of several 2′-dG-II class RNAs using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The 
 <italic>env23</italic> sequence (RNA nomenclature adopted from Weinberg 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)) used to determine the ligand binding specificity of this class was observed to bind 2′-dG with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>D,app</sub> of 290 ± 50 nM (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), consistent with in-line probing values (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, we investigated a sequence (
 <italic>env1</italic>) from the sequence alignment of this class of riboswitches that most closely resembled the 
 <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch, particularly with respect to the terminal loop-loop (L2–L3) interaction (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Prior structural studies using the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine aptamer to host alternative ligand binding pockets in the three-way junction revealed that these RNAs, like the parental sequence, were readily crystallizable (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref>). 2′-dG binding by 
 <italic>env1</italic> was determined by ITC to be 34 ± 1 nM (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), less than an order of magnitude weaker than the ∼4 nM binding affinity of 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch for guanine (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
