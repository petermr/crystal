<p>The most common physicochemical characterization techniques for hydrogen storage materials, and thus alanates, are X-ray diffraction (in-situ, ex-situ, with synchrotron or conventional X-ray sources), and spectroscopies, such as Infrared and Raman. Other vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS), Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering Spectroscopy (NRIXS), or Photoacoustic (PA) Infrared Spectroscopy are far less widespread. The main results of X-ray diffraction studies were presented along with the description of each alanate. Thus, we did not include a special section for it. On the other hand, the characterization of alanates by IR and Raman Spectroscopies is also frequently used due to the relatively low cost of equipment and the relative simplicity of sample preparation for such tests. Therefore, we present IR and Raman spectroscopies in this review. </p>
