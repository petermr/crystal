<p>Crystals of the aptamer domain of the 
 <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II class riboswitch in complex with 2′-deoxyguanosine were obtained in the P4
 <sub>1</sub>22 space group and diffracted using a home source rotating copper anode x-rays to 2.8 Å resolution (crystallographic data and model refinement statistics provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The structure was determined by molecular replacement (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) using the three helices of the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch RNA as an initial search model (PDB ID: 4FE5, (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)), as described in the methods. The initial electron density map (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) was sufficiently clear to build the remaining RNA and the model was further built and refined using PHENIX (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The final model had
