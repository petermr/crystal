<p id="Par41">A WLED was fabricated by coating blue-emitting Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> powder and orange-emitting Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs onto a commercially available 365 nm LED chip (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, two obvious peaks can be seen from the EL spectrum of the WLED, which attribute to Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub>. The perseverance of these two peaks indicates that no anion exchange and other chemical reactions occur in the fabrication process. In bright white light with color coordinates of (0.334, 0.297), the correlated color temperature of 5311 K can be observed when the WLED is operated at 15 mA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b and c). The highest luminous efficiency and luminance of the WLED reach up to 20.8 lm/W and 78,000 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively, which are comparable with other UV chip-based WLEDs [
