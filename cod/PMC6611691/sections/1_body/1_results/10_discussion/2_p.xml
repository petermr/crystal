<p>Crucially, the angular momentum quantization axis for the dark excitons is the 
 <italic>z</italic> axis of the local coordination system shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and indicated by the purple arrows in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A to C</xref>. Any component of the 
 <italic>B</italic>-field perpendicular to this quantization axis will lead to a mixing of the 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xz</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>d
  <sub>yz</sub>
 </italic> orbitals. This breaks the conservation of angular momentum, thereby admixing bright (via electron-hole recombination) and dark excitons and opening up their fast decay channel. Once the dark exciton—the essential building block of the Wigner crystal—acquires a finite lifetime, the crystal itself must melt. Ultimately, it is this melting of the excitonic order that suppresses the additional Umklapp process below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>, giving rise to the negative MR and restoring the metallic state in the presence of a strong magnetic field (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>). Since the crystal melting is strongly influenced by the angular offset between the magnetic field vector and the quantization axis, this model provides a natural explanation for the location of 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub> at θ = θ
 <sub>CR</sub> and the resulting asymmetric MR response; with decreasing temperature, the unique angular dependence is determined by the orientation of the 
 <italic>B</italic>-field with respect to the quantization axis rather than to the main reciprocal axes of the lattice.
