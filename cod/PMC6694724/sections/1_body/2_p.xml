<p>However, the biggest challenge in Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn and its related compounds is the formation of single crystals, which is complicated by a high-temperature cubic austenite to tetragonal martensitic structural transition, a well-known phenomenon for shape memory alloys.

 </sup> Therefore, conventional crystal growth techniques always result in microtwinned crystals. In this manuscript, we show that under certain reaction conditions large micro-twin-free single crystals of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn can be grown, which is essential for establishing the intrinsic features of antiskyrmions in this compound. Micro-twin-free single crystals allow us to determine the structure of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), which leads to the discovery of the first known superstructure of a Heusler compound originating from Mn-vacancy ordering. The additional tetragonality due to the formation of the superstructure can have favorable effects for the stability of antiskyrmions in Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn and many other related compounds.
