<p>The water molecules among the TOT (Tetrahedron-Octahedron-Tetrahedron) crystal layers are added by the Adsorption Location module. Since the amount of water molecules in the interlayers can affect the interlayer spacing of the montmorillonite, when the montmorillonite contains a layer of water molecules, the layer spacing is about 12.5 Å, and the two layers are about 15.0 Å [

 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer, this paper used the established 8a × 4b × 1c super-cell to simulate. Two-hundred-and-fifty-six water molecules were added into the montmorillonite model to form two layers of water molecules, and the corresponding Ca–montmorillonite layer spacing was 15.0 Å [

Corresponding to four types of Ca–montmorillonites with different charge densities, five different ion substitution modes and substitution ratios, twenty montmorillonite hydration models were finally established (taking M1 as an example, as shown in
