 <caption> ( a) Schematic view of a single PbS nanoparticle with the shape of a truncated cube with six 100 and eight 111 facets, and the chemical structure of the tetrathiafulvalenedicarboxylate (TTFDA) anion; ( b) Structure of a mesocrystal formed by PbS nanoparticles crosslinked with TTFDA molecules; ( c) Scheme of the diffraction experiment, in which small angle scattering from the mesocrystal superlattice and wide angle scattering from PbS atomic scattering were recorded simultaneously by a large 2D detector.
