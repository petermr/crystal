<p>The spatial orientation of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H chemical shielding tensors of all four protons of malonic acid [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and of the two protons involved in hydrogen bonding in maleic acid [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], was established experimentally. In each case an orientation of these tensors in the molecular frame follows the pattern of (1) the most shielded component almost collinear with the H–X bond vector (X is either O or C); (2) the mid-shielded component approximately perpendicular to the H–X bond while lying close to a plane formed by the H, X, and the nearest heteroatom; and (3) the least shielded component in the direction approximately perpendicular to that plane. This pattern was confirmed by the PW DFT calculations and is analyzed in detail in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01731">Supplementary Information</xref> in terms of the reference vectors associated with the local geometry of the hydrogens of malonic acid. Regarding numerical values, Haeberlen et al. reported for all the carboxylic protons of malonic and maleic acids an angle of 8° ± 2° between the most shielded direction of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H chemical shielding tensor and the line between the oxygens of the corresponding hydrogen bond [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This result is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of 7°, 9°, 5°, and 12° obtained using the PBE functional respectively for protons denoted as H1 and H2 in both structures [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is only a mild dependence of these values on the choice of the DFT functional: They accordingly amount to 8°, 11°, 4°, and 13° when computed with the revPBE. In addition, the parameters of the theory-to-experiments fits are fairly similar for the two functionals (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01731-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the periodic DFT computations can be expected to quantitatively reproduce the results of the SC 
 <sup>1</sup>H SSNMR measurements of the chemical shielding tensors’ orientations, and to provide the eigenvalues with the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of about 1.0 ppm in the linear regression model.
