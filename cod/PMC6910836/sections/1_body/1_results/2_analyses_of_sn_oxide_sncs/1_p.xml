<p>Sn oxide SNCs were prepared by our original synthetic technique to allow direct spectroscopic observation (

 </xref>). In this technique, the potential gradient properties of dendrimer molecules induce the stepwise accumulation of metal complexes from the inner generation layers toward the outer generation layers during the titration of metal salts (fig. S3). Each respective layer consists of 4, 8, 16, and 32 imine sites, and a gradual multistep accumulation process allows the formation of stable monodispersed complexes containing 4, 12 (=4 + 8), 28 (=12 + 16), and 60 (=28 + 32) metal atoms, respectively (

 <sub>4</sub>, analysis by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) found that the sizes of the Sn
 <sub>12</sub>, Sn
 <sub>28</sub>, and Sn
 <sub>60</sub> oxide SNCs were 0.9 ± 0.2 nm, 1.0 ± 0.2 nm, and 1.8 ± 0.3 nm, respectively (fig. S4). The sizes observed in these STEM images agree with the trends determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and demonstrate the obvious effect of the amount of SnCl
 <sub>2</sub> added to the DPA-PTM-G4 molecules (fig. S4, D to F).
