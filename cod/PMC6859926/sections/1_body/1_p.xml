<p>Early reports revealed that LB-100 acts as a catalytic inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2AC: encoded by 
 <italic>PPP2CA/PPP2CB</italic>). More recently, LB-100 was shown to also target PPP5C, inhibiting PP2AC and PPP5C with similar potency (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.4 and 1.8 μM for PP2AC and PPP5C, respectively) [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To determine the molecular basis for catalytic inhibition, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of PPP5C in the presence of LB-100 at a resolution of 1.65 Å, which revealed clear electron density for the 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarbonyl moiety, with the 2,3-dicarbonyl of LB-100 coordinating with both catalytic metals (M1 and M2). In order to accommodate the inhibitor, the side chains of Arg275 and Tyr451 adopt alternate conformations in relation to the active site metals, and the O7 bridgehead oxygen replaces the water molecule, which would otherwise coordinate with metal ion, M2. This causes the inhibitor to be tightly coordinated within the catalytic pocket, blocking substrate access to the catalytic metals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, in our high-resolution structure [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there is no density for the 3-(4-methyl-1-piperazine) ring, suggesting that either this region is flexible and does not contribute to binding, or that the methylpiperazine ring is labile in a biological setting. If the ring is released, then a metabolite (LB100M: 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid; also called endothall) represents the biologically active compound. Assessment of LB100M levels in plasma and tumor tissue will be determined shortly, as they are secondary outcomes in an ongoing Phase II trial (NCT03027388).
