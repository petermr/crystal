<p>The elastic constants calculated above can be used to assess the seismic properties of Anh‐B. At 0 K and 15 GPa, Anh‐B displays moderate seismic anisotropy (Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), which is lower than the intrinsic anisotropy of olivine and wadsleyite (Mainprice, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). However, the geometry of anisotropy is similar to that of wadsleyite (Mainprice, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The maximum 
 <italic>P</italic> wave anisotropy is 7%, with the fastest 
 <italic>P</italic> waves propagating parallel to [010] and the slowest, parallel to [001].
