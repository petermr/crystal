<p id="Par20">It is worth noting that the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>f</sub> value is lower than the CRI (
 <italic>Ra</italic>) value in all the LED PKGs because the TM-30 standard uses 99 color samples, whereas CIE

 </sub>. Finally, the long term stability and reliability of the newly designed PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LED was tested under various test environments. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> shows the reliability data. We tested the thermal stability/ reliability of the LEDs by keeping it ON at 298 K, 378 K, and 378 K, 85% humidity for 1000 h. The emission intensity was 99.7% of the initial value even after 1000 h of operation. Besides, we tested the sample under 378 K, and a current of 180 mA was applied to measure the change of the luminous flux up to 1000 h, and the luminous emission intensity of 99.6% of the initial emission intensity was maintained even after 1000 h of continuous operation. Finally, the PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LED was kept in a chamber having a temperature of 378 K and a humidity of 85%, and the durability under stress conditions was confirmed. The PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LED exhibited a high luminous intensity of 95.5% of the initial emission intensity, suggesting that the fabricated LEDs are highly reliable and durable even under stress conditions.
