<p id="Par4">In this work, we show that band splitting with vanishing spin polarizations (BSVSP) in acentric nonmagnetic materials, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The group theory analysis indicates that the band splitting arises from the breaking of inversion symmetry and the vanishing spin polarization (i.e., the expectation value of spin evaluated over each Bloch wavefunction) is due to the presence of additional symmetries. We demonstrate in details why BSVSP is possible and how to achieve it in two prototypical examples, namely bulk GaAs and two-dimensional ferroelectric SnTe, complementing the symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations.
