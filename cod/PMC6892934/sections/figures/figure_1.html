 <caption> ( a) SEM micrographs of the nano-indent made with a 4.2 µm radius spherical indenter tip in the unimplanted part of sample and ( b) SEM of two indents made in the helium-implanted part of sample. The X, Y and Z axes applies to both ( a) and ( b). ( c) Load versus displacement curve for the unimplanted and helium-implanted tungsten sample as obtained from nano-indentation and predicted by CPFE. ( d) TEM micrographs of a FIB-lift-out cross-section from the indent-centre in the implanted sample, showing the presence of slip channels beneath the indent. The inset in ( d) shows a close-up of the slip channel and depicts the diffuse boundary between the channel and the surrounding matrix. The green cube represents the crystal orientation of the TEM lamella, also indicated by red (X axis) and black (Z axis) arrows showing the same coordinate frame as in ( a). </caption>
