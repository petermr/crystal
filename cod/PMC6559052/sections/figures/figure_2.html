 <caption> Comparison of experimental CTRs for TiO 2(011)-(2 × 1) (bottom curve, black error bars) and TiO 2(011)/H 2O (top curve, blue error bars), respectively. Both are indexed using the same (1 × 1) unit cell for ease of comparison. For data analysis, the TiO 2(011)-(2 × 1) dataset was re-indexed as (2*H,K). CTRs are offset for clarity. Red lines on X-axis indicate the anti-Bragg regions. </caption>
