 <caption>
  <p>The preparation steps of ZnO nanospike cross-sections using the geometric shadow-FIB technique. (
   <italic>a</italic>) (Left) As-grown ZnO nanospikes from a Zn spherical particle. (Right) Amorphous carbon was deposited via electron-beam-induced decomposition to embed the spikes in a matrix material. (
   <italic>b</italic>) The first step of FIB trench milling and the lift-out process. (
   <italic>c</italic>) The rotated (180Â°) specimen was milled with a Ga ion beam using the silicon substrate as protection against severe damage to the carbon matrix. (
   <italic>d</italic>) An ion-milled lamella with electron-beam-transparent cross-section specimens (red circles).
