<p>The upper and lower levels were defined in each of the two optimization cycles that were done in this work. Once the levels of variables were set, the experimental matrix was defined (see 
 <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="other">8</xref>
 </xref>). As 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2, the total number of experiments to be done was 4.
