<p>The most significant difference between the 2′-dG-II and other purine riboswitches within the three-way junction is a two nucleotide insertion in J3/1 that is absent in both the guanine/adenine and 2′-dG-I classes of purine riboswitches (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>). This insertion is present in all members of the 2′-dG-II class, with the first position being an invariant uridine nucleotide while the second nucleotide is variable. In the crystal structure of 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II), this insertion element promotes new base-base interactions within the three-way junction. U75 forms a base pair with the Hoogsteen face of A24 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch this nucleotide is unpaired and stacks with the bottom of the P3 helix while the equivalent nucleotide in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I) forms a base triple with the junction-proximal base pair in P2. The second nucleotide of the insertion, C76, is flipped away from the junction such that it does not make contacts with other bases in the RNA. Supporting this observation, mutation of C76 to a guanosine has minimal effect on 2′-dG binding affinity, reducing it only 2.9-fold (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
