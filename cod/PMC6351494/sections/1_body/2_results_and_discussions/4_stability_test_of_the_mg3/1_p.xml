<p>Since the XPS results only provide the composition and the oxidation state of the elements, here we investigated the stability of the passivation layer on the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> by storing them in ambient atmosphere and water. The XRD patterns of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> do not show any changes during the initial 24 h storage in air as shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>. It indicates the surfaces of the particles were well passivated. Subsequently we added 0.05 ml of water per sample holder, containing ~0.5 g of the powder sample. Immediately a new peak corresponding to the 012 reflection of bismuth appeared at 27.4° of 2
 <italic>θ</italic> as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>. Though no diffraction peaks corresponding to Mg(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> are observed, the formation of the bismuth suggests the hydrolysis of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> in the following Equation (1).
