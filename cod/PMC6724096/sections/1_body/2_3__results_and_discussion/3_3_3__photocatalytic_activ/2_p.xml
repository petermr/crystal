 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f010">Figure 10</xref>b compares the photocatalytic properties of the prepared pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> with commercial P25 as a control. The degradation rates of P25 and pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> were 56.2% and 55.4%, respectively, because the electron and holes of pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> were easily combined and rendered inefficient. The two crystal phases of P25 transferred some electrons between the two phases, thus exhibiting slightly higher efficiency than pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. When Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> was doped, the efficiency was greatly improved. The degradation efficiencies of Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> with Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> at 0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0% were 89.9%, 95.7%, 90.5% and 74.1%, respectively. This is due to the beneficial effect of iron doping on the formation of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, which leads to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.
