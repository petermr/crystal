<p>The PDs were attached to a glass substrate using a double-sided tape that was then mounted into a flow cell where the photolysis was effected under streaming helium or medical-grade air (SI

 </sup> The NO released from the sample was transferred from the cell via the flowing gas to the NOA, where it was detected and quantified. The visible photoexcitation source was the royal blue (451 nm) Luxeon LED operating in the 45â€“500 mW range. The NIR photoexcitation source (794 nm) was a Sheaupac NIR fiber-coupled diode laser module from ILX Lightwave. Incident photon flux during photolysis was measured using a Newport model 8442 PE optical power meter with a silicon photodiode detector. The photolysis laser beam (0.8 mm diameter) was oscillated by reflecting of two movable mirrors controlled by a Tektronix AFG320 arbitrary function digital generator, as described previously (SI

 </sup> The two mirrors each control the scanning width in one direction (horizontal or vertical) so that adjusting the individual oscillating frequencies defines the size of the scanned area. Experiments were run with mirror frequencies of 78.93 and 48.93 Hz, which scanned the collimated laser beam over most of the 10 mm diameter PDs to compensate for inhomogeneities in Nd-UCNP distribution in the polymer matrices while avoiding the damage that sometimes occurred when focusing on a single spot.
