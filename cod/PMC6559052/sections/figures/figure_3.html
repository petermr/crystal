 <caption> Ball and stick model of the local OH geometry for the optimized TiO 2(011)/H 2O substrate, indicating values for the bond angle and distance from best-fit structural parameters derived from SXRD. The atom color scheme and labels are the same as Figure 1 . The large black atoms are oxygen atoms associated with OH. </caption>
