 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) shows the RDF between O
 <sub>t</sub> and H
 <sub>w</sub> in the interlayer with different charge densities, which indicates that as the layer charge density increased, the intensity of the first main peak of g(O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) gradually increased. The reason was that the polarity of the Siâ€“O surface increases with the increase in the charge density of the montmorillonite, and the H
 <sub>w</sub> was pulled by a stronger polar force when the layer charge was higher; therefore, the first main peak of g(O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) gradually increased with an increase in the layer charge density. This further demonstrates that the diffusivity of water molecules among the layers of montmorillonite decreased as the layer charge density increased.
