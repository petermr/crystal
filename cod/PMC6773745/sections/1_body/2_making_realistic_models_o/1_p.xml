<p id="Par6">At face value, we now find ourselves with a powerful—if computationally and experimentally demanding—tool capable of determining the structures of materials of perhaps arbitrary complexity. If this approach proves robust, it could provide unparalleled insight into the microscopic nature of all sorts of complex systems: examples include battery materials, biominerals, photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and heterogeneous catalysts. As systems become trickier and trickier to characterise, we might simply add to our modelling algorithm more and more data sets of increasing quality and increasingly diverse sensitivity. Even for the case of PMN, one might eventually wish to include small-angle scattering, three-dimensional pair distribution function (3D-PDF) and/or spectroscopic measurements.</p>
