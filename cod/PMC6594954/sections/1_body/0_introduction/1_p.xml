 </sup>, their structure and chemical bonding became a focus of a number of recent experimental and theoretical studies. Small atomic radius and high ionization energy of beryllium make covalent interactions playing the important role in stabilizing beryllium compounds, unlike other alkaline-earth elements. In contrast to MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, at ambient conditions BeO crystallizes in the hexagonal wurtzite structure, featuring tetrahedrally coordinated Be
