<p>In addition, the PL peak position set at 1.55 eV does not show a substantial shift for all the compositions except for the one containing only the film-forming agent 3-CPACl which shows a peak at 1.56 eV. Although it is not a significant shift, this might be due to the presence of a small amount of chloride in the crystal lattice. The improved stability, as a result of noteworthy improvement of the quality of the films obtained, is reflected in the photophysical properties as well.</p>
