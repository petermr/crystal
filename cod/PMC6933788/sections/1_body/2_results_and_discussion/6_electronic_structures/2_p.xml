 </xref>b, we can note that valence band (VB) is mainly composed of Rb sp states, C sp states, H s states, O sp states, and N sp states. The conduction band (CB) mainly consists of Na sp states, C sp states O sp states, and N sp states. The top of the VB is composed of O p states and N sp states and the bottom of CB mainly consists of C sp states N sp states and O sp states, which manifests that the (H
