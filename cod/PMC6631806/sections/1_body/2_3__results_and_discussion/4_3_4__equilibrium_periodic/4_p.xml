<p>As the present work employs the SCFT, our results are subject to the known limitation of the mean-field theory. Nonetheless, SCFT theories including ours have been the most successful with their predictability of phase behaviors of inhomogeneous polymeric mixtures among various theories. It has been known that the Ginzburg–Landau region [
