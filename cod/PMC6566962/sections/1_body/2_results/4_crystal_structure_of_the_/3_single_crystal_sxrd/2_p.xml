<p>Structure refinement by single-crystal SXRD was made for the Al-31.0 at.%Fe alloy quenched from 300°C, and the details are given in 
 <xref rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>. Many sharp reflections closely spaced in the range of reciprocal space (~0.12 nm
 <sup>−1</sup>) are observed, being consistent with a long periodicity of the η″ phase. But neither reflection broadening nor streaking was observed even when the image-plate was overexposed. Among the eight possible space groups suggested by the 
 <italic>SHELXT</italic> software [
 <xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>], the only centrosymmetric space group 
 <italic>Pmcn</italic> (the 5th setting of 
 <italic>Pnma</italic>) of the highest symmetry is assigned to the η″ phase. The 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice constant of the η″ phase is 8.01655 nm. This value is exactly 19 times that of the parent η phase (0.42184 nm) [
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>], and this is in good agreement with the spacing of lattice fringes (~8 nm) observed in 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure. 2(g</xref>,
 <xref rid="F0002">h</xref>) as well as the long periodicity estimated with the splitting distance of superlattice diffraction spots (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(l</xref>)). In further structure refinement, we employed the following procedures. At first, the Fe1−Fe19 and Al1−Al19 sites constituting the FeAl
 <sub>2</sub> framework structure were assumed to be occupied exclusively by Fe and Al atoms, respectively, with full occupancy and isotropic displacement parameters. Meanwhile, the 14 different sites (Al21−Al25 and Al31−Al39) comprising the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain were assumed to be occupied exclusively by Al atoms. Then, mixed occupancies of Al and Fe atoms were allowed in each of the 14 different 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites for the occupancy determination. Only one of the 14 chain sites was refined in each fitting procedure to avoid divergence of the fitting, and the site to be refined was changed one by one until the occupancies for all the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites were converged. As a result, we found that the Al31−Al39 sites are occupied almost exclusively by Al atoms (96 ± 7% on average) while the average Fe occupancy at the Al21−Al25 sites is as high as 27 ± 12% (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites in the η″ phase are occupied by not only Al but also Fe atoms. This agrees with the result of crystal structure refinement for the η″ phase by Becker et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>], but is quite different from that of the η′ phase (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>8</sub>) reported in Ref [
 <xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>] where the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites are exclusively occupied by Al atoms in an ordered manner. Finally, anisotropic displacement parameters for all the 52 sites were refined. Supplementary Table S1 gives the atomic coordinates and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters refined for the η″ phase in the present study.
