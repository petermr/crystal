<p id="Par22">The structural relaxations of the primitive cells (80 atoms) with the associated changes in lattice constants and atomic coordinates were performed until the interatomic force on each atom was reduced below 0.005 eV/Å. The cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled using Γ-centered 4 × 4 × 4 meshes. Brillouin zone integrations were performed using Gaussian smearing with a smearing width of 0.1 eV. Electron spin polarizations were turned on.</p>
