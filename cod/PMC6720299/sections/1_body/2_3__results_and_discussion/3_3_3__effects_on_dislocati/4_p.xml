<p>In addition, it can be seen that the initial dislocation density was independent of temperature and stress level and was solely related to the grain size. Noticeably, the smaller the nanocrystalline NiAl grain size, the greater the initial dislocation density. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f002">Figure 2</xref>, under the same temperature and stress conditions, the primary creep and steady-state creep stages of nanocrystalline NiAl models were shortened with decreasing grain size. Moreover, the model entering tertiary creep is considered to be advanced. Taken together, these findings suggest that the reduced grain size may contribute to the occurrence of creep during the early stage of the creep process.
