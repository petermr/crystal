 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b shows the SEM image of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite. The spherical Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite with a diameter of 53 nm can be observed. EDX and mapping images further confirm the presence of Bi in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>j, c–f). The ratio of Cs, Sn, Bi, and Cl is 1:0.62:0.14:3, which is in good accordance with other reports [

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g shows the TEM image of Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs. As can be seen, the Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs show a cubic morphology with an average size of ∼ 12 nm. As can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>k, the ratio of Cs, Pb, Mn, and Cl is 1:0.77:0.19:2.68. The HRTEM image displays the lattice fringes of the Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs, which shows an interplanar distance of 3.67 Å, and matches well with that of the (101) plane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). The SAED pattern is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c. We can see that the QDs possess a tetragonal crystal structure with corresponding (101) and (200) planes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>i) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. XRD pattern of the Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs shows that the diffraction peaks are corresponding to the tetragonal phase, which is consistent with the SAED results.
