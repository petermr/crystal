 <caption> Three-dimensional morphology of the mesophase evolved from the generic test reflection given in Equation (12) in a simulation box (unit cell) of 5 × 5 × 5 R G 3 . Its image is depicted by using Mesodyn ( a) and also by Matlab ( b) just for comparison purposes. A domain as the dispersed phase is only drawn here. </caption>
