<p id="p0145">The initial sample 
 <bold>NCN0.55,</bold> right after its manufacture, consisted of two PLS with different thickness of the perovskite layer: Na
 <sub>2</sub>Ca
 <sub>4</sub>Nb
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>20</sub> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) and Na
 <sub>4</sub>Ca
 <sub>4</sub>Nb
 <sub>8</sub>O
 <sub>26</sub> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Both compounds had the pseudoorthorhombic symmetry, the cell parameters Na
 <sub>2</sub>Ca
 <sub>4</sub>Nb
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>20</sub>: 
 <italic>a</italic> = 5.503 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 37.79 Å, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.868 Å, Na
 <sub>4</sub>Ca
 <sub>4</sub>Nb
 <sub>8</sub>O
 <sub>26</sub>: 
 <italic>a</italic> = 5.502 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 49.52 Å, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.896 Å. In 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> it can be seen that, after long-term storage, the phase composition of NCN0.55 did not change, but the amount of the compound with greater 
 <italic>n</italic> increased (on the XRD pattern (2), the intensity of its peaks 0k0 increased). The redistribution of the phases towards an increase in the concentration of the compound with a higher 
 <italic>n</italic> indicates the adsorption of water by the sample, its dissociation into the oxygen and the hydrogen and the incorporation of the oxygen into the crystal lattice of the layered compound with the formation of the additional layer of octahedra. In NCN0.55 this process occurs less intensively than in NCN0.25, because, as shown above with the latter example, the adsorption and structuring of the oxygen occurs more actively in the interlayer space containing Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions. The compounds that make up NCN0.55 in approximately equal amounts contain – one 2Na and 4Ca, the other – 4Na and 4Ca, while, in the original NCN0.25, the Na/Ca ratio is 6/4.
