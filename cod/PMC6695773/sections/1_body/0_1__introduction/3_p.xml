<p>In this paper, by the means of thermal expansion measurement and in-situ X-ray diffraction during cooling/heating, thermal-induced reversible transformation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn was observed directly, and the crystal structure of the new phase was determined based on a set of electron diffraction patterns in TEM and XRD profiles. The results could provide fundamental insights into the properties of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn in the application as the anode material of lithium-ion battery, since volume change and phase transformation during lithiation and delithiation process at different temperatures should be carefully considered, which may lead to the low storage capacity, poor cycling and even the cracking and crumbing of the metal electrode [

 <sub>3</sub>Sn and improve the development of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn as a new generation of high damping metallic materials.
