<p id="Par17">Absorption and PL spectra were measured by Evolution 201 UV-Visible Spectrophotometer and iHR320 Photoluminescence Spectroscopy, respectively. SEM image was measured by FEI Helios 600 system. XPS was measured by Kratos Axis Ultra DLD X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer. The surface compositions of samples were analyzed by the Processing software on the system. The current (

 <italic>V</italic>)–luminance characterizations of the devices were performed in N
 <sub>2</sub> glovebox without encapsulation. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used to measure the 
 <italic>J</italic>–
 <italic>V</italic> data from 0 V to 7 V with a voltage scanning speed around 0.2 V s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The luminance of the device was recorded simultaneously by Konica Minolta, LS-160, or a calibrated silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu, S2387 1010 R) with an area of 10 mm × 10 mm. The photodiode was placed on top of the LED in close contact to collect light. The EQE was calculated using Lambertian profile and the obtained electroluminescence spectrum.
