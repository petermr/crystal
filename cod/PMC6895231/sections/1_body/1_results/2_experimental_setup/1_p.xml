<p id="Par16">Based on theoretical investigation of quantitative orientation mapping by Raman microscopy, we have developed and demonstrated a method, Single-Acquisition Raman Orientation Mapping (SAROM), for the study of crystalline samples. Our self-made Raman setup provides two orders of magnitude faster Raman polarization measurements compared with existing techniques and the ambiguity issue is overcome. The SAROM system is capable of simultaneously illuminating the sample with multiple laser beams at different orientations of the laser polarization state and detecting Raman scattering beams at multiple on-axis/off-axis scattering directions without using any moving parts (Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, chosen configuration with nine channels provides theoretically estimated accuracy of the orientation measurements by SAROM of &lt;1°.
