<p>Another approach of substitution of Pb atoms in perovskite materials is a formation of alloyed perovskites with mixture of metal atoms at B site in crystal lattice. In the work [

 <sub>3</sub>) perovskite was shown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f002">Figure 2</xref>f–h). The perovskite powder with this chemical composition was synthesized by a solid-phase reaction in evacuated Pyrex tubes between mixed CsI:SnI
 <sub>2</sub>:GeI
 <sub>2</sub> solid powder precursors (molar ratio 2:1:1). It was also shown that due to the formation of a stable oxide layer, which fully encapsulated and passivated the perovskite surface, these powders and films exhibited very high stability. The surface-oxide passivation approach reported here represented an alternate way for increasing the stability and efficiency of lead-free perovskites. In the work [
