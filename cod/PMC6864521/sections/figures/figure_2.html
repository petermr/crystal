 <caption> a) Schematics of a CdSe/CdS dot‐in‐rod nanostructure, along with the interfacial band alignment of the CdSe and CdS constituent materials. The core diameter (4.34 nm) and the CB offset (0.09 eV, inset) correspond to the values adopted for the calculation of the electronic wave functions and lasing wavelengths. The values of the VB offset (0.87 eV) along with those of the bandgaps for CdSe (1.68 eV) and CdS (2.46 eV) are also shown. The blue shadowed area indicates the range of potential values for the CB offset. Calculated wave functions for the electrons and holes for the laser emission in b) the single‐exciton regime at 628.6 nm, exhibiting mixed carrier dimensionality and small overlap, indicating that for the first exciton the hole/electron wave functions are localized in/near the core.
