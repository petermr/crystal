<p>The obtained ground-state σ of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> is a 14-atom unit cell and naturally built of B
 <sub>10</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup>
 <sub>2</sub> icosahedra and Si dumbbells. Interestingly, the two Si
 <sup>p</sup> atoms are arranged on the same polar triangle, thus forming skeleton (intraicosahedral) Si
 <sup>p</sup>–Si
 <sup>p</sup> bonds as depicted in

 <sup>p</sup> atoms for Si
 <sup>p</sup> results in a significant distortion of B
 <sub>10</sub>Si

 <sub>2</sub> clusters, and the lattice parameters of the most stable α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> are found to deviate from the ideal rhombohedral metric. The space group symmetry of the α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> ground-state σ is monoclinic 
 <italic>Cm</italic>. For α-SiB

 <italic>T</italic> = 0 K (shown in 
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>
 </xref>b) is based on a 28-atom primitive supercell. The structure is composed of B
 <sub>11</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup> and B
 <sub>10</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup>
 <sub>2</sub> icosahedra, which are arranged as alternating close-packed layers parallel to the
