<p id="Par20">The morphology and structure of the resulting products were characterized through field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Sirion-200) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X’Pert) with Cu Kα radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.15405 nm). The thermogravimetric analysis (TG) curves were measured by SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20, which were obtained from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate 10 ml/min). The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature using Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 Time Resolved and Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometers equipped with a 450-W Xe lamp. The oxidation state of europium element was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250). Electroluminescence (EL) spectrum was investigated by Ocean Optics FLAME-S-VIS-NIR spectrometer with a fiber integrating sphere (FOIS-1) and a Keithley 2400 electrometer.
