 </sup>. The DACs were heated using Watlow 240 V (rated at 4.65 W cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) coiled heaters wrapped around the outside of the DACs. The temperature was measured using a K-type thermocouple attached to one of the diamond anvils, close to the gasket. The accuracy of the thermocouple on the temperature range covered by the experiments is 0.4%
