 <caption> TEM images of (a) parent Cu 2– x S bifrustum NCs, (b) product Cu 1.03In 0.81S 2 (CIS) bifrustum NCs, after reaction with InCl 3–TOP at 100 °C, and (c) Cu 1.99Ga 0.04S nanocrystals, after reaction with GaCl 3–TOP at 100 °C. Top-right insets display the corresponding ED pattern. Bottom panels show azimuthally integrated ED (PED) patterns of (d) parent low-chalcocite Cu 2– x S nanocrystals, (e) product wurtzite CIS nanocrystals, and (f) product low-chalcocite Cu 1.99Ga 0.04S nanocrystals. Reference bars in (d,f) are calculated patterns based on the low-chalcocite Cu 2– x S crystal structure described in ref ( 34). Reference bars in (e) were obtained from JCPDS PDF-card 01-077-9459 for wurtzite CIS. </caption>
