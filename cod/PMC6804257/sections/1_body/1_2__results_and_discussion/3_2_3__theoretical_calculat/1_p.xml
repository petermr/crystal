<p>The DFT method was used to predict the ground state structures of metal complex molecules [ML14·H
 <sub>2</sub>O] (M = Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) at the LANL2MB/6-31G (d, p) level. The X-ray structure of [NiL14·H
 <sub>2</sub>O] was employed as the starting point in the calculation. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03556-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> contains selected geometric parameters for the optimized structures presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f004">Figure 4</xref>. It emerged that the calculated bond lengths and angles were in a very good agreement with those of the X-ray crystal structure of [NiL14·H
 <sub>2</sub>O], which is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figure S1</xref> for comparison [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Frequency calculations on the equilibrium geometries showed no imaginary frequencies for all the structures with the only exception of the MnL14 complex, for which complete suppression of an imaginary frequency due to the presence of hydrogen vibrations was not possible.
