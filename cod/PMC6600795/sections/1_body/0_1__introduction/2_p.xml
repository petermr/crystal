<p>In order to validate the theoretical foundation of the concept of dislocations, it is necessary to have experimental verification of the existence of dislocations in crystalline arrays. This experimental evidence of dislocations in crystalline structures came in the 1960s thanks to the advancement in imaging technology. Images of edge dislocations in a crystalline structure were obtained through X-ray photogrammetry, using X-rays recordings and an optical reconstruction. In the 1970s, transmission electron microscopy provided a powerful tool to observe the structure and the deformations of crystalline matter. TEM techniques have been progressively improved over the years. Just to limit the survey to the last 15 years, References [
