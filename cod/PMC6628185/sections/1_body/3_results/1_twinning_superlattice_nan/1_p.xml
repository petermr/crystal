<p>We grow GaP nanowires by metal–organic vapor phase epitaxy using the vapor–liquid–solid growth technique. We analyze the structural properties of the wires by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which shows that the wires have ZB structure, uniform diameter, and are grown along the ⟨111⟩ direction. Along the nanowire growth direction, regularly spaced twin planes can be observed. Bright-field (BF) TEM images show the ZB segments between consecutive twin planes with different contrast (

 </xref>a). A twin acts as a mirror plane, where the stacking of lattice planes ABCABC typical of a pure ZB structure are changed into ABC
 <underline>A</underline>CBA (

 </xref>h). By analyzing the variation of the contrast along the NW length, we obtain an estimation of the period. As displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>b, in our sample the period changes along the nanowire length: at the bottom of the NW, a first segment (∼500 nm) exhibits a constant period of about 10 nm; it is followed by a transition region (500–600 nm) with increasing period from 10 to 30 nm; at the end of the NW, a final segment (∼600 nm) has a constant period of about 30–40 nm. All the investigated TSL NWs exhibit very similar structural characteristics. The variation of the twin spacing along the NW length is shown by TEM and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) images taken at the different location along the NW (
