 <caption> Structure and characterization of the perovskite‐based PD. a) Structure of the device. Inset shows the 3D schematic of the crystal structure of MAPbI 3. SEM images of b) surface and c) cross‐sectional view of the MAPbI 3‐based film. d) Absorption spectra of the MAPbI 3‐based composite film (Curve I) and the mesoporous TiO 2 film (Curve II). e) Absorption spectrum of MAPbI 3‐based composite film and its overlapping wavelength with the wind‐driven TIEL emission. f) Current distribution mapping of the PD with bias voltages from −4 to +8 V and increments of 4 V in a dark environment or upon illumination (power density of 50 mW cm −2). g) Corresponding I–V characteristics of the PD. </caption>
