 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>

 </sup> Once the intensity for each phonon mode has been calculated, Raman spectra are generated by summing up Lorentzian functions, each associated to a calculated mode frequency. The Lorentzian functions have a full width at half-maximum that is chosen to reproduce the experimental one.
