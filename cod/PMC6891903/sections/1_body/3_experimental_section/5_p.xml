 <italic>Measurements</italic>: The crystal structure was characterized by XRD (x pert 3). All SEM and EDS images were recorded with the SU8020 camera. The absorption properties were analyzed by the UV–vis–NIR light source (Shimazu UV‐3600). Optical emission was recorded by a spectrometer and optical fibers arranged perpendicularly with collimating lenses (NOVA). All the electrical measurements were performed with the Keithley 2400 system electrometer. The surface morphology investigation, the SKPM, and CAFM measurements were carried out with the MFP‐3D AFM in an ambient environment (Park Systems NX‐10). The Ir‐based probe with Pt coating was obtained from Nanoworld (product no. EFM‐10).
