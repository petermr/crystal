 <caption> One-dimensional mean squared displacement (MSD) and four example trajectories along two different crystal direction for the PHCs at the (a) ZnO(101[combining macron]0), and (b) ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surfaces. The dashed lines in the trajectory plots are separated by distances equal to the surface unit cell along the corresponding crystal direction. </caption>
