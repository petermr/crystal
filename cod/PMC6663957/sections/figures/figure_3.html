 <caption> Images of the Derenzo phantom simulated inside the Scanner A reconstructed using OSEM algorithm with 5 subsets and 24 subiterations. a Cylindrical geometry, b block geometry, and c difference image as cylindrical subtracted from block. At the bottom-right, the line profiles through the sources of 1.2 mm and 2.4 mm diameter are plotted as well as the difference between the two line profiles. The color bar in the first row is common to both images </caption>
