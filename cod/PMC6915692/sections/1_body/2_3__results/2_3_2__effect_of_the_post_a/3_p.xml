<p>The diffuse reflectance spectra and the associated chromatic coordinates in L*, a*, b* space of the powders annealing at different temperatures under air are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f010">Figure 10</xref>. There is no optical difference between the raw product and the product annealed at 100 °C—the two spectra are almost superimposed, and the colorimetric coordinates are similar. In regard to these two references and the first samples, the spectra of the powder obtained at 200 °C and 300 °C show: (i) a new absorbing contribution in the visible range, around 600 nm, which may be associated with the presence of carbon radicals that were revealed by EPR measurement, (ii) a large increase of the reflectance intensity (decrease of the large absorption band) in the NIR part of the spectrum corresponding to a decrease of the W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions concentration due to the oxidative conditions of the post-annealing treatment, as observed by EPR. Carbon traces, despite the washing steps of the raw sample, remain in the raw powder. The very viscous di-ethylene-glycol used as solvent, with a furthermore high ebullition point (245 °C), is in fact very difficult to fully eliminate. Additionally, the positive capillary effect produced by the intra-agglomerate porosity, which can promote the agglomeration of the WO
 <sub>3</sub> NPs particles and was observed by TEM, contributes to limit the removal of the polyol traces in the raw samples. Hence, during the heat treatment, organic compounds, most likely from the polyol solvent, have been partially degraded and radical carbons residues can be detected in the material. This signal is not detected for the powders annealed at 100 °C because the temperature is not high enough to initiate the degradation of the polyol (di-ethylene glycol has a boiling point of 245 °C at room pressure under air). The product annealed at 400 °C shows a diffuse reflection signal very similar to the 600 °C annealed powder, with, nonetheless, a less important reflectance in the NIR range. Interestingly, this shows that a higher W
 <sup>5+</sup> concentration is maintained after a post-annealing treatment at 400 °C than compared to 600 °C. Furthermore, this observation can be related to the lower crystallinity of the annealed powder at 400 °C in comparison with the 600 °C annealed sample. This study thus shows that it is possible to modulate the absorption intensity in infrared by varying the crystallinity of the product through the control of the heat treatment temperature.
