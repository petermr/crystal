<p id="Par44">In conclusion, we have combined high-quality blue-emitting bismuth-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite with orange-emitting Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs to fabricate WLED. Because they all contain the same anion of Cl, anion exchange reaction can be avoided. Besides, orange-emitting Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs show better stability compared with iodine-containing counterparts. The WLED with color coordinates of (0.334, 0.297) is acquired by tuning the ratio of them. In addition, the WLED show excellent long-term operating stability, which is by far, to our knowledge, the most stable one among perovskite-based WLEDs. We believe our findings will open up new avenues for the exploration of novel lead-free perovskite-based WLED.
