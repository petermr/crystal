<p id="Par11">To ensure that the crystal used for the structure determination is representative for the whole sample, a powder diffraction pattern of a bulk sample was recorded. A Rietveld refinement of the PXRD data revealed that 93 wt% of the bulk material was indeed the afore described phase Sr[Li
 <sub>2</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>], with impurities of SrO (7 wt%) and AlN (not quantifiable). For further details see Supplementary Note
