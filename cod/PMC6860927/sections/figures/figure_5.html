 <caption> A flowchart of the BooT-PCA on an aluminum bi-crystal dataset: Firstly, image processing is performed on a series of detector hit maps, secondly tracking and line detection are performed. Next the collected data is reconstructed into 3D Cartesian coordinates, thirdly, a slope filter, PCA and triangulation (consists of mesh vertices) are applied sequentially to filter out zone lines atoms and fully reconstruct the GB surface. </caption>
