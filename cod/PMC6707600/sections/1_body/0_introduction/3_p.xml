<p>The present study aimed to further characterize femur morphogenesis by examining successive stages from cartilage condensation to endochondral ossification. Therefore, the morphogenesis of the femur in the chondrogenic stage and the subsequent endochondral ossification were analyzed in 3-D using phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography (PCX-CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. In addition, the internal differentiation process, including ossification and cavity formation at the diaphysis and cartilage canal formation at the epiphysis, was analyzed. Procrustes analysis was performed to distinguish the change in shape from the change in size according to growth.</p>
