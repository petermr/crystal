<p id="Par17">On the other hand, the CVGs of 1B-GR and 1B-BYR exhibit a lesser shift of the 16 hue bins. The red circles (our LED) almost overlap with the black one (reference illuminant). The local Chroma shifts for the 1B-GR and 1B-BYR were under 7% and 5%, respectively. The D
 <sub>uv</sub> – a measure of the CCT value shift from the black body locus is −0.0007 for 1B-Y LED PKG. The D
 <sub>uv</sub> of the 1B-GR is −0.0006 and 0 for 1B-BYR. Note that the CCT value of the 1B-BYR LED PKG is 3006, which lies almost on the black body locus, and therefore there is no shift from the black body locus.
