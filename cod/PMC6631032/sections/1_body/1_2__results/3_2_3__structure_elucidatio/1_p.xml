 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) presented three singlet proton signals at the lower field of the spectrum (9.83, 8.97, 8.50 ppm), two doublet signals, 2H each, in the aromatic region of the spectrum (6.87, 7.93 ppm) and a singlet methyl signal resonating at 2.48 ppm. The

 <bold>3</bold> (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) presented eight aromatic signals, two of which doubled and a single methyl signal at the aliphatic region. The two aromatic doublet proton signals, 7.93 and 6.87 ppm (2H each), presented mutual COSY correlations suggesting a conjugated phenol ring. The remaining three singlet signals presented very weak COSY correlations of the signal at 8.50 ppm with those at 8.97 and 2.48 ppm, suggesting that they belong to the same aromatic spin system but are coupled through four or more bonds. The chemical shifts of the protons and carbons (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), as well as the C–H coupling constants (obtained from the HSQC experiment), suggested that they belong to an heteroaromatic spin system. The heteroaromatic methine-2 presented HMBC correlation with the aromatic methyl-11. The latter methyl presented an additional HMBC correlation with an heteroaromatic quaternary imine carbon-3, suggesting a direct connection between them. The HMBC correlations of H-2 with C-3, C-5 and C-11, and of H-5 with C-3 and C-6, established the 1,4-pyrazine ring system. Finally, the HMBC correlation of H-8 and H-8’ with C-6 proved the connection of the phenol ring to the pyrazine ring through C-6, establishing structure of veronipyrazine for
