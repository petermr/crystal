<p id="Par13">The coexistence of three modes between 0.68 and 0.80 r.l.u. strongly indicates the presence of two triplon bands, which is not allowed if the interdimer interactions along both 
 <italic>a</italic>-axes and 
 <italic>b</italic>-axes are uniform. Starting from the uniform case, we will introduce the bond alternation to explain this phenomenon. Note that the triplon bands are degenerate since the crystallographic unit cell includes eight dimers, which are connected by a mirror symmetry with respect to the 
 <italic>bc</italic>-plane, centering symmetry, and twofold screw symmetry along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. For a simplicity, we will not take into account the fourfold degeneracy caused by the latter two symmetries and instead focus on two dimers in a primitive unit cell with a single layer, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. In the uniformly interacting case, only one continuous triplon band is detectable, whereas the structure factor of the other is almost zero. The dispersion branches with strong and weak scattering intensities along the (
 <italic>H</italic>, 0) and (0, 
 <italic>K</italic>) directions are depicted as solid and dashed curves in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, respectively. The high-energy band is not observable, because of a very small structure factor resulting from the two almost parallel dimers. In other words, the dimer orientations are so close to each other that triplet excitations cannot be distinguished from those expected from a hypothetical unit cell containing only one dimer. The presence of a triplon band with very weak intensities was also reported in TlCuCl
