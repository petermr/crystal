<p>In the case of the classical AB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f008">Figure 8</xref>a), we can observe that a generalized decrease of 
 <italic>IL</italic> is produced at the frequency range considered after the airflow, when an improvement of the sand accumulation on the front side of the AB is produced, except in the 350 to 500 Hz range where a slight improvement of the 
 <italic>IL</italic> before the airflow appears.
