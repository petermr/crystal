<p>The lattice constants are determined by minimizing the total energy for each state, and their values are listed in 
 <xref rid="RSOS191007TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. The results from our calculations are in good agreement with other experimental measurements and theoretical calculations [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In order to further check the structure stability, we computed the total energy difference between the XA structure and the L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure at ferromagnetic state under different lattice constants, and the results are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F2">figure 2</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>,
 <italic>d</italic>. For Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi, this energy difference is positive at small lattice constant, indicating the stability of L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure, and continuously decreases to negative value, leading to XA structure stabilization at large lattice constant. A reverse changing trend is observed for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi with stable XA structure at small lattice constant and stable L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure at large lattice constant. This sign changing effect of the total energy difference with lattice variation could induce the stable structure transformation under different lattice values. We also calculated the total energy difference of XA and L2
 <sub>1</sub> structures at ferromagnetic state under their own corresponding equilibrium lattice constants, and it is − 0.16 eV for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and − 0.14 eV for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi.
