 <sup>2+</sup> in the K2 site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Similarly, the larger CFS of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in K

 </sup>. Therefore, the blueshift occurred when heated. At low temperature of 80 K, the thermal ionization of 5
 <italic>d</italic> electrons becomes weak, and the dominant emission peak centers at longer wavelength (790 nm) associated with the more contribution from Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions occupying Lu sites. In contrast, thermal quenching behavior at high temperatures has a much weaker effect on the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in K2 sites than on the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in Lu sites, resulting in a relatively stronger emission at short wavelength. Therefore, with temperature increasing, the blueshift and the broadening of emission spectra occur simultaneously.
