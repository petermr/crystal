 <p id="Par2">Atomistic structure prediction of the metal-ligand interface of hybrid nanoparticles remains challenging. Here the authors present an algorithm to predict the structure of the metal-ligand interface of ligand-stabilized gold and silver nanoparticles, guided by experimental data on local chemical environments.</p>
