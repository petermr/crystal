<p id="Par21">The analysis chamber houses an electron analyser (Specs Phoibos 100 2D-CCD) and x-ray source (Specs XR 50) for XPS measurements. The chamber is directly attached to the preparation chamber thus allowing for 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> growth and analysis. A full description of the setup is available at ref.

 </sup>. In this work the samples have been excited by non-monochromatic Al K
 <italic>α</italic> radiation. The survey spectra were obtained with a constant pass energy of 20 eV, and detailed region spectra with 10 eV. The uncertainty that arises from the corresponding spectra are 0.37 eV and 0.19 eV respectively.
