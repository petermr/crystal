 <caption> (a) Decay curves of 4T 2(4F) → 4A 2 of Na 3AlF 6:60% Cr 3+ phosphors against temperature. (b) Thermal characteristics of 4T 2(4F) → 4A 2 of Na 3AlF 6:60% Cr 3+: emission intensity marked by red stars and the corresponding lifetime by blue spheres. (c) Single configurational coordinate model for Cr 3+ far-red emission under effect of temperature increment in Na 3AlF 6 low-field crystal. R denotes the configurational coordinate, the green arrow indicates the thermal activation process, and the pink curved arrow represents the NR process. (d) Optical images of Na 3AlF 6:60% Cr 3+ phosphors shined by natural white light (left top) and UV light (left bottom) and that of a bare blue-emitting InGaN LED device (right top) and the InGaN LED device encapsulated with a silicone Na 3AlF 6: 60% Cr 3+ phosphor slurry (right bottom). </caption>
