<p>The scanning probe microscopy measurements were implemented on a commercial AIST-NT SmartSPM 1000 atomic force microscope at room temperature in an inert atmosphere (i.e., controlled N
 <sub>2</sub> environment). The PFM measurements were performed at an AC imaging bias of 1 V (peak to peak) and a frequency of approximately 700 kHz. The spectroscopic piezoresponse hysteresis loops were acquired at fixed spatial locations by supplying a triangular DC waveform with a superimposed low-amplitude AC modulation.
