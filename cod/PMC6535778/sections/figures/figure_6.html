 <caption> Calculated electronic structure of bulk EuSn 2P 2. (A–D) First-principles electronic band structures for EuSn 2P 2 in its A-type antiferromagnetic ordered state (both spin up and spin down bands are shown) with and without spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and correlation parameter U included. (E) Deconvolution of the electronic structure to show the energy regimes of dominance of the Eu, P, and Sn orbitals. </caption>
