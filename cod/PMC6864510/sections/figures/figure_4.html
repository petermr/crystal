 <caption> a) Structural illustration of a single‐layer (BA) 2PbBr 4 (blue balls for lead atoms, large orange balls for bromine atoms, red balls for nitrogen atoms, and small orange balls for carbon atoms; H atoms were omitted for clarity). b) Optical image of the 2D square sheets. Scale bar is 10 mm. c,d) AFM images and height profiles of several single/double layers with thickness of 1.6/3.4 nm (±0.2 nm).
