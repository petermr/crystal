<p>In order to characterize the oxygen vacancy distribution, a neutron powder diffraction (NPD) study was carried out. A high-resolution pattern was collected in the D2B diffractometer at the Laue-Langevin Institute (Grenoble, France) with a neutron wavelength λ = 1.594 Å within the angular range of 2θ from 10 to 160°. About 2 g of the sample was contained in a cylindrical vanadium holder. A time of 2 h was required to collect a full diffraction pattern at 25 °C. The diffraction data were analyzed by the Rietveld method through the FULLPROF program (version 3.00) [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-01957" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A pseudo-Voigt function was chosen to generate the line shape of the diffraction peaks. The scale factor, background points, zero shift, half-width, pseudo-Voigt corrected for asymmetry parameters, unit-cell parameters, positional coordinates and isotropic displacement factors for metals and anisotropic for oxygen atoms were refined in the final run. Occupancy factors for oxygen atoms were also refined from the collected NPD data.
