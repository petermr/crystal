 <caption> Stability studies of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2. a PXRD patterns of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2 before and after 1000 cycles. Patterns were measured directly on the surface of the glassy carbon working electrode on which the catalyst ink was deposited. A small amount of silicon powder was placed on the surface to act as an internal standard. PXRD patterns obtained after electrocatalytic measurements were performed directly on the electrode surface; therefore a layer of H 2SO 4 electrolyte is present and may result in weaker Bragg reflections. b Wide-range Raman spectra of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2 measured before (top) and after 1000 cycles (bottom). Raman spectra obtained after electrochemical measurements were performed directly on the electrode surface, therefore a layer of H 2SO 4 electrolyte is present thus resulting in an increased background after 1000 cycles.
