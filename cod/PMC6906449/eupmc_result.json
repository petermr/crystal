    "AgInTe2 compound has not received enough recognition in thermoelectrics, possibly due to the fact that the presence of Te vacancy (VTe) and antisite defect of In at Ag site (InAg) degrades its electrical conductivity. In this work, we prepared the Ag1-xInTe2 compounds with substoichiometric amounts of Ag and observed an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κL = 0.1 Wm-1K-1) for the sample at x = 0.15 and 814 K. This leads to more than 2-fold enhancement in the ZT value (ZT = 0.62) compared to the pristine AgInTe2. In addition, we have traced the origin of the untralow κL using the Callaway model. The results attained in this work suggest that the engineering of the silver vacancy (VAg) concentration is still an effective way to manipulate the thermoelectric performance of AgInTe2, realized by the increased point defects and modified crystal structure distortion as the VAg concentration increases."
