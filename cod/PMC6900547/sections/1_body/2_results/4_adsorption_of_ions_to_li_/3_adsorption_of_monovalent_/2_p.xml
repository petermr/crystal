<p>Sodium and potassium show similar behavior when they are adsorbed onto zabuyelite surfaces (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>b,c). On the (001) and (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) surfaces, the cations align themselves between the rows of water molecules. The channels in which the adsorbates position themselves are parallel with the 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> crystal axis on the (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) and (001) surfaces, respectively. On the (110) surface, Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> adsorb at similar positions; however, instead of occupying channels between the water molecules at the surface, the ions are positioned above the water molecules and the water molecules rotate at the surface so that the H atoms lie parallel to the surface. This rotation allows the O atoms of the water molecules to interact with the adsorbing cations and Li ions within the (110) surface. Similarly, Cl
 <sup>–</sup> adsorbs to the (001) surface between the water molecule channels aligned parallel the 
 <italic>b</italic> axis of the crystal (

  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>d). The (110) surface also shows similar behavior for Cl
 <sup>–</sup> and the monovalent, monatomic cations, where the anion positions itself above the water molecules at the surface. However, because of the negative charge of the Cl
 <sup>–</sup> ions the water molecules closest to the anion interact via their H rather than O atom. The main difference between the adsorption of monovalent, monatomic cations and anions is found on the (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) surface. Here, the chlorine anions also positioned themselves above the water molecules. Complexation of the monovalent ions at the crystal surfaces changes the surface stability further than water adsorption to the surface. The equilibrium morphology of the crystal remains elongated, with {110} faces at the crystal edges, but for the adsorption of Cl
 <sup>–</sup> the (001) surface area becomes much more limited.
