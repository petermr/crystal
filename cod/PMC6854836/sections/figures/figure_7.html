 <caption> Various views of β-SiB 3 samples. (a) Image of a micron-Si/B = 1:2 pellet after sintering for 2 weeks at 1200 °C. The diameter of the pellet is 5 mm. The inset at the top left shows close-up, highlighting orange, faceted, β-SiB 3 crystals protruding from the pellet surface. The lower inset shows the remainder of the pellet after dissolution of excess Si with a mixture H 2O/HF/HNO 3. (b) β-SiB 3 sample obtained from high-pressure synthesis (8 GPa, 1100 °C) using a close to stoichiometric mixture of crystalline boron and micron-Si (after crushing and washing the sample with hot 20% NaOH solution). </caption>
