<p>In another infected red blood cell (iRBC labeled 
 <italic>A</italic> in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>), the concentration at which BrQ was introduced into the culture was 40 nM, in keeping with previous measurements reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Based on the same analytical procedure, the coverage onto hemozoin by BrQ was measured to be ∼10 ± 4%. This extent is nearly the same as that for iRBC 
 <italic>C</italic>, even though the drug was introduced at an almost 4 times lower concentration.
