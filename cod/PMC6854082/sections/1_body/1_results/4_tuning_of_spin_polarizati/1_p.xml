 </sup>. In the 2D SnTe case, the switching of the in-plane electric polarization by 90° or 180° by electric field can also result in a change of the spin texture. Here, we rather propose another electric field effect. Since the BSVSP effect is protected by symmetries (e.g., mirror plane), one can use an electric field to break these symmetries and induce a net spin polarization. For example, the SnTe vanishing spin polarizations are protected by the two reflections, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0 and 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0 planes. Applying an external electric field along the 
 <italic>y</italic> axis (normal to the 2D thin film), which can break the glide reflection 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0 plane and reduce the symmetry of 2D SnTe thin film to the pseudo-polar 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>s</sub> symmetry, results in the emergence of the 
 <italic>x</italic> component of spin polarizations. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, the dependence of the 
 <italic>x</italic> components on 
 <italic>k</italic> by applying a 0.1 V/Å external electric field indeed confirms our analysis. By projecting spin polarizations on atoms, one can observe that the 
 <italic>x</italic> components of spin polarizations with different orientations do not cancel each other any more, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>. This behavior can be regarded as “ferrimagnetism of the Bloch state” and ensures the emergence of spin polarizations. The magnitude of spin polarization at a 
 <italic>k</italic> point is linearly proportional to the external electric field, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>. In particular, an opposite external electric field can lead to a flop of spin polarizations, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. This can be understood since these two states are related by the glide reflection—
 <italic>y</italic> = 0 plane. Our 
 <italic>k</italic>·
 <italic>p</italic> model analysis shows that this electric field effect arises from the fact that the electric field causes an energy splitting of the orbitals located at different positions along the out-of-plane direction (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In some sense, this effect can be considered as one type of linear magnetoelectric coupling
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, namely linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space. We recall that in the conventional linear magnetoelectric coupling, the electric field induces a change of magnetization in the whole system. On the contrary, in the linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space hereby proposed, the electric field induces a change of spin polarization for some particular Bloch eigenstates.
