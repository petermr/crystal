<p>One of the causes of perovskite degradation is attributed to the oxidation of I
 <sup>–</sup> to I
 <sub>2</sub> in aprotic solvent which introduces deficiency not only in I/Pb stoichiometry as reported for MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> but also for other iodide-based perovskites.

 </sup> For this process, moisture is essential, and the degradation is accelerated under various stresses, such as oxygen presence, light illumination, or applied bias. This degradation starts with uncontrolled incorporation of moisture during the fabrication, and for this reason, it is advisable to fabricate devices in low humidity environment. The use of a reducing agent to prevent I
 <sub>2</sub> formation was shown by Zhang et al. using hypophosphorous acid (HPA) as the additive.

 </sup> ZnI
 <sub>2</sub>, which is present in the precursor solution as Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and I
 <sup>–</sup>, is a stronger reducing agent compared to HPA and reacts with the I
 <sub>2</sub> formed in solution during fabrication reducing defects in the stoichiometry and leading to a more stable perovskite. The reduced defect density is also reflected in the enhanced PL shown later in this work.
