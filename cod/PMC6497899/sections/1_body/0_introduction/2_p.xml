<p id="Par29">In this work, we introduce Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs and Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> as the orange emission light and blue emission light to fabricate high-performance WLEDs. These two materials both can be excited by UV light and exhibit high QYs under UV light. They also contain the same anion Cl, which avoids the anion exchange reaction during the mixing process. Besides, it is worth to note that the emission linewidths of these two perovskites are very broad, which facilitate to form a continuous spectrum. In a WLED with a CCT of 5311K, the color coordinates of (0.334, 0.297) and CRI of 80 were achieved. Most of all, this WLED showed excellent stability against increasing currents and working time.
