<p>Subsequently, we further studied the wavelength-dependent photodetector fabricated using 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. In detail, a constant power value scale was set at 900 μW, and the incident wavelength of illumination laser was varied from 500 to 750 nm. Then we carried out the measurement along the two different TE/RE pairs of 30° and 150° with bias voltage at 5 mV, and the

 <sub>ds</sub> curves are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> and 6b. As observed from the two figures, the value scales of the basic current along 30° and 150° are around 4.0 nA and 1.2 μA, respectively, due of the anisotropic absorption of light. Although the basic current induced by daylight illumination turned out to be a non-negligible, the photocurrent changed immediately when the laser state was alternately switched between on and off. Both the response and recovery time are around 200 ms. Furthermore, a distinguishable wavelength-resolved phenomenon can be observed from the two figures. Thus, the 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> material can be used for wavelength-dependent photodetectors.
