<p>The fact that both the AE–LCAO and PP–PW approaches provide a very similar description at the PBE level suggests that the plane-wave and local Gaussian orbital basis sets used are both well converged and that the pseudopotentials are describing the valence-core interactions adequately. This also facilitates the comparison of the results of PP–PW-PBE+U calculations with AE–LCAO-HSE and -B3LYP calculations, as we can be confident that the numerical approximations used are equivalent. This allows us to assess the accuracy of the widely used DFT+U approach.</p>
