<p>The textured surfaces influence the contact areas, and further influence the friction behaviors. In this work, the friction properties of different textured surfaces are studied, including different depths (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.3615, 0.723, 1.0845 nm), different widths (
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.3615, 0.723, 1.0845 nm), different orientations (
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°), and different shapes (#-shape, rectangular, v-shape). Before sliding, the tip is pressed into substrate for 0.3615 nm. The sliding velocity is 5 m/s and sliding distance is 15 nm.
