 <caption> Electronic Partial Density Of State (PDOS) plots in the vicinity of the band gap theoretically calculated for crystalline 1 a . Shrinking of the band gap with pressure is clearly visible. The highest occupied energy band is dominated by contributions from the pyrene moiety (blue), while a small contribution from the C=O (red) and Câ‰¡C (green) fragments is visible in addition to that of pyrene at the lowest unoccupied energy levels. </caption>
