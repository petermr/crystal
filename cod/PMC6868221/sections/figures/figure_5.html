 <caption> Estimation of the Mg concentrations and compositional strain. The estimated Mg concentration and the compositional strain are shown for the four separate XRD peak reflections for the metastable Al after HPT for 100 turns and after natural aging in ( a,b), respectively. The vertical dashed lines are calculated with the lattice parameter of α 0 = 4.049 Å for pure Al in each plot. </caption>
