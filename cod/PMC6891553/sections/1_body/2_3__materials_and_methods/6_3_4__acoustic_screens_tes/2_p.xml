<p>The classical AB, which by definition is a continuous wall, consisted of an MDF panel of 37.5 cm × 52 cm × 1 cm and was placed in such a way that the transversal section of the scaled wind tunnel was completely covered. This kind of AB is usually designed to attenuate noise in a wide range of frequencies due to its geometric characteristics, as it completely covers the line of sight between the sound source and the receiver, avoiding the transmission of noise.</p>
