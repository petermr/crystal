<p id="Par26">Motor-doped liquid crystals were injected with a microinjector (Femtojet, Eppendorf), using commercially available needles (Femtotips, Eppendorf) in an aqueous (25 wt % D
 <sub>2</sub>O) surfactant solution (13 wt %, TTAB). The chamber containing the aqueous solution was prepared by applying an adhesive spacer (≈ 1 mm in thickness) onto a microscope slide. After injection, the chamber was closed with a glass coverslip. The size of the droplets was tuned by changing the injection pressure and injection time of the Femtojet.
