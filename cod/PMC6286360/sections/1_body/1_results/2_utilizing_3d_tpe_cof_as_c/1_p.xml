 </sup>. A common approach to fabricate WLEDs is coating a yellow-emitting phosphor on a blue LED chip, and the white light can be produced from the combined down-converted emissions of the phosphor and the blue component of the LED chip. As 3D-TPE-COF emits yellow fluorescence upon excitation with blue light, we then explore the possibility of using this 3D COF for WLEDs. By using a simple dip-coating procedure (see Supplementary Method 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> for details), a thin film of 3D-TPE-COF can be homogeneously coated onto the surface of a commercially available blue LED lamp (peaking around 450 nm). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, when the LED was turned on, bright white light was generated. The CIE coordinates were determined to be (0.30, 0.35), which are close to the standard coordinates for pure white light (0.33, 0.33). To explore the potential of practical application, we further tested the stability of this prototype WLED (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Obviously, the luminescence of the COF-coated WLED is considerably stable under continuously driving at ambient condition for 1200 h. Such highly stable WLED has seldom been reported for the one with a down-conversion layer of organic compounds. Therefore, by simply coating onto the commercial blue chips, 3D-TPE-COF has shown interesting application in robust, low-cost, and rare-earth metal-free WLEDs.
