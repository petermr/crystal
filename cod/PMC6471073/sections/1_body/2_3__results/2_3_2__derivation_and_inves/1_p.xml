<p>The resonant frequency and mode shape obtained by the mathematical modeling can be applied on the investigation of the DRG lumped mass-spring model, the frequency splitting theory, the DRG performance analysis, and so on. Here, they are used for the investigation of the DRG lumped mass-spring model. In the analysis of gyroscopes, the lumped mass-spring model is always used instead of the distributed mass-spring model [
