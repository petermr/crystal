<p>CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> was prepared by mixing Ca
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> and Ta
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub> using a 15% (w/w) excess of Ca
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>. For the synthesis of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Ta
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>, Mg
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> and Ta
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub> were mixed in 1:1 stoichiometric ratios while a 1.2:2 ratio was used for the preparation of MgTa
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub>. After grinding, the reactant powders were pressed into pellets at 10 ton and annealed for 20 h under flowing N
 <sub>2</sub> (Air Products, ALPHAGAZ, &gt;99.9999%) atmosphere. Temperatures of 1080, 850, and 1100 °C were employed for the synthesis of CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>, MgTa
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub>, and Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Ta
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively, with 300 °C/h heating rate. After the thermal treatment, the samples were naturally cooled in the furnace. All the thermal treatments were carried out in Mo (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) crucibles inside a silica tube, using Zr foil (Goodfellow, 99.2%) as sample holder caps and tube inlet traps in order to avoid water and oxygen contaminations.
