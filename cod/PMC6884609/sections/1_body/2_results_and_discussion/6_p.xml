<p id="Par21">As is discussed above, the shape transformation of the (001) nanoplate is driven by the shear stress, whose distribution relies heavily on the lattice arrangement. In order to further exemplify the possibility of tailoring the morphology through crystalline orientation design, we modeled a nanoplate of three-layer (110) atoms, in which each layer is split into four different oriented facets, as demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a (referred as “modulated (110) nanoplate” hereafter). Orange lines in the schematic illustration indicate their respective [110] directions. To facilitate a comparison, we showed the regular (110) nanoplate in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d. For the initial configuration, the calculated potential energy of the modulated (110) nanoplate equals − 3.617 eV/atom, higher than the corresponding value of the regular (110) nanoplate ( − 3.668 eV/atom) due to the existence of interfacial energy. In contrast to the uniform pattern of shear stress distribution of the regular (110) nanoplate (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), remarkable stress gaps appear between adjacent facets in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. These gaps are especially significant among the atoms located near the grain boundaries. After relaxation at 1 K, the region with stress gradient extends to involve more atoms around the boundaries, as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c. Meanwhile, the averaged potential energy drops to − 3.653 eV/atom, and the configuration bending results in a saddle plate, similar to the (001) nanoplate. As the temperature is continuously elevated, during the shape evolution of the modulated (110) nanoplate, three stages can be identified with 179 and 277 K as the critical points. In the first stage, the saddle shape basically maintains despite minor fluctuations, as exemplified in the inset snapshot of 100 K. However, after the transition occurring at 179 K, the configuration converts back to be disk-like and keeps this shape without obvious change throughout the second stage (see, for example, the inset snapshot of 200 K). Around the critical point (179 K), note that the raised part in the center combined with the fragmented surface plane still corresponds to the configuration with lower energy. Finally, when the temperature reaches 277 K, the system begins to shrink to irregular particle (cf. the inset snapshot of 300 K), leading to the radical reduction in the potential energy, similar to the fourth stage of the (001) nanoplate described earlier. Note that the potential energy of the regular (110) nanoplate begins to drastically decrease at 552 K (the corresponding data points are not entirely presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the modulated (001) nanoplate shows significantly decreased shape stability. These results indicate that the design of crystalline orientations is an efficient approach to modulate the shape stability.
