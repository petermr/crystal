<p>Qeq charges are computed with the same protocol we tested in our previous work:
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>
 </sup> the periodic-Qeq (PQeq) calculator egulp
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>
 </sup> was used with GMP parameters. Out of 310 neutral COFs, only one did not converge the Qeq calculation (17131N2).
