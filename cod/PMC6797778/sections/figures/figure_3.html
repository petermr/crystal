 <caption> Evolution of potential energy curve on the Q LS coordinate along the ferroelectric switching directions under ( a, b) x-polarized and ( c, d) y-polarized pulse. Rapidly oscillating Q IRx under pulse modulates the potential energy curve (grey lines) with respect to the static case at Q IR  = 0 Å \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sqrt{\mu }$$\end{document} μ (bold black line). The effective potential energy experienced by the Q LS is the time-average of the potential energy curves (orange line). 〈Φ〉 is the effective energy barrier under the pulse while Φ 0 is pristine energy barrier. Direction and relative magnitude of the effective anharmonic force F anh on Q LS are depicted by the orange arrow. ( e) Effective interlayer interaction between the Mo and S sublattices induced by Q IR . ( f) Contour plot of the interaction energy indicates the direction and relative magnitude of the anharmonic force depending on the polarization direction of Q IR . </caption>
