 </sup> provide a qualitative agreement of the nature of SRCs evolved. Here the local chemical composition of each element of the alloy across the width of the SRCs and the surrounding regions, as obtained from APT and MC/MD simulations are analysed and compared in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. For the APT based composition profile of the 4-days annealed sample, a cylindrical region was chosen which goes through the SRCs and whose axis is almost perpendicular to the SRC forming plane. Then the atoms falling inside the cylinder are binned at a distance of 1 Å and plotted in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,e</xref> are the local atomic concentration profiles of the MC/MD simulated system, taken along the three principal crystallographic directions. The simulated system with 25 MC swaps was chosen for comparison with the 4-days annealed alloy because of the close similarity of their nanostructure morphology (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The atomic composition scan from the APT reconstruction shows the strong prevalence of Zr at the SRCs and a weaker co-clustering effect with Hf. The 1-d composition profile of Zr perpendicular to the selected SRC in the APT analysis shows a Gaussian type composition variation. The width of the cluster from APT is around 1–1.5 nm as measured at the FWHM level of the concentration distribution

 </sup>. The concentration profiles of the elements from the MC/MD simulation was also found to be very similar to as found in the APT study with the SRCs being rich in Zr with just a lesser degree of co-clustering with Hf. The width of the SRC obtained from MC/MD simulation is close to 1–1.2 nm as observed for the APT and the peak composition of Zr is also similar for both MC/MD and APT. The Ta and Nb concentrations are depleted at the Zr-Hf rich SRCs evidenced from composition scan from both APT and MC/MD simulations. As the SRCs are depleted in Ta and Nb, their concentrations increased at the adjacent regions, as evident from both experimental and simulation results.
