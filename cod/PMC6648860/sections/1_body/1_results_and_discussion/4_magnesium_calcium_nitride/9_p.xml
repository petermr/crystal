<p>In order to probe the role of the Ca-vacancy ordering in deviations from the 
 <italic>R</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic> symmetry, we have considered a virtual composition Ca
 <sub>0.5</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> with 
 <italic>C</italic>2/
 <italic>m</italic> symmetry Ca and vacancies ordered in rows (see 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>A). Noteworthy, in the optimized structure of this material, both the TaN and CaN octahedra are distorted (see 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>
 </xref>), which is consistent with the monoclinic distortion observed experimentally in the pristine sample being driven by the Ca-vacancy ordering.

 </sup> Confrontation of the calculated data given in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>
 </xref> to the experimentally achieved values, (
 <italic>a</italic> = 5.4182(4), 
 <italic>b</italic> = 3.1416(2), 
 <italic>c</italic> = 5.9428(4) Å and β = 108.18(3)°) 
 <italic>d</italic>(Ta–N) = 2.18(3) Å, 
 <italic>d</italic>(Ca–N) = 2.47(2), are consistent with the Ca content (
 <italic>x</italic>) in the as-prepared Ca
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> being between 0.5 and 1 as experimentally observed.
