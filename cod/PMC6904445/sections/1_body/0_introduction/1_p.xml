<p id="Par2">Strain engineering has been an interesting way to control the physical properties of materials at the nanoscale level, such as thin films that can withstand tensile or shear stresses up to a significant fraction of their ideal strength

 </sup>. The structural distortions induced by strain may stabilize new crystallographic structures and thermodynamic phases, some of them not found in the bulk material, promoting new functionalities of materials

 </sup>. To attain significant effects of strain on the physical properties, in addition to a good connectivity between film and substrate, a strong coupling between lattice and other degrees of freedom, like electronic charge, spin and orbital, is required. In this regard, rare-earth manganites (
