      "In this data article, using density functional theory calculations, it is shown that in the gas phase, free from crystal packing effects, different elongation and compression Jahn-Teller geometries of fac and mer tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) are possible. A careful construction of input geometries made it possible to obtain the density functional theory calculated optimized geometries of different elongation and compression Jahn-Teller geometries of fac and mer tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III). The mer CF3-CF3 elongation isomer has the lowest energy (Fig. 1), while in the solid state a mer CH3-CH3 compression tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) isomer is experimentally characterized [1]. The rare experimental example of a compression tris(β-diketonato)-manganese(III) structure is ascribed to intermolecular F⋯F and F⋯H interactions between the tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) molecules in the solid crystalline state, contributing to the distortion of the coordination polyhedron of tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) from the expected elongation Jahn-Teller geometry, to the observed higher energy electronic state with compression Jahn-Teller distortion."

      "In this study, Tb3+-doped natural sodium feldspar (NaAlSi3O8) phosphors have been successfully prepared using high-temperature solid-state method with natural sodium feldspar as a substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis (EDX) of NaAlSi3O8 showed that 0.03 wt% of Eu element was present, and elemental distribution mapping analysis showed that the distribution of trace Eu in minerals was aggregated. The crystal structure and luminescence properties of the natural sodium Eu-containing feldspar and synthetic sodium feldspar NaAlSi3O8:Eu3+, Tb3+ phosphors are discussed in detail. The crystal structure analysis of the samples showed that the Na+ in the natural matrix was partly replaced by the doped Tb3+. Studies on the photoluminescence properties of the samples indicate that Eu does not form a luminescent center in the natural mineral, however, the strong characteristic peak of Eu3+ at 615 nm appears after doping with Tb3+ and the peak at 615 nm increases with the increase of Tb3+ concentration. According to the above spectral results, the energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ is obtained. Through the measurement and analysis of color coordinates, it is found that with the increase of Tb3+ concentration, the luminescence color of the samples can be regulated in the green to red region. NaAlSi3O8:Eu3+ Tb3+ phosphors has potential application value."

      "A high-throughput investigation of metallic glass formation via solid-state reaction was reported in this paper. Combinatorial multilayered thin-film chips covering the entire Ti-Ni-Cu ternary system were prepared using ion beam sputtering technique. Microbeam synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were conducted, with 1,325 data points collected from each chip, to map out the composition and the phase constitution before and after annealing at 373 K for 110 hours. The composition dependence of the crystal-to-glass transition by solid-state reaction was surveyed using this approach. The resulting composition-phase map is consistent with previously reported results. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) was performed on the representative compositions to determine the inter-diffusion between layers, the result shows that the diffusion of Ti is the key factor for the crystal-to-glass transition. In addition, both layer thickness and layer sequence play important roles as well. This work demonstrates that combinatorial chip technique is an efficient way for systematic and rapid study of crystal-to-glass transition for multi-component alloy systems."

      "Boosting is a family of supervised learning algorithm that convert a set of weak learners into a single strong one. It is popular in the field of object tracking, where its main purpose is to extract the position, motion, and trajectory from various features of interest within a sequence of video frames. A scientific application explored in this study is to combine the boosting tracker and the Hough transformation, followed by principal component analysis, to extract the location and trace of grain boundaries within atom probe data. Before the implementation of this method, these information could only be extracted manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on an experimental dataset obtained from a pure aluminum bi-crystal and validated on simulated data. The information gained from this method can be combined with crystallographic information directly contained within the data, to fully define the grain boundary character to its 5 degrees of freedom at near-atomic resolution in three dimensions. It also enables local atomic compositional and geometric information, i.e. curvature, to be extracted directly at the interface."

      "Elucidation of mesoscopic structures of molecular systems is of considerable scientific and technological interest for the development and optimization of advanced materials. Molecular dynamics simulations are a promising means of revealing macroscopic physical properties of materials from a microscopic viewpoint, but analysis of the resulting complex mesoscopic structures from microscopic information is a non-trivial and challenging task. In this study, a Machine Learning-aided Local Structure Analyzer (ML-LSA) is developed to classify the complex local mesoscopic structures of molecules that have not only simple atomistic group units but also rigid anisotropic functional groups such as mesogens. The proposed ML-LSA is applied to classifying the local structures of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) systems, which are of considerable scientific and technological interest because of their potential for sensors and soft actuators. A machine learning (ML) model is constructed from small, and thus computationally less costly, monodomain LCP trajectories. The ML model can distinguish nematic- and smectic-like monodomain structures with high accuracy. The ML-LSA is applied to large, complex quenched LCP structures, and the complex local structures are successfully classified as either nematic- or smectic-like. Furthermore, the results of the ML-LSA suggest the best order parameter for distinguishing the two mesogenic structures. Our ML model enables automatic and systematic analysis of the mesogenic structures without prior knowledge, and thus can overcome the difficulty of manually determining the specific order parameter required for the classification of complex structures."

      "2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) is a highly promising energetic material (EM) with high safety. Understanding its microscopic response mechanisms within the external stimulus is meaningful for the design of EMs. In order to comprehend the complicated phenomena, it is necessary to employ molecular simulation methods to investigate the response mechanisms with the force field (FF) at an atomic level. In this work, we developed a tailored FF for LLM-105 based on first-principles calculations. The validity of the FF was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. The structural parameters of LLM-105 predicted by FF are in good agreement with the experimental values, such as lattice constant, bond length, bond angle, dihedral angle and center of mass, and so forth. Moreover, the FF possesses good performance to describe the structural response on pressure accurately. In general, our work not only builds a balanced FF in gas and condensed phases, but also provides a useful tool to study the properties about LLM-105 at a large scale, which is helpful to improve the understanding about the balance between energy and safety in EMs."

      "A pressure-induced structural transition from the layered-like phase (Pnma) to another bilayer structure (Cmcm) in GeSe was investigated with first principle calculations. The variations of the structural, electronic, elastic, and vibrational properties of GeSe with the application of pressure were obtained. The transformation from the Pnma to Cmcm phase occurred at 34 GPa. The Cmcm phase structure showed dynamical stability above 37 GPa. The lattice parameters and the equation of state varied continuously at the transition pressure. Obvious stiffening in the C33 and C23 elastic constants associated with the compressive and shear components was observed to occur within the phase transition process. Two characteristic Raman modes (Ag and B3g) of the Pnma phase showed significant softening by increasing the pressure."

      "Recently, lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have gained tremendous attention in optoelectronic devices due to their excellent optical properties. However, the toxicity of lead limits their practical applications. Here, the synthesis of Zn2+-alloyed CsZnxPb1-xX3 (up to 15%) NCs is reported to achieve lead-reduced white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). The incorporation of Zn2+ into CsPbX3 host NCs results in a lattice contraction, without altering the structure and morphology, which has a direct effect on the optical properties. The blue-shifts in the photoluminescence emission and increase in bandgap is observed while retaining high photoluminescence quantum yield. Then by engineering the different compositions of halides for 15% Zn2+-alloyed CsZnxPb1-xX3 NCs, tunable emission (411-636 nm) is obtained. Notably, the WLEDs are experimentally demonstrated employing the lead-reduced NCs (blue, green, yellow, and red). By varying the ratios of the amount of NCs, white lights with a tunable correlated-color temperature (2218-8335 K), an exemplary color-rendering index (up to 93) and high luminous efficacy of radiation (268-318 lm·W-1) are obtained. Best of our knowledge, these are superior to other reported WLEDs based on CsPbX3 NCs doped with transition metal ions. This work places the halide perovskite NCs one-step closer in designing the environmentally benign and energy-efficient WLEDs."

      "In this article, a series of novel Mn4+-doped Ba2GdTaO6 (BGT) red-emitting phosphors were successfully synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state method. The crystal structure, morphology, and luminescent performance of the samples were investigated in detail with X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, decay curves, and internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Excited at 358 nm, these samples showed an intense deep-red emission band peaking at 688 nm in the wavelength region of 620-800 nm. The excitation spectra of these samples monitored at 688 nm exhibited two broad excitation bands from 250 to 600 nm with peaks at 358 and 469 nm. The systematic investigation of the concentration-dependent PL properties of BGT:Mn4+ phosphors revealed that the deep-red emission intensity reached the maximum when the Mn4+ doping concentration was 0.6 mol %. The critical distance (R c) between Mn4+ ions for concentration quenching was 36.57 Å, and the major mechanism of energy transfer among Mn4+ activators in BGT:Mn4+ was dipole-dipole interaction. The decay lifetimes decreased from 0.285 to 0.248 ms with the increasing Mn4+ doping concentration from 0.2 to 1.2 mol %. The Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage coordinates of the optimal BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample were (0.7294, 0.2706). The values of the IQE for all BGT:Mn4+ samples were measured, and the highest value could reach up to 62%. The above results revealed that these high-efficiency BGT:Mn4+ deep-red-emitting phosphors had promising potential for application in indoor plant growth lighting."

      "A mixed alkali-metal nonlinear optical (NLO) dihydro-cyanurate crystal Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O has been synthesized via the hydrothermal method. Its calculated birefringence is about 0.368, which is very large, its ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edge is down to 230 nm, and the powder second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity is about 0.2 × KDP. In addition, a first-principles investigation of the electronic properties on Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was carried out. The calculated band gap and SHG coefficient values agree well with the experimental ones. These results suggest that it could be applied as a UV birefringent material."

      "This study investigates magnetic ordering temperature in nano- and mesoscale structural features in an iron arsenide. Although magnetic ground states in quantum materials can be theoretically predicted from known crystal structures and chemical compositions, the ordering temperature is harder to pinpoint due to potential local lattice variations that calculations may not account for. In this work we find surprisingly that a locally disordered material can exhibit a significantly larger Néel temperature (TN) than an ordered material of precisely the same chemical stoichiometry. Here, a EuFe2As2 crystal, which is a '122' parent of iron arsenide superconductors, is found through synthesis to have ordering below TN = 195 K (for the locally disordered crystal) or TN = 175 K (for the ordered crystal). In the higher TN crystals, there are shorter planar Fe-Fe bonds [2.7692(2) Å vs. 2.7745(3) Å], a randomized in-plane defect structure, and diffuse scattering along the [00 L] crystallographic direction that manifests as a rather broad specific heat peak. For the lower TN crystals, the a-lattice parameter is larger and the in-plane microscopic structure shows defect ordering along the antiphase boundaries, giving a larger TN and a higher superconducting temperature (Tc) upon the application of pressure. First-principles calculations find a strong interaction between c-axis strain and interlayer magnetic coupling, but little impact of planar strain on the magnetic order. Neutron single-crystal diffraction shows that the low-temperature magnetic phase transition due to localized Eu moments is not lattice or disorder sensitive, unlike the higher-temperature Fe sublattice ordering. This study demonstrates a higher magnetic ordering point arising from local disorder in 122."

      "In this work, we present an integrated photogrammetric-acoustic technique that, together with the construction of a scaled wind tunnel, allows us to experimentally analyze the permeability behavior of a new type of acoustic screen based on a material called sonic crystal. Acoustic screens are devices used to reduce noise, mostly due to communication infrastructures, in its transmission phase from the source to the receiver. The main constructive difference between these new screens and the classic ones is that the first ones are formed by arrays of acoustic scatterers while the second ones are formed by continuous walls. This implies that, due to their geometry, screens based on sonic crystals are permeable to wind and water, unlike the classic ones. This fact may allow the use of these new screens in sandy soils, where sand would pass through the screen, avoiding the formation of sand dunes that are formed in classic screens and drastically reducing their acoustic performance. In this work, the movement of the sand and the resulting acoustic attenuation in these new screens are analyzed qualitatively, comparing the results with those obtained with the classic ones, and obtaining interesting results from the acoustic point of view."

      "In this work we present the novel atomic models of the (1 1 0)-(16 × 2), (1 1 0)-c(8 × 10), (1 1 0)-(5 × 8) and (17 15 1)-(2 × 1) silicon surface reconstructions. The models are also valid for respective germanium surfaces. The dataset reports atomic coordinates for each surface reconstruction and related calculated bias-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. The data were obtained using the standard first-principles density functional theory calculations. The atomic models reported in this dataset are based on the universal building block for (1 1 0)-family silicon and germanium surfaces, proposed by R.A. Zhachuk and A.A. Shklyaev [1] and a vast number of STM data published in the literature. For comparison the data for the Si(1 1 0)-(16 × 2) older models by Stekolnikov et al. [2] and Yamasaki et al. [3] are also given. The presented models and related calculated scanning tunneling microscopy images allow to derive experimentally testable hypotheses and to interpret the experimental data. The reported atomic coordinates can be directly reused in other calculations related to Si(1 1 0) and Ge(1 1 0) surfaces provided that this work is cited."

      "We investigate the oxygen conduction mechanism in a garnet-type oxide, Ca3Fe2Ge3O12, for the first time in detail by first-principle calculations. The nudged elastic band results confirm that this oxide has a lower migration barrier energy (0.45 eV) for an oxygen interstitial (Oi) with the kick-out mechanism than that (0.76 eV) for an oxygen vacancy. The migration paths for Oi are delocalized and connected to the neighboring cells in three-dimensional space. This oxide does not have a very low formation energy of Oi when the Fermi level is near the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital at a high temperature, which implies the possibility of electron doping by high-valence cations. These theoretical results suggest that the doping of Ca3Fe2Ge3O12 for generation of excess Oi provides a good oxygen-ion conductivity, along with the electronic conductivity."

      "Over last 15 years high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) have gained much appreciation for their numerous superior properties. In this paper we have shown a novel simulation methodology to realistically predict the nanometer level local structural features of complex Ta0.25Nb0.25Hf0.25Zr0.25 HEA. This involves prediction of the morphology of the short-range clustering (SRCs), their quantitative atomic composition at the nano level and the thermodynamic aspects. An alloy structure model containing 11664 atoms was created and this was subjected to structure evolution at 1800 °C. The structure evolution technique is based on a combined hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) approach. The simulated results from this work are further validated against experiments and material characterizations reported in literature and done by high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) for the nano-level microstructure, atom probe tomography (APT) for the local chemical compositions and X-ray diffraction at synchrotron sources for the local lattice relaxation effects. This work qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the materials characterization results reasonably well from the developed simulation methodologies. The structure evolution methods as described in this work are based on independent computer simulations and does not involve any manual intervention for input based on experiments on evolving SRCs. This work shows the potential of utilizing MC/MD based computational methods to reduce the number of costly experimental characterizations and accelerate the pace for materials development."

      "The focus of this paper is centered on the thermal reduction of KMnO4 at controlled temperatures of 400 and 800 °C. The materials under study were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, average oxidation state of manganese, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and impedance spectroscopy. The structural formulas, found as a result of these analyses, were K 0.29 + ( M n 0.84 4 + M n 0.16 3 + ) O 2.07 · 0.61 H 2 O and K 0.48 + ( M n 0.64 4 + M n 0.36 3 + ) O 2.06 · 0.50 H 2 O . The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms show the microporous and mesoporous nature of the structure. Structural analysis showed that synthesis temperature affects the crystal size and symmetry, varying their electrical properties. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) was used to measure the electrical properties of these materials. The measurements attained, as a result of IS, show that these materials have both electronic and ionic conductivity. The conductivity values obtained at 10 Hz were 4.1250 × 10-6 and 1.6870 × 10-4 Ω-1cm-1 for Mn4 at 298 and 423 K respectively. For Mn8, the conductivity values at this frequency were 3.7074 × 10-7 (298) and 3.9866 × 10-5 Ω-1cm-1 (423 K). The electrical behavior was associated with electron hopping at high frequencies, and protonic conduction and ionic movement of the K+ species, in the interlayer region at low frequencies."

      "In this paper, the columnar supramolecular aggregates of photosensitive star-shaped azobenzenes with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide core and azobenzene arms are analyzed theoretically by applying a combination of computer simulation techniques. Without a light stimulus, the azobenzene arms adopt the trans-state and build one-dimensional columns of stacked molecules during the first stage of the noncovalent association. These columnar aggregates represent the structural elements of more complex experimentally observed morphologies-fibers, spheres, gels, and others. Here, we determine the most favorable mutual orientations of the trans-stars in the stack in terms of (i) the π - π distance between the cores lengthwise the aggregate, (ii) the lateral displacements due to slippage and (iii) the rotation promoting the helical twist and chirality of the aggregate. To this end, we calculate the binding energy diagrams using density functional theory. The model predictions are further compared with available experimental data. The intermolecular forces responsible for the stability of the stacks in crystals are quantified using Hirshfeld surface analysis. Finally, to characterize the self-assembly mechanism of the stars in solution, we calculate the hydrogen bond lengths, the normalized dipole moments and the binding energies as functions of the columnar length. For this, molecular dynamics trajectories are analyzed. Finally, we conclude about the cooperative nature of the self-assembly of star-shaped azobenzenes with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide core in aqueous solution."

      "The interface structure between NaCl crystal and its solution has been investigated at the saturated concentration of 298 K by molecular dynamics simulations. We have found that there are many fine structures at this complex interface. Near the surface of crystal, most of Na+ only coordinate with water molecules, while almost all Cl- coordinate with Na+ in addition to water molecules. An ion coordinating with more water molecules is farther away from the epitaxial position of lattice. As approaching to the interface, the first hydration shell of ions has the tendency of being ordered, while the orientation of dipole of water molecules in the first hydration shell becomes more disordered than that in the solution. Generally, the first hydration shell of Na+ is less affected by nearest Cl-, whereas the first hydration shell of Cl- is significantly affected by nearest Na+."

      "The efficiencies of green and red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have been increased close to their theoretical upper limit, while the efficiency of blue PeLEDs is lagging far behind. Here we report enhancing the efficiency of sky-blue PeLEDs by overcoming a major hurdle of low photoluminescence quantum efficiency in wide-bandgap perovskites. Blending phenylethylammonium chloride into cesium lead halide perovskites yields a mixture of two-dimensional and three-dimensional perovskites, which enhances photoluminescence quantum efficiency from 1.1% to 19.8%. Adding yttrium (III) chloride into the mixture further enhances photoluminescence quantum efficiency to 49.7%. Yttrium is found to incorporate into the three-dimensional perovskite grain, while it is still rich at grain boundaries and surfaces. The yttrium on grain surface increases the bandgap of grain shell, which confines the charge carriers inside grains for efficient radiative recombination. Record efficiencies of 11.0% and 4.8% were obtained in sky-blue and blue PeLEDs, respectively."

      "Beryllium oxides have been extensively studied due to their unique chemical properties and important technological applications. Typically, in inorganic compounds beryllium is tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms. Herein based on results of in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction studies and ab initio calculations we report on the high-pressure behavior of CaBe2P2O8, to the best of our knowledge the first compound showing a step-wise transition of Be coordination from tetrahedral (4) to octahedral (6) through trigonal bipyramidal (5). It is remarkable that the same transformation route is observed for phosphorus. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the sequence of structural transitions of CaBe2P2O8 is associated with the electronic transformation from predominantly molecular orbitals at low pressure to the state with overlapping electronic clouds of anions orbitals."

      "The terminal diarsene HAs=AsH ligand attracts special interest concerning its bonding relation in comparison to its isolable relative, ethene. Herein, by the methanolysis of [{Fe(CO)4 }As(SiMe3 )3 ] (1) the synthesis of [{Fe(CO)4 }(η2 -As2 H2 )] (2) is reported, containing a parent diarsene as unprecedented side-on coordinated ligand. Following this synthetic route, also the D-labeled complex [{Fe(CO)4 }(η2 -As2 D2 )] (2D) could be isolated. The electronic structure and bonding situation of 2 was elucidated by DFT calculations revealing that 2 is best described as an olefin-like complex. Moreover, the reactivity of 2 towards the Lewis acids [{M(CO)5 }(thf)] (M=Cr, W) was investigated, leading to the complexes [Fe(CO)4 AsHW(CO)5 ]2 (3) and [{Fe(CO)4 }2 AsH{Cr(CO)5 }] (4), respectively."

      "Macroscopic behavior of materials depends on interactions of atoms and molecules at nanometer/sub-nanometer scale. Experimental mechanics (EM) can be used for assessing relationships between the macro world and the atomic realm. Theoretical models developed at nanometric and sub-nanometric scales may be verified using EM techniques with the final goal of deriving comprehensive but manageable models. Recently, the authors have carried out studies on EM determination of displacements and their derivatives at the macro and microscopic scales. Here, these techniques were applied to the analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy patterns of a crystalline array containing dislocations. Utilizing atomic positions as carriers of information and comparing undeformed and deformed configurations of observed area, displacements and their derivatives, as well as stresses, have been obtained in the Eulerian description of deformed crystal. Two approaches are introduced. The first establishes an analogy between the basic crystalline structure and a 120° strain gage rosette. The other relies on the fact that, if displacement information along three directions is available, it is possible to reconstruct the displacement field; all necessary equations are provided in the paper. Remarkably, the validity of the Cauchy-Born conjecture is proven to be correct within the range of observed deformations."

      "AgInTe2 compound has not received enough recognition in thermoelectrics, possibly due to the fact that the presence of Te vacancy (VTe) and antisite defect of In at Ag site (InAg) degrades its electrical conductivity. In this work, we prepared the Ag1-xInTe2 compounds with substoichiometric amounts of Ag and observed an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κL = 0.1 Wm-1K-1) for the sample at x = 0.15 and 814 K. This leads to more than 2-fold enhancement in the ZT value (ZT = 0.62) compared to the pristine AgInTe2. In addition, we have traced the origin of the untralow κL using the Callaway model. The results attained in this work suggest that the engineering of the silver vacancy (VAg) concentration is still an effective way to manipulate the thermoelectric performance of AgInTe2, realized by the increased point defects and modified crystal structure distortion as the VAg concentration increases."

      "Anisotropic 2D materials exhibit novel optical, electrical and thermoelectric properties that open possibilities for a great variety of angle-dependent devices. Recently, quantitative research on 1T'-WTe2 has been reported, revealing its fascinating physical properties such as non-saturating magnetoresistance, highly anisotropic crystalline structure and anisotropic optical/electrical response. Especially for its anisotropic properties, surging research interest devoted solely to understanding its structural and optical properties has been undertaken. Here we report quantitative, comprehensive work on the highly anisotropic, optical, electrical and optoelectronic properties of few-layer 1T'-WTe2 by azimuth-dependent reflectance difference microscopy, DC conductance measurements, as well as polarization-resolved and wavelength-dependent optoelectrical measurements. The electrical conductance anisotropic ratio is found to ≈103 for a thin 1T'-WTe2 film, while the optoelectronic anisotropic ratio is around 300 for this material. The polarization dependence of the photo-response is ascribed to the unique anisotropic in-plane crystal structure, consistent with the optical absorption anisotropy results. In general, 1T'-WTe2, with its highly anisotropic electrical and photoresponsivity reported here, demonstrates a route to exploit the intrinsic anisotropy of 2D materials and the possibility to open up new ways for applications of 2D materials for light polarization detection."

      "The crystal structure of η″-Fe3Al7+x , the low-temperature phase of η-Fe2Al5 with a composition on the Fe-rich side of the solid solubility range, has been determined by synchrotron X-ray single-crystal diffraction combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy. The η″ phase possesses commensurate long-period-ordered superlattice structures (space group Pmcn) based on the parent orthorhombic unit cell of η-Fe2Al5, consisting of twin domains (orientation variants) alternately stacked along the long-periodicity axis. Each of the twin domains possesses a motif structure belonging to the base-centered monoclinic space group C2/m, with a cell volume twice that of the parent orthorhombic unit cell (space group Cmcm). One-fourth of the c-axis chain sites corresponding to Al2- and Al3-sites in the η phase are respectively occupied by both Fe and Al atoms and exclusively by Al atoms in a regular manner. This regularity is disturbed in the twin-boundary region, giving rise to structural/compositional modulation. Because of the different chemical compositions between the motif structure and twin-boundary region, the η″ phase with various compositions can be constructed only by changing the number of the parent orthorhombic unit cells to be stacked along the orthorhombic c-axis, without changing the atomic arrangements for the motif structure or the twin boundary to account for the observed solid solubility range. The chemical formula of the η″ phase can thus be expressed as Fe3Al7+x under a simple assumption on the occupancies for Al/Fe atoms in the c-axis chain sites."

      "The charge characteristics of montmorillonite have significant effects on its hydration and application performances. In this study, a molecular dynamics simulation method was used to study the influence of the charge position and charge density of montmorillonite on the distribution of H2O and Ca2+ in layers. The results showed that when the layer charge is mainly derived from the substitution among ions in the tetrahedron, a large number of Hw and Ot are combined into a hydrogen bond in the interlayer, thus the water molecules are more compactly arranged and the diffusion of water molecules among the layers is reduced. In addition, the Ca2+ are diffused to the sides by a concentrated distribution in the central axis of the layer. As the charge density of the montmorillonite increases, the polarity of the Si-O surface increases, which lesds to the deterioration of the diffusibility of the water molecules and the structure of the water molecules in the interlayers is more stable. The increase in the layer charge density lesds to the expansion of the isomorphic substitution range of the crystal structure, which results in a more dispersed distribution of Ca2+ among the layers under the action of electrostatic attraction between the substituted negative sites and the Ca2+."

      "We study a system of active particles with soft repulsive interactions that lead to an active cluster-crystal phase in two dimensions. We use two different modelizations of the active force - Active Brownian particles (ABP) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUP) - and focus on analogies and differences between them. We study the different phases appearing in the system, in particular, the formation of ordered patterns drifting in space without being altered. We develop an effective description which captures some properties of the stable clusters for both ABP and AOUP. As an additional point, we confine such a system in a large channel, in order to study the interplay between the cluster crystal phase and the well-known accumulation near the walls, a phenomenology typical of active particles. For small activities, we find clusters attached to the walls and deformed, while for large values of the active force they collapse in stripes parallel to the walls."

      "The ground-state α phase of plutonium has an extraordinary 16-atom per cell, monoclinic crystal structure defined by 20 parameters, including the cell dimensions, not dictated by the symmetry. The electronic, magnetic, and elastic properties of this complicated material have been predicted in the past but here we compute its phonon spectra. Employing a density-functional-theory (DFT) model, that is fully relativistic and accounts for orbital-orbital coupling (orbital polarization, OP), we determine the phonon density of states of α-plutonium and find good agreement with inelastic x-ray scattering. The calculated specific heat also compares very favorably with experiment. An analysis of the partial atom-projected phonon spectra suggests that atom type 8, that is located in a more open space of the structure, dominates the intensity at very high phonon frequencies. This feature of the model is essential for a good agreement with the experimental spectra. The satisfactory comparison between theory and experiment for the phonons and specific heat suggests that the DFT (+OP) approach is appropriate and accurate for α-plutonium."

      "The development of novel photocathode materials for ultra-bright electron sources demands efficient and cost-effective strategies that provide insight and understanding of the intrinsic material properties given the constraints of growth and operational conditions. To address this question, we propose a viable way to establish correlations between calculated and measured data on core electronic states of Cs-K-Sb materials. To do so, we combine first-principles calculations based on all-electron density-functional theory on the three alkali antimonides Cs3Sb, Cs2KSb, and CsK2Sb with x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) on Cs-K-Sb photocathode samples. Within the GW approximation of many-body perturbation theory, we obtain quantitative predictions of the band gaps of these materials, which range from 0.57 eV in Cs2KSb to 1.62 eV in CsK2Sb and manifest direct or indirect character depending on the relative potassium content. Our theoretical electronic-structure analysis also reveals that the core states of these systems have binding energies that depend only on the atomic species and their crystallographic sites, with largest shifts of the order of 2 eV and 0.5 eV associated to K 2p and Sb 3d states, respectively. This information can be correlated to the maxima in the XPS survey spectra, where such peaks are clearly visible. In this way, core-level shifts can be used as fingerprints to identify specific compositions of Cs-K-Sb materials and their relation with the measured values of quantum efficiency. Our results represent the first step towards establishing a robust connection between the experimental preparation and characterization of photocathodes, the ab initio prediction of their electronic structure, and the modeling of emission and beam formation processes."

      "The section of the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (http://www.cryst.ehu.es) dedicated to subperiodic groups includes a new tool called LSITESYM for the study of materials with layer and multilayer symmetry. This new program, based on the site-symmetry approach, establishes the symmetry relations between localized and extended crystal states using representations of layer groups. The efficiency and utility of the program LSITESYM is demonstrated by illustrative examples, which include the analysis of phonon symmetry in Aurivillius compounds and in van der Waals layered crystals MoS2 and WS2."

      "The tailored (computational) design of materials addressing future challenges requires a thorough understanding of their electronic structures. This becomes very apparent for a given material existing in a certain homogeneity range, as its particular composition influences its electronic structure and, eventually, its physical properties. This led us to explore the influence and, furthermore, the origin of vacancies in the crystal structures of rock salt-type superconductors by means of quantum-chemical techniques. In doing so, we examined the vibrational properties, electronic band structures, and nature of bonding for a series of superconducting transition-metal sulfides, i.e., MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), which were identified to exist over certain homogeneity ranges. The outcome of our research indicates that the subtle competing interplay between two electronically unfavorable situations at the Fermi levels, i.e., the occupations of flat bands and the populations of antibonding states, appears to control the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of the sulfides."

      "Under the anomalous transmission condition in the Bragg mode, X-ray interference fringes were observed between two beams with different hyperbolic trajectories in a very weakly bent plane-parallel perfect crystal with negative strain gradient. The origin of the fringes was analysed based on the dynamical theory of diffraction for a distorted crystal. In the reflected beam from the entrance surface, the interference fringes were observed between once- and twice-reflected beams from the back surface. In the transmitted beam from the back surface, the interference fringes were observed between the direct beam and once-reflected beam from the entrance surface. In the emitted beam from the lateral surface, the interference fringes were observed between the beams after different numbers of reflections in the crystal. The multiply reflected beams were formed by a combined result of long propagation length along the beam direction with large divergence of the refracted beams when the strain gradient was negative. The period of these interference fringes was sensitive to very weak strain, of the order of 10-7."

      "What ideal w-LED phosphors always aim to do is to achieve a single phase near-sunlight emission phosphor simultaneously with both high luminescence efficiency and high thermal stability at operation temperature. And It is well known that apatite compound phosphors are one of the most promising optical materials to realize those above because of their unique structure enhanced luminescence properties and thermal stability. Here, we synthesized a co-doped single phase apatite phosphors Ca2La8(SiO4)6O2:Dy3+/Sm3+ (CLSO:Dy3+/Sm3+) for white light emission, which was provided with excellent thermal stability and of which luminescence intensity at 150 °C still was 92 percentage of that at room temperature. Moreover, X-ray diffraction technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope were employed to characterization of phase structure and morphology, and consequently pure apatite structure and gravel-like morphology of phosphors were proved. Analysis of photoluminescence spectra indicated that concentration quenching effect exist in single-doped CLSO:Dy3+ phosphors owing to dipole-dipole interaction between Dy3+ ions. It is revealed that maybe exist Dy3+ ↔ Sm3+ bilateral non-radiative energy transfer processes in Dy3+/Sm3+ co-doped CLSO system by PL spectra and decay curves. And variation of Sm3+ ion concentration can control color emission, namely CIE chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature, finally to achieve white light emission (0.309,0.309) with CCT 6848 K, able to be a potential candidate for commercial lighting applications."

      "Using field-theoretic simulations based on a self-consistent field theory (SCFT) with or without finite compressibility, nanoscale mesophase formation in molten linear AB and ABC block copolymers is investigated in search of candidates for new and useful nanomaterials. At selected compositions and segregation strengths, the copolymers are shown to evolve into some new nanostructures with either unusual crystal symmetry or a peculiar morphology. There exists a holey layered morphology with Im3 symmetry, which lacks one mirror reflection compared with Im3m symmetry. Also, a peculiar cubic bicontinuous morphology, whose channels are connected with tetrapod units, is found to have Pn3m symmetry. It is shown that there is another network morphology with tripod connections, which reveals P432 symmetry. The optimized free energies of these new mesophases and their relative stability are discussed in comparison with those of double gyroids and double diamonds."

      "Three co-formers of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (CNA), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and 4,4'-biphenol (DOD) were selected to prepare the co-crystal of progesterone (PROG) based on crystal engineering strategies. These co-crystals were successfully obtained via slow evaporation from different solutions and were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Different binding networks were observed in the co-crystal structures of PROG. The PROG-CNA co-crystal had the fastest rates and highest concentrations of PROG in PBS solution compared with PROG or other co-crystals in the dissolution experiments. This might be attributable to more stable and abundant interactions between the PROG and CNA molecules. Our investigations provide positive support for the selection of suitable co-formers using crystal engineering strategies."

      "The paper proposes a fully optical method for determination of a cubic crystal grain orientation in a sample inspected by a Raman microscope. The method is based on a universal and strong polarisation anisotropy of the Raman scattering by doubly degenerate optic phonon modes and it only requires a standard Raman microscope equipped with a polarisation analysis. Explicit formulas for the orientation of the crystal grain are derived. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by comparing grain orientations in a polycrystalline cubic lacunar spinel GaV4S8 determined independently using electron backscatter diffraction and Raman scattering methods."

      "A recent bioinformatic analysis of well-characterized classes of riboswitches uncovered subgroups unable to bind to the regulatory molecule of the parental class. Within the guanine/adenine class, seven groups of RNAs were identified that deviate from the consensus sequence at one or more of three positions directly involved purine nucleobase recognition, one of which was validated as a second class of 2'-deoxyguanosine riboswitch (called 2'-dG-II). To understand how 2'-dG-II riboswitches recognize their cognate ligand and how they differ from a previously identified class of 2'-deoxyguanosine binding riboswitches, we have solved the crystal structure of a 2'-dG-II aptamer domain bound to 2'-deoxyguanosine. This structure reveals a global architecture similar to other members of the purine riboswitch family, but contains key differences within the ligand binding core. Defining the 2'-dG-II riboswitches is a two-nucleotide insertion in the three-way junction that promotes novel base-base interactions. Unlike 2'-dG-I riboswitches, the 2'-dG-II class only requires local changes to the ligand binding pocket of the guanine/adenine class to achieve a change in ligand preference. Notably, members of the 2'-dG-II family have variable ability to discriminate between 2'-deoxyguanosine and riboguanosine, suggesting that a subset of 2'-dG-II riboswitches may bind either molecule to regulate gene expression."

      "Binary silicon boride SiB3 has been reported to occur in two forms, as disordered and nonstoichiometric α-SiB3-x , which relates to the α-rhombohedral phase of boron, and as strictly ordered and stoichiometric β-SiB3. Similar to other boron-rich icosahedral solids, these SiB3 phases represent potentially interesting refractory materials. However, their thermal stability, formation conditions, and thermodynamic relation are poorly understood. Here, we map the formation conditions of α-SiB3-x and β-SiB3 and analyze their relative thermodynamic stabilities. α-SiB3-x is metastable (with respect to β-SiB3 and Si), and its formation is kinetically driven. Pure polycrystalline bulk samples may be obtained within hours when heating stoichiometric mixtures of elemental silicon and boron at temperatures 1200-1300 °C. At the same time, α-SiB3-x decomposes into SiB6 and Si, and optimum time-temperature synthesis conditions represent a trade-off between rates of formation and decomposition. The formation of stable β-SiB3 was observed after prolonged treatment (days to weeks) of elemental mixtures with ratios Si/B = 1:1-1:4 at temperatures 1175-1200 °C. The application of high pressures greatly improves the kinetics of SiB3 formation and allows decoupling of SiB3 formation from decomposition. Quantitative formation of β-SiB3 was seen at 1100 °C for samples pressurized to 5.5-8 GPa. β-SiB3 decomposes peritectoidally at temperatures between 1250 and 1300 °C. The highly ordered nature of β-SiB3 is reflected in its Raman spectrum, which features narrow and distinct lines. In contrast, the Raman spectrum of α-SiB3-x is characterized by broad bands, which show a clear relation to the vibrational modes of isostructural, ordered B6P. The detailed composition and structural properties of disordered α-SiB3-x were ascertained by a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and 29Si magic angle spinning NMR experiments. Notably, the compositions of polycrystalline bulk samples (obtained at T ≤ 1200 °C) and single crystal samples (obtained from Si-rich molten Si-B mixtures at T > 1400 °C) are different, SiB2.93(7) and SiB2.64(2), respectively. The incorporation of Si in the polar position of B12 icosahedra results in highly strained cluster units. This disorder feature was accounted for in the refined crystal structure model by splitting the polar position into three sites. The electron-precise composition of α-SiB3-x is SiB2.5 and corresponds to the incorporation of, on average, two Si atoms in each B12 icosahedron. Accordingly, α-SiB3-x constitutes a mixture of B10Si2 and B11Si clusters. The structural and phase stability of α-SiB3-x were explored using a first-principles cluster expansion. The most stable composition at 0 K is SiB2.5, which however is unstable with respect to the decomposition β-SiB3 + Si. Modeling of the configurational and vibrational entropies suggests that α-SiB3-x only becomes more stable than β-SiB3 at temperatures above its decomposition into SiB6 and Si. Hence, we conclude that α-SiB3-x is metastable at all temperatures. Density functional theory electronic structure calculations yield band gaps of similar size for electron-precise α-SiB2.5 and β-SiB3, whereas α-SiB3 represents a p-type conductor."

      "The Ag-Li system was analysed using first-principles calculations 10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152811 [1]. The method included using density functional theory to optimize the crystal structure of the phases constituting the binary phase diagram by relaxing atomic positions, volume, and shape. The optimized structures were subsequently used to calculate thermodynamic properties at different temperatures; by determining the zero-point energy, the vibrational internal energy, and the entropy, the heat capacity at constant volume was obtained as well as the phases' stability limits. Furthermore, optimized structures were used to calculate the XRD patterns and to compare them with experimental data. All the referred data are now accessible to researchers and industrials demanding to work with binary and higher-order systems that include Ag and Li, for example, for energy storage. Binaries should be well assessed prior to higher-order phase diagrams and in that resides additional usefulness to this data."

      "Eu2+-activated phosphors are widely applied in lighting and display areas because of their good optical performance. In this paper, an excellent green-emitting zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor is prepared by a green and eco-friendly high-thermal reaction method without any reducing atmosphere or agents. Meanwhile, the reducing mechanism from Eu3+ ions to Eu2+ ions is investigated. The experiment results show that the morphology, crystal structure, and luminescent property are affected by sintering temperature. The resulting sample shows the broad excitation band is in the range of 310-450 nm and the peak of the broad emission band is located at 523 nm. Furthermore, zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor is encapsulated on a commercial UV-emitting chip to fabricate a purity green light-emitting diode (LED) with the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates at (0.295, 0.537)."

      "The 1H chemical shielding anisotropy (CSA) is an NMR parameter that is exquisitely sensitive to the local environment of protons in crystalline systems, but it is difficult to obtain it experimentally due to the need to concomitantly suppress other anisotropic interactions in the solid-state NMR (SSNMR) pulse sequences. The SSNMR measurements of the 1H CSA are particularly challenging if the fast magic-angle-spinning (MAS) is applied. It is thus important to confront the results of both the single-crystal (SC) and fast-MAS experiments with their theoretical counterparts. Here the plane-waves (PW) DFT calculations have been carried out using two functionals in order to precisely characterize the structures and the 1H NMR chemical shielding tensors (CSTs) of the solid forms of maleic, malonic, and citric acids, and of L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate. The level of agreement between the PW DFT and either SC or fast-MAS SSNMR 1H CSA data has been critically compared. It has been found that for the eigenvalues of the 1H CSTs provided by the fast-MAS measurements, an accuracy limit of current PW DFT predictions is about two ppm in terms of the standard deviation of the linear regression model, and sources of this error have been thoroughly discussed."

      "In this work the influence of the Ga3+ concentration on the luminescent properties and the abilities of the Y3Al5-xGaxO12: V nanocrystals to noncontact temperature sensing were investigated. It was shown that the increase of the Ga3+ amount enables enhancement of V4+ emission intensity in respect to the V3+ and V5+ and thus modify the color of emission. The introduction of Ga3+ ions provides the appearance of the crystallographic sites, suitable for V4+ occupation. Consequently, the increase of V4+ amount facilitates V5+ → V4+ interionic energy transfer throughout the shortening of the distance between interacting ions. The opposite thermal dependence of V4+ and V5+ emission intensities enables to create the bandshape luminescent thermometr of the highest relative sensitivity of V-based luminescent thermometers reported up to date (Smax, 2.64%/°C, for Y3Al2Ga3O12 at 0 °C). An approach of tuning the performance of Y3Al5-xGaxO12: V nanocrystals to luminescent temperature sensing, including the spectral response, maximal relative sensitivity and usable temperature range, by the Ga3+ doping was presented and discussed."

This workflow is applied to a database of 324 covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) reported in the literature, to characterize their CO2 adsorption properties using the following steps: (1) optimization of the crystal structure (atomic positions and unit cell) using density functional theory, (2) fitting atomic point charges based on the electron density, (3) characterizing the pore geometry of the structures before and after optimization, (4) computing carbon dioxide and nitrogen isotherms using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations with an empirical interaction potential, and finally, (5) assessing the CO2 parasitic energy via process modeling. The full workflow has been encoded in the Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA). Both the workflow and the automatically generated provenance graph of our calculations are made available on the Materials Cloud, allowing peers to inspect every input parameter and result along the workflow, download structures and files at intermediate stages, and start their research right from where this work has left off. In particular, our set of CURATED (Clean, Uniform, and Refined with Automatic Tracking from Experimental Database) COFs, having optimized geometry and high-quality DFT-derived point charges, are available for further investigations of gas adsorption properties. We plan to update the database as new COFs are being reported."

      "Industrially relevant catalytically active surfaces exhibit defects. These defects serve as active sites; expose incoming adsorbates to both high and low coordinated surface atoms; determine morphology, reactivity, energetics, and surface relaxation. These, in turn, affect crystal growth, oxidation, catalysis, and corrosion. Systematic experimental analyses of such surface defects pose challenges, esp., when they do not exhibit order. High Miller index surfaces can provide access to these features and information, albeit indirectly. Here, we show that with quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (QLEED) intensity analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we can visualize the local atomic configuration, the corresponding electron distribution, and local reactivity. The QLEED-determined Cu(410) structure (Pendry reliability factor RP ≃ 0.0797) exhibits alternating sequences of expansion (+) and contraction (-) (of the first 16 atomic interlayers) relative to the bulk-truncated interlayer spacing of ca. 0.437 Å. The corresponding electron distribution shows smoothening relative to the bulk-determined structure. These results should aid us to further gain an atomic-scale understanding of the nature of defects in materials."

      "Metallic nanoplates have attracted widespread interests owing to their functional versatility, which relies heavily on their morphologies. In this study, the shape stability of several metallic nanoplates with body-centered-cubic (bcc) lattices is investigated by employing molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the nanoplate with (110) surface planes is the most stable compared to the ones with (111) and (001) surfaces, and their shapes evolve with different patterns as the temperature increases. The formation of differently orientated facets is observed in the (001) nanoplates, which leads to the accumulation of shear stress and thus results in the subsequent formation of saddle shape. The associated shape evolution is quantitatively characterized. Further simulations suggest that the shape stability could be tuned by facet orientations, nanoplate sizes (including diameter and thickness), and components."

      "We present exact solutions of an energy spectrum of 2-interacting particles in which they seem to be relativistic fermions in 2 + 1 space-time dimensions. The 2 × 2 spinor equations of 2-interacting fermions through general central potential were separated covariantly into the relative and center of mass coordinates. First of all, the coupled first order differential equations depending on radial coordinate were derived from 2 × 2 spinor equations. Then, a second order radial differential equation was obtained and solved for Coulomb interaction potential. We apply our solutions to exciton phenomena for a free-standing monolayer medium. Since we regard exciton as isolated 2-interacting fermions in our model, any other external effect such as substrate was eliminated. Our results show that the obtained binding energies in our model are in agreement with the literature. Moreover, the decay time of an exciton was found out spontaneously in our calculations."

      "Gas hydrates consist of hydrogen-bonded water frameworks enclosing guest gas molecules and have been the focus of intense research for almost 40 y, both for their fundamental role in the understanding of hydrophobic interactions and for gas storage and energy-related applications. The stable structure of methane hydrate above 2 GPa, where CH4 molecules are located within H2O or D2O channels, is referred to as methane hydrate III (MH-III). The stability limit of MH-III and the existence of a new high-pressure phase above 40 to 50 GPa, although recently conjectured, remain unsolved to date. We report evidence for a further high-pressure, room-temperature phase of the CH4-D2O hydrate, based on Raman spectroscopy in diamond anvil cell and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations including nuclear quantum effects. Our results reveal that a methane hydrate IV (MH-IV) structure, where the D2O network is isomorphic with ice Ih, forms at ∼40 GPa and remains stable up to 150 GPa at least. Our proposed MH-IV structure is fully consistent with previous unresolved X-ray diffraction patterns at 55 GPa [T. Tanaka et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 104701 (2013)]. The MH-III → MH-IV transition mechanism, as suggested by the simulations, is complex. The MH-IV structure, where methane molecules intercalate the tetrahedral network of hexagonal ice, represents the highest-pressure gas hydrate known up to now. Repulsive interactions between methane and water dominate at the very high pressure probed here and the tetrahedral topology outperforms other possible arrangements in terms of space filling."

      "The hybrid perovskites are coordination frameworks with the same topology as the inorganic perovskites, but with properties driven by different chemistry, including host-framework hydrogen bonding. Like the inorganic perovskites, these materials exhibit many different phases, including structures with potentially exploitable functionality. However, their phase transformations under pressure are more complex and less well understood. We have studied the structures of manganese and cobalt guanidinium formate under pressure using single-crystal X-ray and powder neutron diffraction. Under pressure, these materials transform to a rhombohedral phase isostructural to cadmium guanidinium formate. This transformation accommodates the reduced cell volume while preserving the perovskite topology of the framework. Using density-functional theory calculations, we show that this behaviour is a consequence of the hydrogen-bonded network of guanidinium ions, which act as struts protecting the metal formate framework against compression within their plane. Our results demonstrate more generally that identifying suitable host-guest hydrogen-bonding geometries may provide a route to engineering hybrid perovskite phases with desirable crystal structures. This article is part of the theme issue 'Mineralomimesis: natural and synthetic frameworks in science and technology'."

      "The structural competing and atomic ordering of the full Heusler compounds Fe2NiSi and Ni2FeSi under uniform and tetragonal strains have been systematically studied by the first-principles calculation. Both Fe2NiSi and Ni2FeSi have the XA structure in cubic phase and they show metallic band structures and large magnetic moments (greater than 3μ B ) at equilibrium condition. Tetragonal distortion can further decrease the total energy, leading to the possible phase transformation. Furthermore, different atom reordering behaviours have been observed: for Fe2NiSi, atoms reorder from cubic XA-type to tetragonal L10-type; for Ni2FeSi, there is only structural transformation without atom reordering. The total magnetic moments of Fe2NiSi and Ni2FeSi are mainly contributed by Fe atoms, and Si atom can strongly suppress the moments of Fe atoms when it is present in the nearest neighbours of Fe atoms. With the applied strain, the distance between Fe and Si atoms play an important role for the magnetic moment variation of Fe atom. Moreover, the metallic band nature is maintained for Fe2NiSi and Ni2FeSi under both uniform and tetragonal strains. This study provides a detailed theoretical analysis about the full Heusler compounds Fe2NiSi and Ni2FeSi under strain conditions."

      "Using an effective genetic algorithm, we uncover the structure of a metastable Al41Sm5 phase that supplements its family sharing similar short-range orders. The phase evolves upon heating an amorphous Al-9.7 at.% Sm ribbon, produced by melt-spinning. The dynamical phase selection is discussed with respect to the structural connections between the short-range packing motifs in the amorphous precursor and those observed in the selected phases. The phase elucidated here is one of several newly discovered large-unit-cell phases found to form during devitrification from the glass in this binary system, further illustrating the power and efficiency of our approach, the important role of structural hierarchy in phase selection, and the richness of the metastable phase landscape accessible from the glassy structure."

      "The most widely used antimalarial drugs belong to the quinoline family. Their mode of action has not been characterized at the molecular level in vivo. We report the in vivo mode of action of a bromo analog of the drug chloroquine in rapidly frozen Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells. The Plasmodium parasite digests hemoglobin, liberating the heme as a byproduct, toxic to the parasite. It is detoxified by crystallization into inert hemozoin within the parasitic digestive vacuole. By mapping such infected red blood cells with nondestructive X-ray microscopy, we observe that bromoquine caps hemozoin crystals. The measured crystal surface coverage is sufficient to inhibit further hemozoin crystal growth, thereby sabotaging heme detoxification. Moreover, we find that bromoquine accumulates in the digestive vacuole, reaching submillimolar concentration, 1,000-fold more than that of the drug in the culture medium. Such a dramatic increase in bromoquine concentration enhances the drug's efficiency in depriving heme from docking onto the hemozoin crystal surface. Based on direct observation of bromoquine distribution in the digestive vacuole and at its membrane surface, we deduce that the excess bromoquine forms a complex with the remaining heme deprived from crystallization. This complex is driven toward the digestive vacuole membrane, increasing the chances of membrane puncture and spillage of heme into the interior of the parasite."

      "Lithium-bearing brines are an increasingly attractive source of Li for extraction. One extraction mechanism is the removal of Li from the fluid phase through the precipitation of zabuyelite (Li2CO3). The chemistry of the brine plays an important role in this process because ions in solution can compete for the components of the Li-carbonate phase. Here we explore the effect of different brine components on the precipitation of zabuyelite using experiments and computational simulations. Crystals formed in all solutions showed morphological evidence for potential transformation from a precursor phase. Our study indicates that Ca2+ and SO4 2- are incorporated into the precipitated zabuyelite crystals. Sulfate also interacts directly with specific surfaces on the growing crystal and is expected to form ion pairs with Li+ in solution. Similarly, Na+ appears to form ion pairs in solution with the carbonate ion, slowing nucleation of zabuyelite in the experiments. K+ and Cl- may interact with the growing zabuyelite crystals but do not appear to affect zabuyelite nucleation and growth times. These experiments highlight the importance of understanding the solution chemistry on zabuyelite formation in order to predict the efficiency of extraction processes and the purity of the solids."

      "Irreversible phase transformation of layered structure into spinel structure is considered detrimental for most of the layered structure cathode materials. Here we report that this presumably irreversible phase transformation can be rendered to be reversible in sodium birnessite (NaxMnO2·yH2O) as a basic structural unit. This layered structure contains crystal water, which facilitates the formation of a metastable spinel-like phase and the unusual reversal back to layered structure. The mechanism of this phase reversibility was elucidated by combined soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy with X-ray diffraction, corroborated by first-principle calculations and kinetics investigation. These results show that the reversibility, modulated by the crystal water content between the layered and spinel-like phases during the electrochemical reaction, could activate new cation sites, enhance ion diffusion kinetics and improve its structural stability. This work thus provides in-depth insights into the intercalating materials capable of reversible framework changes, thereby setting the precedent for alternative approaches to the development of cathode materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries."

      "Magnetic ferrites are used in a wide range of technological applications, such as biomedicine, electronics, or energy. They also present interesting magnetic properties, especially for high-frequency applications. These materials have been prepared by a large variety of methods, from basic solid-state reaction to advanced wet chemical methods. However, most of these approaches are complex and have low production rates. In this work, a deep analysis of an easy polymer-assisted sol-gel synthesis of copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) nanoparticles is done. A multivariate analysis, by means of the design of experiments approach, is carried out to account for two variables at a time. Moreover, a wide experimental domain is explored, and the impact of each variable on the chemical composition and magnetic properties is determined. This work results in an optimization of the synthesis method to obtain high-purity nanoparticles (∼96%)."

As the primary blue diode is already highly optimized, the conversion phosphors are of crucial importance for any further improvements. We report on the discovery of the high performance red phosphor Sr[Li2Al2O2N2]:Eu2+ meeting all requirements for a phosphor's optical properties. It combines the optimal spectral position for a red phosphor, as defined in the 2016 Research & Development-plan of the United States government, with an exceptionally small spectral full width at half maximum and excellent thermal stability. A white mid-power phosphor-converted light-emitting diode prototype utilising Sr[Li2Al2O2N2]:Eu2+ shows an increase of 16% in luminous efficacy compared to currently available commercial high colour-rendering phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes, while retaining excellent high colour rendition. This phosphor enables a big leap in energy efficiency of white emitting phosphor-converted light-emitting-diodes."

      "Understanding the behavior and properties of molecules assembled in thin layers requires knowledge of their crystalline packing. The drug phenytoin (5,5-diphenylhydantoin) is one of the compounds that can be grown as a surface induced polymorph. By using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, the monoclinic unit cell of the new form II can be determined, but, due to crystal size and the low amount of data, a full solution using conventional structure solving strategies fails. In this work, the full solution has been obtained by combining computational structure generation and experimental results. The comparison between the bulk and the new surface induced phase reveals significant packing differences of the hydrogen-bonding network, which might be the reason for the faster dissolution of form II with respect to form I. The results are very satisfactory, and the method might be adapted for other systems, where, due to the limited amount of experimental data, one must rely on additional approaches to gain access to more detailed information to understand the solid-state behavior."

      "Phosphor-converted white LEDs rely on combining a blue-emitting InGaN chip with yellow and red-emitting luminescent materials. The discovery of cyan-emitting (470-500 nm) phosphors is a challenge to compensate for the spectral gap and produce full-spectrum white light. Na0.5K0.5Li3SiO4:Eu2+ (NKLSO:Eu2+) phosphor was developed with impressive properties, providing cyan emission at 486 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 20.7 nm, and good thermal stability with an integrated emission loss of only 7% at 150 °C. The ultra-narrow-band cyan emission results from the high-symmetry cation sites, leading to almost ideal cubic coordination for UCr4C4-type compounds. NKLSO:Eu2+ phosphor allows the valley between the blue and yellow emission peaks in the white LED device to be filled, and the color-rendering index can be enhanced from 86 to 95.2, suggesting great applications in full-spectrum white LEDs."

      "As the restaurant industry is facing labor shortage issues, the use of meal delivery robots instead of waiters/waitresses not only allows the customers to experience the impact of robot technology but also benefits the restaurant business financially by reducing labor costs. Most existing meal delivery robots employ magnetic navigation technologies, which require magnetic strip installation and changes to the restaurant decor. Once the moving path is changed, the magnetic strips need to be re-laid. This study proposes multisource information fusion, i.e., the fusion of ultra-wide band positioning technology with an odometer and a low-cost gyroscope accelerometer, to achieve the positioning of a non-rail meal delivery robot with navigation. By using a low-cost electronic compass and gyroscope accelerometer, the delivery robot can move along a fixed orbit in a flexible and cost-effective manner with steering control. Ultra-wide band (UWB) and track estimation algorithm are combined by extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the positioning error after fusion is about 15 cm, which is accepted by restaurants. In summary, the proposed approach has some potential for commercial applications."

      "New iron complexes [Cp*FeL]- (1-σ and 1-π, Cp*=C5 Me5 ) containing the chelating phosphinine ligand 2-(2'-pyridyl)-4,6-diphenylphosphinine (L) have been prepared, and found to undergo facile reaction with CO2 under ambient conditions. The outcome of this reaction depends on the coordination mode of the versatile ligand L. Interaction of CO2 with the isomer 1-π, in which L binds to Fe through the phosphinine moiety in an η5 fashion, leads to the formation of 3-π, in which CO2 has undergone electrophilic addition to the phosphinine group. In contrast, interaction with 1-σ-in which L acts as a σ-chelating [P,N] ligand-leads to product 3-σ in which one C=O bond has been completely broken. Such CO2 cleavage reactions are extremely rare for late 3d metals, and this represents the first such example mediated by a single Fe centre."

      "Phosphors can serve as color conversion layers to generate white light with varying optical features, including color rendering index (CRI), high correlated color temperature (CCT), and luminous efficacy. However, they are typically produced under harsh synthesis conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, and/or by employing a large amount of solvent. In this work, a facile, water-based, rapid method has been proposed to fabricate lanthanide-doped hydroxide-based phosphors. In this sense, sub-micrometer-sized Y(OH)3:Eu3+ particles (as red phosphor) were synthesized in water at ambient conditions in ≤60 min reaction time. The doping ratio was controlled from 2.5-20 mol %. Additionally, first principle calculations were performed on Y(OH)3:Eu3+ to understand the preferable doping scenario and its optoelectronic properties. As an application, these fabricated red phosphors were integrated into a PDMS/YAG:Ce3+ composite and used to generate white light. The resulting white light showed a remarkable improvement (≈24%) in terms of luminous efficiency, a slight reduction of CCT (from 3900 to 3600 K), and an unchanged CRI (≈60) as the amount of Y(OH)3:Eu3+ was increased."

      "The oxohydroxoferrates(III) A 2[Fe2O3(OH)2] (A=K, Rb, Cs) were synthesized under hydroflux conditions. Approximately equimolar mixtures of the alkali metal hydroxides and water were reacted with Fe(NO3)3 ⋅ 9H2O at about 200 °C. The product formation depends on the hydroxide concentration, therefore also other reaction products, such as KFeO2, K2-x[Fe4O7-x(OH)x] or α-Fe2O3, are obtained. The crystal structures of the oxohydroxoferrates(III) A 2[Fe2O3(OH)2] follow the same structural principle, yet differ in their layer stacking or/and their hydrogen bonding systems depending on A and temperature. In the resulting four different orthorhombic structure types, [FeO3OH]4- tetrahedra share their oxide corners to create folded   ∞  2 [   Fe2O3(OH)2]2- layers. The terminal hydroxide ligands form hydrogen bonds between and/or within the layers. The positions of the hydrogen atoms in these networks are correlated. The A + cations are located between the folded anionic layers as well as in their trenches. Under reaction conditions, the potassium compound crystallizes in the space group Cmce (Pearson symbol oC88), showing a bimodal disorder of the hydrogen atoms in hydrogen bridges. In a virtually hysteresis-less first-order transition at 340(2) K, the structure slightly distorts into the room-temperature modification with the subgroup Pbca (oP88), and the hydrogen atoms order. The rubidium and caesium compounds are isostructural to each other but not to the potassium compound, and are always obtained as mixtures of two modifications with space groups Cmce (oC88') and Immb (oI88). Upon heating, the oxohydroxoferrates decompose into their anhydrides AFeO2 and water. The type of hydrogen bonding network influences the decomposition temperature, the structure and the morphology of the crystals. Despite the presence of iron(III), which was confirmed by 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy, K2[Fe2O3(OH)2] is diamagnetic in the investigated temperature range between 1.8 and 300 K. Neutron diffraction revealed strong antiferromagnetic coupling of the magnetic moments, which are inverted in neighboring tetrahedra."

      "Four kinds of Ca-montmorillonite with different layer charge density were used to study the effect of charge density on their hydration properties by molecular dynamics simulation and experiments. The research results of Z-density distribution of water molecules, Hw (hydrogen in water molecules), and Ca in the interlayer of montmorillonite show that the hydration properties of montmorillonite are closely related to its layer charge density. If the charge density is low, the water molecules in the interlayers are mainly concentrated on the sides of the central axis about -1.3 Å and 1.5 Å. As the charge density increases from 0.38semi-cell to 0.69semi-cell, the water molecules are distributed -2.5 Å and 2.4 Å away from the siloxane surface (Si-O), the concentration of water molecules near the central axis decreases, and at the same time, Ca2+ appears to gradually shift from the vicinity of the central axis to the Si-O surface on both sides in the montmorillonite layer. The simulation results of the radial distribution function (RDF) of the Ca-Hw, Ca-Ow (oxygen in water molecules), and Ca-Ot (the oxygen in the tetrahedron) show that the Ca2+ and Ow are more tightly packed together than that of Hw; with the increase of the charge density, due to the fact that the negative charge sites on the Si-O surface increase, under the action of electrostatic attraction, some of the Ca2+ are pulled towards the Si-O surface, which is more obvious when the layer charge density of the montmorillonite is higher. The results of the RDF of the Ot-Hw show that with the increase of charge density, the number of hydrogen bonds formed by Ot and Hw in the interlayers increase, and under the action of hydrogen bonding force, the water molecules near the central axis are pulled towards the two sides of Si-O surface. As a result, the arrangement of water molecules is more compact, and the structure is obvious. Correspondingly, the self-diffusion coefficient shows that the higher the layer charge density, the lower the self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules in interlayers is and the worse the hydration performance of montmorillonite. The experimental results of the experiments fit well with the above simulation results."

      "The band inversion in topological phase matters bring exotic physical properties such as the topologically protected surface states (TSS). They strongly influence the surface electronic structures of the materials and could serve as a good platform to gain insight into the surface reactions. Here we synthesized high-quality bulk single crystals of Co3Sn2S2 that naturally hosts the band structure of a topological semimetal. This guarantees the existence of robust TSS from the Co atoms. Co3Sn2S2 crystals expose their Kagome lattice that constructed by Co atoms and have high electrical conductivity. They serves as catalytic centers for oxygen evolution process (OER), making bonding and electron transfer more efficient due to the partially filled orbital. The bulk single crystal exhibits outstanding OER catalytic performance, although the surface area is much smaller than that of Co-based nanostructured catalysts. Our findings emphasize the importance of tailoring TSS for the rational design of high-activity electrocatalysts."

      "The silicon-rich cage compound MgSi5 was obtained by high-pressure high-temperature synthesis. Initial crystal structure determination by electron diffraction tomography provided the basis for phase analyses in the process of synthesis optimization, finally facilitating the growth of single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments. The crystal structure of MgSi5 (space group Cmme, Pearson notation oS24, a=4.4868(2) Å, b=10.1066(5) Å, and c=9.0753(4) Å) constitutes a new type of framework of four-bonded silicon atoms forming Si15 cages enclosing the Mg atoms. Two types of smaller Si8 cages remain empty. The atomic interactions are characterized by two-center two-electron bonds within the silicon framework. In addition, there is evidence for multi-center Mg-Si bonding in the large cavities of the framework and for lone-pair-like interactions in the smaller empty voids."

      "Recently, we synthesized a one-dimensional (1D) structure of V2Se9. The 1D V2Se9 resembles another 1D material, Nb2Se9, which is expected to have a direct band gap. To determine the potential applications of this material, we calculated the band structures of 1D and bulk V2Se9 using density functional theory by varying the number of chains and comparing their band structures and electronic properties with those of Nb2Se9. The results showed that a small number of V2Se9 chains have a direct band gap, whereas bulk V2Se9 possesses an indirect band gap, like Nb2Se9. We expect that V2Se9 nanowires with diameters less than ∼20 Å would have direct band gaps. This indirect-to-direct band gap transition could lead to potential optoelectronic applications for this 1D material because materials with direct band gaps can absorb photons without being disturbed by phonons."

      "All-inorganic mixed-halide CsPb(Br1-x I x )3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are excellent candidates for green-emitting phosphors in wide color gamut displays; however, a detailed investigation of their photoluminescence (PL) properties based on the halide composition has been missing. In this work, we report a fundamental investigation of the changes in the PL properties of CsPb(Br1-x I x )3 NCs. The PL color of the NCs, which were prepared by a hot-injection method, changed from green to red with increasing iodide composition (x). Almost ideal green emission close to the chromaticity coordinates of the green vertex of the BT.2020 standard was achieved by appropriately substituting iodide ions for bromide ions in monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs. However, the PL peak width of the mix-halide NCs at x ∼ 0.5 was 0.127 eV, which was broader than the 0.105 eV peak width of the monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs. This phenomenon should be due to the compositional inhomogeneity among the individual CsPb(Br1-x I x )3 NCs. On the other hand, the PL quantum yield (PLQY) for the monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs decreased from 70 to 25% as x increased to 0.5. This result may be attributed to lattice distortion by the difference in the ionic radii of bromide and iodide. Improvements in the compositional inhomogeneity and lattice distortion would enhance the color purity of the green emission and the PLQY, respectively, of the CsPb(Br1-x I x )3 NCs."

      "In this work, the influencing factors and corresponding theoretical models for the surface topography in diamond turning process are reviewed. The surface profile on one tool feed is the elementary unit of surface topography. The influences coupled with the models of the duplication effect of the tool edge profile, material spring back, and plastic side flow are outlined in this part. In light of the surface profile on one tool feed and \"trim principle\", the modeling methods of surface topography along the radial direction (2D surface topography) are commented. Moreover, the influence of the vibration between the diamond tool and workpiece on the 2D surface topography is discussed, and the theoretical models are summarized. Finally, the issues for modeling of 3D surface topography, particularly the influences of material defects, are analyzed. According to the state-of-the-art surface topography model of the diamond turned component, future work in this field is therefore predicted."

      "Calcium carbonate is a relevant constituent of the Earth's crust that is transferred into the deep Earth through the subduction process. Its chemical interaction with calcium-rich silicates at high temperatures give rise to the formation of mixed silicate-carbonate minerals, but the structural behavior of these phases under compression is not known. Here we report the existence of a dense polymorph of Ca5(Si2O7)(CO3)2 tilleyite above 8 GPa. We have structurally characterized the two phases at high pressures and temperatures, determined their equations of state and analyzed the evolution of the polyhedral units under compression. This has been possible thanks to the agreement between our powder and single-crystal XRD experiments, Raman spectroscopy measurements and ab-initio simulations. The presence of multiple cation sites, with variable volume and coordination number (6-9) and different polyhedral compressibilities, together with the observation of significant amounts of alumina in compositions of some natural tilleyite assemblages, suggests that post-tilleyite structure has the potential to accommodate cations with different sizes and valencies."

      "Ti3Sn has received increasing attention as a high damping metallic material and as an anode material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. However, a heated dispute concerning the existence of solid state phase transformation of stoichiometric Ti3Sn impedes its development. Here, thermal-induced reversible phase transformation of Ti3Sn is demonstrated to happen at around 300 K by the means of in-situ variable-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Ti3Sn powder, which is also visible for bulk Ti3Sn on the thermal expansion curve by a turning at 330 K. The new phase's crystal structure of Ti3Sn is determined to be orthorhombic with a space group of Cmcm and the lattice parameters of a = 5.87 Å, b = 10.37 Å, c = 4.76 Å respectively, according to selected area electron diffraction patterns in transmission electron microscope (TEM) and XRD profiles. The hexagonal → orthorhombic phase transformation is calculated to be reasonable and consistent with thermodynamics theory. This work contributes to a growing knowledge of intermetallic Ti3Sn, which may provide fundamental insights into its damping mechanism."

      "Understanding the response of ceramics operating in extreme environments is of interest for a variety of applications. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations have been used to investigate the effect of structure and B-site (=Ti, Zr) cation composition of lanthanum-based oxides (La2B2O7) on electronic-excitation-induced amorphization. We find that the amorphous transition in monoclinic layered perovskite La2Ti2O7 occurs for a lower degree of electronic excitation than for cubic pyrochlore La2Zr2O7. While in each case the formation of O2-like molecules drives the structure to an amorphous state, an analysis of the polyhedral connection network reveals that the rotation of TiO6 octahedra in the monoclinic phase can promote such molecule formation, while such octahedral rotation is not possible in the cubic phase. However, once the symmetry of the cubic structure is broken by substituting Ti for Zr, it becomes less resistant to amorphization. A compound made of 50% Ti and 50% Zr (La2TiZrO7) is found to be more resistant in the monoclinic than in the cubic phase, which may be related to the lower bandgap of the cubic phase. These results illustrate the complex interplay of structure and composition that give rise to the radiation resistance of these important functional materials."

      "Hydrogen storage is widely recognized as one of the biggest not solved problem within hydrogen technologies. The slow development of the materials and systems for hydrogen storage has resulted in a slow spread of hydrogen applications. There are many families of materials that can store hydrogen; among them, the alanate family can be of interest. Basic research papers and reviews have been focused on alanates of group 1 and 2. However, there are many alanates of transition metals, main group, and lanthanides that deserve attention in a review. This work is a comprehensive compilation of all known alanates. The approaches towards tuning the kinetics and thermodynamics of alanates are also covered in this review. These approaches are the formation of reactive composites, double cation alanates, or anion substitution. The crystallographic and X-ray diffraction characteristics of each alanate are presented along with this review. In the final sections, a discussion of the infrared, Raman, and thermodynamics was included."

      "Study of arsenic (As) provides guidelines for the development of next-generation materials. We clarify the unique structure of the third crystalline polymorph of natural As (Pnm21-As) by crystallographical experiment and the electronic structure by first-principles computational method. The crystal structure of Pnm21-As is a novel structure in which the basic portions of semi-metalic grey-As and semi-conductor black-As are alternately arranged at the atomic level. For both covalent and van der Waals bonding, the contributions of sd and pd hybridizations are important. Van der Waals bonding characteristics and d orbital contributions can be varied by control of layer stacking. Total charges are clearly divided into positive and negative in the same elements for the grey-As and black-As portions, respectively, is of importance. The sequence in which one-dimensional electron donor and acceptor portions alternate in the layer will be the first description."

      "The Cu2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ complexes of a 14 membered macrocycle were synthesized and their antioxidant capacities were evaluated against ABTS and DPPH radicals, with the objective of collecting insights into the biomimetic role of the central metal ions. The macrocycle, abbreviated as H2L14, is a derivative of EDTA cyclized with 1,4-diamine, and the moderately flexible macrocyclic frame permits the formation of [ML14·H2O] chelates with octahedral coordination geometries common among the metal ions. The metal complexes were characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic methods, as well as thermogravimetric analysis; the octahedral coordination geometries with water coordination were optimized by DFT calculations. The antioxidant assays showed that [FeL14·H2O]+ was able to scavenge synthetic radicals with moderate capacity, whereas the other metal chelates did not show significant activity. The Raman spectrum of DPPH in solution suggests that interaction was operative between the Fe3+ chelate and the radical so as to cause scavenging capability. The nature of the central metal ions is a controlling factor for antioxidant capacity, as every metal chelate carries the same coordination geometry."

      "Spectroscopic detection of Dirac and Weyl fermions in real materials is vital for both, promising applications and fundamental bridge between high-energy and condensed-matter physics. While the presence of Dirac and noncentrosymmetric Weyl fermions is well established in many materials, the magnetic Weyl semimetals still escape direct experimental detection. In order to find a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl state we design two materials and present here experimental and theoretical evidence of realization of such a state in one of them, YbMnBi2. We model the time-reversal symmetry breaking observed by magnetization and magneto-optical microscopy measurements by canted antiferromagnetism and find a number of Weyl points. Using angle-resolved photoemission, we directly observe two pairs of Weyl points connected by the Fermi arcs. Our results not only provide a fundamental link between the two areas of physics, but also demonstrate the practical way to design novel materials with exotic properties."

      "Skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric magnets are vortex-like spin arrangements, viewed as potential candidates for information storage devices. The crystal structure and noncollinear magnetic structure together with magnetic and spin-orbit interactions define the symmetry of the skyrmion structure. We outline the importance of these parameters in the Heusler compound Mn1.4PtSn which hosts antiskyrmions, a vortex-like spin texture related to skyrmions. We overcome the challenge of growing large micro-twin-free single crystals of Mn1.4PtSn, which has proved to be the bottleneck for realizing bulk skyrmionic/antiskyrmionic states in a compound. The use of 5d-transition metal, platinum, together with manganese as constituents in the Heusler compound such as Mn1.4PtSn is a precondition for the noncollinear magnetic structure. Because of the tetragonal inverse Heusler structure, Mn1.4PtSn exhibits large magneto-crystalline anisotropy and D 2d symmetry, which are necessary for antiskyrmions. The superstructure in Mn1.4PtSn is induced by Mn-vacancies, which enable a ferromagnetic exchange interaction to occur. Mn1.4PtSn, the first known tetragonal Heusler superstructure compound, opens up a new research direction for properties related to the superstructure in a family containing thousands of compounds."

      "The physico-chemical processes supporting life's purposeful movement remain essentially unknown. Self-propelling chiral droplets offer a minimalistic model of swimming cells and, in surfactant-rich water, droplets of chiral nematic liquid crystals follow the threads of a screw. We demonstrate that the geometry of their trajectory is determined by both the number of turns in, and the handedness of, their spiral organization. Using molecular motors as photo-invertible chiral dopants allows converting between right-handed and left-handed trajectories dynamically, and droplets subjected to such an inversion reorient in a direction that is also encoded by the number of spiral turns. This motile behavior stems from dynamic transmission of chirality, from the artificial molecular motors to the liquid crystal in confinement and eventually to the helical trajectory, in analogy with the chirality-operated motion and reorientation of swimming cells and unicellular organisms."

      "This study proposes a novel direct-lit mini-chip-scale packaged light-emitting diode (mini-CSPLED) backlight unit (BLU) that used quantum dot (QD) film, diffusion plate, and two prism films to improve brightness uniformity. Three different luminous intensity units, 120° mini-CSPLED, 150° mini-CSPLED, and 180° mini-CSPLED with different emission angle structures were fabricated using a CSP process. In terms of component characteristics, although the 180° mini-CSPLED light output power is about loss 4% (at 10 mA) compared with 150° mini-CSPLED, it has a large emission angle that forms a planar light source that contributes to improving the BLU brightness uniformity and reduced quantity of LEDs at the same area. In terms of BLU analysis, the blue mini-CSPLEDs with different emission angles excite the different QD film thicknesses; the chromaticity coordinates conversion to the white light region. The BLU brightness increases as the QD film thickness increases from 60, 90, and 150 μm. This result can achieve a brightness uniformity of 86% in a 180° mini-CSPLED BLU + 150-μm-thick QD films as compared to the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU and 150° mini-CSPLED BLU."

      "Phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) are excellent energy-efficient light sources for artificial lighting applications. One goal of artificial lighting is to make objects/images look natural - as they look under the sunlight. The ability of a light source to accurately render the natural color of an object is gauged by the parameter - color rendering index (CRI). A conventional pc-WLED has an average CRI ~ 80, which is very low for accurate color reproduction. To utilize the pc-WLEDs for artificial lighting applications, all the CRI points (R1 - R15) should be above 95. However, there is a trade-off between CRI and luminous efficacy (LER), and it is challenging to increase both CRI and LER. Herein we propose a novel LED package (PKG) design to achieve CRI points ≥95 and efficiency ~100 lm/W by introducing two blue LEDs and a UV LED in combination with green and red phosphors. The silicone encapsulant, the current through the LEDs, and the green/red phosphor ratio were optimized for achieving high CRI and LER. Our re-designed LED PKG will find applications in stadium lighting as well as for ultra-high-definition television production where high CRI points are required for the artificial light source."

      "An alternative approach to hard-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) has been established. The instrumental key feature is an increase of the dimensionality of the recording scheme from 2D to 3D. A high-energy momentum microscope detects electrons with initial kinetic energies up to 8 keV with a k-resolution of 0.025 Å-1, equivalent to an angular resolution of 0.034°. A special objective lens with k-space acceptance up to 25 Å-1 allows for simultaneous full-field imaging of many Brillouin zones. Combined with time-of-flight (ToF) parallel energy recording this yields maximum parallelization. Thanks to the high brilliance (1013 hν s-1 in a spot of <20 µm diameter) of beamline P22 at PETRA III (Hamburg, Germany), the microscope set a benchmark in HAXPES recording speed, i.e. several million counts per second for core-level signals and one million for d-bands of transition metals. The concept of tomographic k-space mapping established using soft X-rays works equally well in the hard X-ray range. Sharp valence band k-patterns of Re, collected at an excitation energy of 6 keV, correspond to direct transitions to the 28th repeated Brillouin zone. Measured total energy resolutions (photon bandwidth plus ToF-resolution) are 62 meV and 180 meV FWHM at 5.977 keV for monochromator crystals Si(333) and Si(311) and 450 meV at 4.0 keV for Si(111). Hard X-ray photoelectron diffraction (hXPD) patterns with rich fine structure are recorded within minutes. The short photoelectron wavelength (10% of the interatomic distance) `amplifies' phase differences, making full-field hXPD a sensitive structural tool."

      "Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), due to their high quantum yield (QY), tunable bandgap, and simple preparation. However, the red-emitting perovskite QDs are usually containing iodine (I), which is not stable under continuous light irradiation. Herein, perovskite-based WLED is fabricated by lead-free bismuth (Bi)-doped inorganic perovskites Cs2SnCl6 and less-lead Mn-doped CsPbCl3 QDs, which emits white light with color coordinates of (0.334, 0.297). The Bi-doped Cs2SnCl6 and Mn-doped CsPbCl3 QDs both show excellent stability when kept in the ambient air. As benefits from this desired characteristic, the as-prepared WLED shows excellent stability along with operating time. These results can promote the application of inorganic perovskite QDs in the field of WLEDs."

      "Nanoscale cation exchange (CE) has resulted in colloidal nanomaterials that are unattainable by direct synthesis methods. Aliovalent CE is complex and synthetically challenging because the exchange of an unequal number of host and guest cations is required to maintain charge balance. An approach to control aliovalent CE reactions is the use of a single reactant to both supply the guest cation and extract the host cation. Here, we study the application of GaCl3-L complexes [L = trioctylphosphine (TOP), triphenylphosphite (TPP), diphenylphosphine (DPP)] as reactants in the exchange of Cu+ for Ga3+ in Cu2-xS nanocrystals. We find that noncomplexed GaCl3 etches the nanocrystals by S2- extraction, whereas GaCl3-TOP is unreactive. Successful exchange of Cu+ for Ga3+ is only possible when GaCl3 is complexed with either TPP or DPP. This is attributed to the pivotal role of the Cu2-xS-GaCl3-L activated complex that forms at the surface of the nanocrystal at the onset of the CE reaction, which must be such that simultaneous Ga3+ insertion and Cu+ extraction can occur. This requisite is only met if GaCl3 is bound to a phosphine ligand, with a moderate bond strength, to allow facile dissociation of the complex at the nanocrystal surface. The general validity of this mechanism is demonstrated by using GaCl3-DPP to convert CuInS2 into (Cu,Ga,In)S2 nanocrystals, which increases the photoluminescence quantum yield 10-fold, while blue-shifting the photoluminescence into the NIR biological window. This highlights the general applicability of the mechanistic insights provided by our work."

      "BACKGROUND:Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) is an open-source library for PET and SPECT image reconstruction, implementing iterative reconstruction as well as 2D- and 3D-filtered back projection. Quantitative reconstruction of PET data requires the knowledge of the scanner geometry. Typical scanners, clinical as well as pre-clinical ones, use a block-type geometry. Several rectangular blocks of crystals are arranged into regular polygons. Multiple of such polygons are arranged along the scanner axis. However, the geometrical representation of a scanner provided by STIR is a cylinder made of rings of individual crystals equally distributed in axial and transaxial directions. The data of realistic scanners are projected onto such virtual scanners prior to image reconstruction. This results in reduced quality of the reconstructed image. In this study, we implemented the above-described block geometry into the STIR library, permitting the image reconstruction without the interpolation step. In order to evaluate the difference in image quality, we performed Monte Carlo simulation studies of three different scanner designs: two scanners with multiple crystals per block and one with a single crystal per block. Simulated data were reconstructed using the standard STIR method and the newly implemented block geometry. RESULTS:Visual comparison between the images reconstructed by the two models for the block-type scanners shows that the new implementation enhances the image quality to the extent that the results before normalization correction are comparable with those after normalization correction. The simulation result of a uniform cylinder shows that the coefficient of variation decreases from 25.8% to 20.9% by using the new implementation in STIR. Spatial resolution is enhanced resulting in a lower partial loss of intensity in sources of small size, e.g., the spill-over ratio for spherical sources of 1.8 mm diameter is 0.19 in the block and 0.34 in the cylindrical model. CONCLUSIONS:Results indicate a significant improvement for the new model in comparison with the old one which mapped the polygonal geometry into a cylinder. The new implementation was tested and is available for use via the library of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH)."

      "Ceramic-based nanocomposites are a rapidly evolving research area as they are currently being used in a wide range of applications. Epitaxial vertically aligned nanocomposites (VANs) offer promising advantages over conventional planar multilayers as key functionalities are tailored by the strong coupling at their vertical interfaces. However, limited knowledge exists of which material systems are compatible in composite films and which types of structures are optimal for a given functionality. No lithium-based VANs have yet been explored for energy storage, while 3D solid-state batteries offer great promise for enhanced energy and power densities. Although solid-on-solid kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (KMCS) models of VAN growth have previously been developed, phase separation was forced into the systems by limiting hopping directions and/or tuning the activation energies for hopping. Here, we study the influence of the temperature and deposition rate on the morphology evolution of lithium-based VANs, consisting of a promising LiMn2O4 cathode and a Li0.5La0.5TiO3 electrolyte, by applying a KMCS model with activation energies for hopping obtained experimentally and with minimum restrictions for hopping directions. Although the model considers only the kinetic processes away from thermodynamic equilibrium, which would determine the final shape of the pillars within the matrix, the trends in pillar size and distribution within the simulated VANs are in good agreement with experiments. This provides an elegant tool to predict the growth of VAN materials as the experimental activation energies and higher degrees of freedom for hopping result in a more realistic and low computational cost model to obtain accurate simulations of VAN materials."

      "The process of remove copper, nickel, cobalt and iron ions by natural zeolite of the Yagodninsky deposits, Kamchatka region, from water resources within a concentration range of 0.5-3.5 mg-eq/L has been experimentally investigated. The specified concentrations range was chosen according the contents of heavy metals in the waste water of the mining enterprise of Kamchatka region The values of maximum sorption capacity have been determined. On the basis of studies using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) it has been established by the Rietveld method of calculation that the zeolite tuff of the Yagodninsky deposit consists of clinoptilolite-Na (23.0 %), clinoptilolite-Ca (52.1 %) and modernite (12.9 %). It has been established that exchange cations are sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium. The Gibbs free energy has been calculated which is equal for copper ΔG = -25.6 kJ/mol, iron - ΔG = -23.7 kJ/mol, nickel - ΔG = -21.5 kJ/mol and cobalt - ΔG = -20.0 kJ/mol. The obtained results show that natural zeolite can be used as an effective sorbent for extracting of ions Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe2+ from polluted waters. On the basis of the analysis of the parameters of the mordenite crystal lattice a decrease in sizes in the direction of the a- and b-axes and, consequently, of the elementary cell volume of the treated zeolite is observed as compared with the initial zeolite in the Cu > Ni > Co > Fe row. New knowledge about the sorption properties of the Yagodninsky deposit zeolites can be interesting for the industrial areas of South-Eastern Asia such as China, Japan, Korea, etc."

      "Monosilicides of transition metals crystallizing in a B20 (FeSi-type) structure (space group P2 1 3, #198) possess a wide range of specific properties. Among them are semiconductors, metals, and paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and ferromagnetic compounds. Some of them were studied as promising thermoelectric materials. Recently, B20 monosilicides have attracted attention as a new class of topological semimetals with topological charge greater than unity. In the present work, we analyze the electronic structures of B20-type monosilicides of the fourth, fifth, and sixth periods of the Periodic Table in order to reveal their common features and peculiarities. To make this analysis more consistent, we performed a density-functional study of the electronic structures of the monosilicides in a unified manner. We reviewed the results of previous calculations and the available experimental data, comparing them with our results. The band structures of ReSi and TcSi not found in the literature were calculated and analyzed as well. The topological properties of these materials and of some isostructural germanides and stannides were investigated. Analysis reveals the current understanding of electronic structures and properties of this compound group."

      "The Dresselhaus and Rashba effects are well-known phenomena in solid-state physics, in which spin-orbit coupling splits spin-up and spin-down energy bands of nonmagnetic non-centrosymmetric crystals. Here, we discuss a phenomenon we dub band splitting with vanishing spin polarizations (BSVSP), in which, as usual, spin-orbit coupling splits the energy bands in nonmagnetic non-centrosymmetric systems. Surprisingly, however, both split bands show no net spin polarization along certain high-symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. In order to rationalize this phenomenon, we propose a classification of point groups into pseudo-polar and non-pseudo-polar groups. By means of first-principles simulations, we demonstrate that BSVSP can take place in both symmorphic (e.g., bulk GaAs) and non-symmorphic systems (e.g., two dimensional ferroelectric SnTe). Furthermore, we identify a linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space, which could be employed to tune the spin polarization with an external electric field. The BSVSP effect and its manipulation could therefore form the basis for future spintronic devices."

      "The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendously increased the demands for wind speed sensors in various applications, such as weather forecasting and environmental monitoring. To date, many wind speed sensors are developed based on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, the low output current leads to a poor sensing precision, which greatly limits their practical applications. Here, a wind speed sensor is proposed by integrating a wind-driven triboelectrification-induced electroluminescence (TIEL) component with a perovskite-based photodetector (PD) for enlarged electric current output. Compared with mechanoluminescence (ML), TIEL displays significantly higher signal intensity even under gentle breezes. In addition, the emission peak of TIEL matches with the absorption band of perovskite materials. Thus, TIEL materials are promising candidates for generating distinct electrical signals in real-time to facilitate the detection of wind speed. With a comparable detection limit (5 m s-1) to a conventional TENG-based wind speed sensor, the sensitivity of this hybrid sensor is three magnitudes higher at low bias voltages and, the response time is extremely short (<0.3 s). Moreover, it shows a favorable correlation with a commercial sensor. This research provides important progress toward environmentally-friendly light sources and TIEL-related sensor systems."

      "The high-silica zeolite SSZ-27 was synthesized using one of the isomers of the organic structure-directing agent that is known to produce the large-pore zeolite SSZ-26 (CON). The structure of the as-synthesized form was solved using multi-crystal electron diffraction data. Data were collected on eighteen crystals, and to obtain a high-quality and complete data set for structure refinement, hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to select the data sets most suitable for merging. The framework structure of SSZ-27 can be described as a combination of two types of cavities, one of which is shaped like a heart. The cavities are connected through shared 8-ring windows to create straight channels that are linked together in pairs to form a one-dimensional channel system. Once the framework structure was known, molecular modelling was used to find the best fitting isomer, and this, in turn, was isolated to improve the synthesis conditions for SSZ-27."

      "The development of white-light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs) makes it meaningful to develop novel high-performance phosphors excited by blue light. Herein, BiOCl:Pr3+ green-yellow phosphors were prepared via a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure, luminescent properties, lifetime, thermal quenching behavior, and quantum yield were studied in detail. The BiOCl:Pr3+ phosphors presented several emission peaks located in green and red regions, under excitation at 453 nm. The CIE coordinates could be tuned along with the changed doping concentration with fair luminescence efficiency. The results also indicated that the optimized doping concentration of Pr3+ ions was at x = 0.0075 because of the concentration quenching behavior resulting from an intense exchange effect. When the temperature reached 150 °C, the intensity of the emission peak at 495 nm could remain at 78% of that at room temperature. The activation energy of 0.20 eV also confirmed that the BiOCl:Pr3+ phosphor exhibited good thermal stability. All these results indicate that the prepared products have potential to be used as a high-performance green-yellow-light-emitting phosphor for blue-light-based w-LEDs."

      "Research on materials with perovskite crystal symmetry for photonics applications represent a rapidly growing area of the photonics development due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Among them are high charge carrier mobility, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and high extinction coefficients, which can be tuned through all visible range by a controllable change in chemical composition. To date, most of such materials contain lead atoms, which is one of the obstacles for their large-scale implementation. This disadvantage can be overcome via the substitution of lead with less toxic chemical elements, such as Sn, Bi, Yb, etc., and their mixtures. Herein, we summarized the scientific works from 2016 related to the lead-free perovskite materials with stress on the lasing and lighting applications. The synthetic approaches, chemical composition, and morphology of materials, together with the optimal device configurations depending on the material parameters are summarized with a focus on future challenges."

      "An extensive characterization of Co3 (PO4 )2 was performed by topological analysis according to Bader's Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules from the experimentally and theoretically determined electron density. This study sheds light on the reactivity of cobalt orthophosphate as a solid-state heterogeneous oxidative-dehydration and -dehydrogenation catalyst. Various faces of the bulk catalyst were identified as possible reactive sites given their topological properties. The charge accumulations and depletions around the two independent five- and sixfold-coordinated cobalt atoms, found in the topological analysis, are correlated to the orientation and population of the d-orbitals. It is shown that the (011) face has the best structural features for catalysis. Fivefold-coordinated ions in close proximity to advantageously oriented vacant coordination sites and electron depletions suit the oxygen lone pairs of the reactant, mainly for chemisorption. This is confirmed both from the multipole refinement as well as from density functional theory calculations. Nearby basic phosphate ions are readily available for C-H activation."

      "Nonlinear beam shaping refers to spatial reconfiguration of a light beam at a new frequency, which can be achieved by using nonlinear photonic crystals (NPCs). Direct nonlinear beam shaping has been achieved to convert second-harmonic waves into focusing spots, vortex beams, and diffraction-free beams. However, previous nonlinear beam shaping configurations in one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) NPCs generally suffer from low efficiency because of unfulfilled phase-matching condition. Here, we present efficient generations of second-harmonic vortex and Hermite-Gaussian beams in the recently-developed three-dimensional (3D) lithium niobate NPCs fabricated by using a femtosecond-laser-engineering technique. Since 3D χ(2) modulations can be designed to simultaneously fulfill the requirements of nonlinear wave-front shaping and quasi-phase-matching, the conversion efficiency is enhanced up to two orders of magnitude in a tens-of-microns-long 3D NPC in comparison to the 2D case. Efficient nonlinear beam shaping paves a way for its applications in optical communication, super-resolution imaging, high-dimensional entangled source, etc."

      "Non-destructive orientation mapping is an important characterization tool in materials science and geoscience for understanding and/or improving material properties based on their grain structure. Confocal Raman microscopy is a powerful non-destructive technique for chemical mapping of organic and inorganic materials. Here we demonstrate orientation mapping by means of Polarized Raman Microscopy (PRM). While the concept that PRM is sensitive to orientation changes is known, to our knowledge, an actual quantitative orientation mapping has never been presented before. Using a concept of ambiguity-free orientation determination analysis, we present fast and quantitative single-acquisition Raman-based orientation mapping by simultaneous registration of multiple Raman scattering spectra obtained at different polarizations. We demonstrate applications of this approach for two- and three-dimensional orientation mapping of a multigrain semiconductor, a pharmaceutical tablet formulation and a polycrystalline sapphire sample. This technique can potentially move traditional X-ray and electron diffraction type experiments into conventional optical laboratories."

      "The adhesion of the scale formed on Nb-silicide based alloys at 1473 K improves when Al and Sn are in synergy with Si and Ti. This improvement is observed when there is segregation of Sn in the microstructure below the alloy/scale interface and a layer rich in intermetallics that include TM5Sn2X compounds is formed at the interface. Data for the ternary compounds is scarce. In this paper elastic and thermodynamic properties of the Nb5Sn2Al, Ti5Sn2Si, Ti5Sn2Al and Nb5Sn2Si compounds were studied using the first-principles, pseudopotential plane-wave method based on density functional theory. The enthalpy of formation of the ternary intermetallics was calculated using the quasi-harmonic approximation. The calculations suggest that the Nb5Sn2Si is the stiffest; that the Nb5Sn2Al and Ti5Sn2Si are the most and less ductile phases respectively; and that Nb significantly increases the bulk, shear and elastic moduli of the ternary compound compared with Ti."

      "Bis(acetylacetonato)copper(II) can be synthesized economically and with ease by the reaction between acetylacetone and a copper salt (Cu(OAc)2 or CuCl2·2H2O). When used as catalyst, bis(acetylacetonato)copper(II) is sometimes being oxidized to Cu(III) or reduced to Cu(I), although only the structure of the neutral form is known experimentally. The content of this paper provides computational chemistry calculated data of the geometry, electronic structure, spin state and frontier orbitals for the neutral, as well as the oxidized and reduced forms of the bis(acetylacetonato)copper(II) molecule. This data shows that both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the neutral molecule are copper based. The neutral molecule is a spin = ½ system. The data shows that the spin state of both the oxidized and reduced molecules is zero."

      "The crystal structure of 1-(pyren-1-yl)but-2-yn-1-one ( 1 a , a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon displaying enhanced luminescence in the solid state, has been re-determined at several pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 3 GPa using a Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC). These experiments were augmented by periodic DFT calculations at pressures up to 4.4 GPa. UV-Vis fluorescence of 1 a at non-ambient pressures has also been investigated. The crystal structure consists of infinite π -stacks of anti-parallel 1 a molecules with discernible dimers, which may exemplify aggregates formed by pyrene derivatives in solution and thin films, and is predominantly stabilized by dispersion. The average inter-planar distance between individual molecules within π -stacks decreases with pressure in the investigated range. This results in piezochromic properties of 1 a : a red-shift of sample color, as well as a bathochromic shift of fluorescence with pressure (by ca. 100 nm at 3.5 GPa). Two-component fluorescence spectra support the hypothesis that at least two types of excimers are involved in the electronic excitation processes in crystalline 1 a ."

      "First-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to study the atomic structure and electronic structure of LiAl2(OH)6Cl, the only material in the layered double hydroxide family in which delithiation was found to occur. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were used to explore the evolution of the structure of LiAl2(OH)6Cl during a thermally induced delithiation process. The simulations show that this process occurs due to the drastic dynamics of Li+ at temperatures higher than ~450 K, in which the [Al2(OH)6] host layers remain stable up to 1100 K. The calculated large value of the Li+ diffusion coefficient D, ~ 3.13 × 10 - 5 c m 2 / s , at 500 K and the high stability of the [Al2(OH)6] framework suggest a potential technical application of the partially-delithiated Li1-xAl2(OH)6Cl1-x (0 < x < 1) as a superionic conductor at high temperatures."

      "Mass transport driven by temperature gradient is commonly seen in fluids. However, here we demonstrate that when drawing a cold nano-tip off a hot solid substrate, thermomigration can be so rampant that it can be exploited for producing single-crystalline aluminum, copper, silver and tin nanowires. This demonstrates that in nanoscale objects, solids can mimic liquids in rapid morphological changes, by virtue of fast surface diffusion across short distances. During uniform growth, a thin neck-shaped ligament containing a grain boundary (GB) usually forms between the hot and the cold ends, sustaining an extremely high temperature gradient that should have driven even larger mass flux, if not counteracted by the relative sluggishness of plating into the GB and the resulting back stress. This GB-containing ligament is quite robust and can adapt to varying drawing directions and velocities, imparting good controllability to the nanowire growth in a manner akin to Czochralski crystal growth."

      "The magnetic ground states in highly ordered double perovskites LaSr1-xCaxNiReO6 (x = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0) are studied in view of the Goodenough-Kanamori rules of superexchange interactions in this paper. In LaSrNiReO6, Ni and Re sublattices are found to exhibit curious magnetic states separately, but no long range magnetic ordering is achieved. The magnetic transition at ~255 K is identified with the independent Re sublattice magnetic ordering. Interestingly, the sublattice interactions are tuned by modifying the Ni-O-Re bond angles through Ca doping. Upon Ca doping, the Ni and Re sublattices start to display a ferrimagnetically ordered state at low temperature. The neutron powder diffraction data reveals long range ferrimagnetic ordering of the Ni and Re magnetic sublattices along the crystallographic b-axis. The transition temperature of the ferrimagnetic phase increases monotonically with increasing Ca concentration."

      "Understanding the reaction initiation of energetic single crystals under external stimuli is a long-term challenge in the field of high energy density materials. Herewith, we developed an ab initio molecular dynamics method based on the multiscale shock technique (MSST) and reported the reaction initiation mechanism by performing large-scale simulations for the sensitive explosive benzotrifuroxan (BTF), insensitive explosive triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), four polymorphs of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) pristine crystals and five novel CL-20 cocrystals. A theoretical indicator, tinitiation, the delay of decomposition reaction under shock, was proposed to characterize the shock sensitivity of energetic single crystal, which was proved to be reliable and satisfactorily consistent with experiments. We found that it was the coupling of heat and pressure that drove the shock reaction, wherein the vibrational spectra, the specific heat capacity, as well as the strength of the trigger bonds were the determinants of the shock sensitivity. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds were found to effectively buffer the system from heating, thereby delaying the decomposition reaction and reducing the shock sensitivity of the energetic single crystal. Theoretical rules for synthesizing novel energetic materials with low shock sensitivity were given. Our work is expected to provide a useful reference for the understanding, certifying and adjusting of the shock sensitivity of novel energetic materials."

      "The development of useful structure-function relationships for materials that exhibit correlated nanoscale disorder requires adequately large atomistic models which today are obtained mainly via theoretical simulations. Here, we exploit our recent advances in structure-refinement methodology to demonstrate how such models can be derived directly from simultaneous fitting of 3D diffuse- and total-scattering data, and we use this approach to elucidate the complex nanoscale atomic correlations in the classical relaxor ferroelectric PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN). Our results uncover details of ordering of Mg and Nb and reveal a hierarchical structure of polar nanoregions associated with the Pb and Nb displacements. The magnitudes of these displacements and their alignment vary smoothly across the nanoregion boundaries. No spatial correlations were found between the chemical ordering and the polar nanoregions. This work highlights a broadly applicable nanoscale structure-refinement method and provides insights into the structure of PMN that require rethinking its existing contentious models."

      "In order to study the crystallinity of different density polyethylenes, this paper conducts an experimental study on the transformation of the conductance mechanism under a high electric field. In this experiment, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differentials scanning calorimetry (DSC), direct current (DC) breakdown of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), as well as the conductivity characteristics under an electric field of 5-200 kV/mm are tested. In addition, the electric field-current density curves of the four kinds of polyethylene are fitted to analyze their conductance transition in non-ohmic regions under different high field strengths, through applying the mathematical formula of a variety of conductance mechanisms. The experimental results are as follows: as the density of polyethylene increases, the crystallinity increases continuously. Moreover, the continuous increase of crystallinity causes the electric conduction flow under the same field strength to decrease significantly. The field strength corresponding to the two turning points in the conductance characteristic curve increases simultaneously, and the breakdown field strength increases accordingly; through analysis, it is found that in the high field, as the electric field increases, the conductance mechanism develops from the ohmic conductance of the low field strength region to the bulk effect of the high field strength region (Poole-Frenkel effect). Then, it develops into the electrode effect to the high field strength (Schottky effect), although the threshold field strength of this conductance mechanism transition increases with the increase of crystallinity."

      "Ta5+-doped Bi2O3 solid solutions, (Bi1-x Ta x )2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20), were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure, optical properties, and color of the pigments were characterized. The (Bi1-x Ta x )2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.20) samples were obtained in a single-phase form, and the crystal structure depended on the Ta content; they were monoclinic α-phase (x = 0), tetragonal β-phase (x = 0.03, 0.04), and cubic δ-phase (x = 0.20). Among them, (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 strongly absorbed visible light at the wavelength shorter than 480 nm and exhibited the most vivid orange color. The redness value (a*) was comparable to that of commercial orange pigments, and the yellowness value (b*) was slightly larger. Although it is necessary to improve chemical stability, the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment has potential for an environmentally friendly inorganic orange pigment."

      "We have examined the effects of temperature, stress, and grain size on the creep process including creep strain, crystal structure, dislocations and diffusions of nanocrystalline NiAl alloy through molecular dynamics simulations. A smaller grain size accelerates the creep process due to the large volume fraction of grain boundaries. Higher temperatures and stress levels also speed up this process in terms of dislocation changes and atom diffusion. In both primary creep and steady-state creep stages, atomic diffusion at the grain boundary could be seen and the dislocation density increased gradually, indicating that the creep mechanism at these stages is Coble creep controlled by grain boundary diffusion while accompanied by dislocation nucleation. When the model enters the tertiary creep stage, it can be observed that the diffusion of atoms in the grain boundary and in the crystal and the dislocation density gradually decreases, implying that the creep mechanisms at this stage are Coble creep, controlled by grain boundary diffusion, and Nabarro-Herring creep, controlled by lattice diffusion."

      "The luminescence properties of Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+ and Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ phosphors are presented. After being excited by a light source, Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ phosphors emit intense yellow long persistent luminescence covering the region from 450 to 700 nm, which can last about 8 h. Thermoluminescence curves were demonstrated to analyze the trapping nature of persistent luminescence. Tm3+ is added to improve the long persistent luminescence properties of phosphors. The mechanism of persistent luminescence has been studied."

      "The study of organic molecular crystals under high pressure provides fundamental insight into crystal packing distortions and reveals mechanisms of phase transitions and the crystallization of polymorphs. These solid-state transformations can be monitored directly by analyzing electron charge densities that are experimentally obtained at high pressure. However, restricting the analysis to the featureless electron density does not reveal the chemical bonding nature and the existence of intermolecular interactions. This shortcoming can be resolved by the use of the DORI (density overlap region indicator) descriptor, which is capable of simultaneously detecting both covalent patterns and noncovalent interactions from electron density and its derivatives. Using the biscarbonyl[14]annulene crystal under pressure as an example, we demonstrate how DORI can be exploited on experimental electron densities to reveal and monitor changes in electronic structure patterns resulting from molecular compression. A novel approach based on a flood-fill-type algorithm is proposed for analyzing the topology of the DORI isosurface. This approach avoids the arbitrary selection of DORI isovalues and provides an intuitive way to assess how compression packing affects covalent bonding in organic solids."

      "We have designed and prepared a novel cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based on SrCo0.95Ru0.05O3-δ perovskite. We have partially replaced Sr by Ba in Sr0.9Ba0.1Co0.95Ru0.05O3-δ (SBCRO) in order to expand the unit-cell size, thereby improving the ionic diffusion of O2- through the crystal lattice. The characterization of this new oxide has been studied at room temperature by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments. At room temperature, SBCRO perovskite crystallizes in the P4/mmm tetragonal space group, as observed from NDP data. The maximum conductivity value of 18.6 S cm-1 is observed at 850 °C. Polarization resistance measurements on LSGM electrolyte demonstrate an improvement in conductivity with respect to the parent Sr-only perovskite cathode. A good chemical compatibility and an adequate thermal expansion coefficient make this oxide auspicious for using it as a cathode in SOFC."

      "Size and surface properties such as catalysis, optical quantum dot photoluminescense, and surface plasmon resonances depend on the coordination and chemistry of metal and semiconducting nanoclusters. Such coordination-dependent properties are quantified herein via \"magic formulas\" for the number of shells, n, in the cluster. We investigate face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, simple cubic clusters, hexagonal close-packed clusters, and the diamond cubic structure as a function of the number of cluster shells, n. In addition, we examine the Platonic solids in the form of multi-shell clusters, for a total of 19 cluster types. The number of bonds and atoms and coordination numbers exhibit magic number characteristics versus n, as the size of the clusters increases. Starting with only the spatial coordinates, we create an adjacency and distance matrix that facilitates the calculation of topological indices, including the Wiener, hyper-Wiener, reverse Wiener, and Szeged indices. Some known topological formulas for some Platonic solids when n=1 are computationally verified. These indices have magic formulas for many of the clusters. The simple cubic structure is the least complex of our clusters as measured by the topological complexity derived from the information content of the vertex-degree distribution. The dispersion, or relative percentage of surface atoms, is measured quantitatively with respect to size and shape dependence for some types of clusters with catalytic applications."

      "High refractive index nanoparticle material was applied as a scattering layer on the inner side of a glass substrate of a bottom emission organic light emitting diode (OLED) device to enhance light extraction and to improve angular color shift. TiO2 and YSZ (Yttria Stabilized Zirconia; Y2O3-ZrO2) were examined as the high refractive index nanoparticles. The nanoparticle material was formed as a scattering layer on a glass substrate by a coating method, which is generally used in the commercial display manufacturing process. Additionally, a planarization layer was coated on the scattering layer with the same method. The implemented nanoparticle material and planarization material endured, without deformation, the subsequent thermal annealing process, which was carried out at temperature ranged to 580 °C. We demonstrated a practical and highly efficient OLED device using the conventional display manufacturing process by implementing the YSZ nanoparticle. We obtained a 38% enhanced luminance of the OLED device and a decreased angular color change compared to a conventional OLED device."

      "The work is dedicated to the study of the structural and optical characteristics, as well as the phase transformations, of ferrite nanoparticles of CeO2-Fe2O3. To characterize the results obtained, the methods of scanning and transmission microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, and Mössbauer spectroscopy were applied. It was found that the initial nanoparticles are polycrystalline structures based on cerium oxide with the presence of X-ray amorphous inclusions in the structure, which are characteristic of iron oxide. The study determined the dynamics of phase and structural transformations, as well as the appearance of a magnetic texture depending on the annealing temperature. According to the Mossbauer spectroscopy data, it has been established that a rise in the annealing temperature gives rise to an ordering of the magnetic properties and a decrease in the concentration of cationic and vacancy defects in the structure. During the life test of synthesized nanoparticles as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, the dependences of the cathode lifetime on the phase composition of nanoparticles were established. It is established that the appearance of a magnetic component in the structure result in a growth in the resource lifetime and the number of operating cycles. The results show the prospects of using these nanoparticles as the basis for lithium-ion batteries, and the simplicity of synthesis and the ability to control phase transformations opens up the possibility of scalable production of these nanoparticles for cathode materials."

      "There are several key requirements that a very good LED phosphor should meet, i.e., strong absorption, high quantum efficiency, high colour purity, and high luminescence quenching temperature. The reported Rb2Bi(PO4)(MoO4):Eu3+ phosphors have all these properties. The Rb2Bi(PO4)(MoO4):Eu3+ phosphors emit bright red light if excited with near-UV radiation. The calculated colour coordinates show good stability in the 77-500 K temperature range. Moreover, sample doped with 50% Eu3+ possesses quantum efficiency close to unity. Besides the powder samples, ceramic disks of Rb2Eu(PO4)(MoO4) specimen were also prepared, and the red light sources from these disks in combination with near-UV emitting LED were fabricated. The obtained results indicated that ceramic disks efficiently absorb the emission of 375 and 400 nm LED and could be applied as a red component in phosphor-converted white LEDs."

      "Attaining the durability of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) operated under concomitant light and thermal stresses is still a serious concern before large-scale application. It is crucial to maintain the phase stability of the organic hole-transporting layer for thermostable PSCs across a range of temperatures sampled during device operation. To address this issue, we propose a racemic semiconducting glassy film with remarkable morphological stability, exemplified here by a low-molecular symmetry oxa[5]helicene-centered organic semiconductor (O5H-OMeDPA). The helical configuration of O5H-OMeDPA confers the trait of multiple-dimension charge transfer to the solid, resulting in high hole mobility of 6.7 × 10-4 cm2 V-1 s-1 of a solution-processed glassy film. O5H-OMeDPA is combined with a triple-cation dual-halide lead perovskite to fabricate PSCs with power conversion efficiencies of 21.03%, outperforming the control cells with spiro-OMeTAD (20.44%). Moreover, the cells using O5H-OMeDPA exhibit good long-term stability during full-sunlight soaking at 60°C."

      "The electrochemical generation of hydrogen is a key enabling technology for the production of sustainable fuels. Transition metal chalcogenides show considerable promise as catalysts for this reaction, but to date there are very few reports of tellurides in this context, and none of these transition metal telluride catalysts are especially active. Here, we show that the catalytic performance of metallic 1T'-MoTe2 is improved dramatically when the electrode is held at cathodic bias. As a result, the overpotential required to maintain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 decreases from 320 mV to just 178 mV. We show that this rapid and reversible activation process has its origins in adsorption of H onto Te sites on the surface of 1T'-MoTe2. This activation process highlights the importance of subtle changes in the electronic structure of an electrode material and how these can influence the subsequent electrocatalytic activity that is displayed."

      "Tin oxide quantum dots were synthesized in aqueous solution via a simple hydrolysis and oxidation process. The morphology observation showed that the quantum dots had an average grain size of 2.23 nm. The rutile phase SnO2 was confirmed by the structural and compositional characterization. The fluorescence spectroscopy of quantum dots was used to detect the heavy metal ions of Cd2+, Fe3+, Ni2+ and Pb2+, which caused the quenching effect of photoluminescence. The quantum dots showed the response of 2.48 to 100 ppm Ni2+. The prepared SnO2 quantum dots exhibited prospective in the detection of heavy metal ions in contaminated water, including deionized water, deionized water with Fe3+, reclaimed water and sea water. The limit of detection was as low as 0.01 ppm for Ni2+ detection. The first principle calculation based on the density function theory demonstrated the dependence of fluorescence response on the adsorption energy of heavy metal ions as well as ion radius. The mechanism of fluorescence response was discussed based on the interaction between Sn vacancies and Ni2+ ions. A linear correlation of fluorescence emission intensity against Ni2+ concentration was obtained in the logarithmic coordinates. The density of active Sn vacancies was the crucial factor that determined fluorescence response of SnO2 QDs to heavy metal ions."

      "A successive approach to the solution of the inverse problem of the X-ray diffraction tomography (XRDT) is proposed. It is based on the semi-kinematical solution of the dynamical Takagi-Taupin equations for the σ-polarized diffracted wave amplitude. Theoretically, the case of the Coulomb-type point defect in a single crystal Si(111) under the exact conditions of the symmetric Laue diffraction for a set of the tilted X-ray topography 2D-images (2D projections) is considered provided that the plane-parallel sample is rotated around the diffraction vector [[Formula: see text]20]. The iterative simulated annealing (SA) and quasi-Newton gradient descent (qNGD) algorithm codes are used for a recovery of the 3D displacement-field function of the Coulomb-type point defect. The computer recovery data of the 3D displacement-field function related to the one XRDT 2D projection are presented. It is proved that the semi-kinematical approach to the solution of the dynamical Takagi-Taupin equations is effective for recovering the 3D displacement-field function even for the one XRDT 2D projection."

      "Magnetism, when combined with an unconventional electronic band structure, can give rise to forefront electronic properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, axion electrodynamics, and Majorana fermions. Here we report the characterization of high-quality crystals of EuSn2P2, a new quantum material specifically designed to engender unconventional electronic states plus magnetism. EuSn2P2 has a layered, Bi2Te3-type structure. Ferromagnetic interactions dominate the Curie-Weiss susceptibility, but a transition to antiferromagnetic ordering occurs near 30 K. Neutron diffraction reveals that this is due to two-dimensional ferromagnetic spin alignment within individual Eu layers and antiferromagnetic alignment between layers-this magnetic state surrounds the Sn-P layers at low temperatures. The bulk electrical resistivity is sensitive to the magnetism. Electronic structure calculations reveal that EuSn2P2 might be a strong topological insulator, which can be a new magnetic topological quantum material (MTQM) candidate. The calculations show that surface states should be present, and they are indeed observed by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements."

      "Coexistence of reversible polar distortions and metallicity leading to a ferroelectric metal, first suggested by Anderson and Blount in 1965, has so far remained elusive. Electrically switchable intrinsic electric polarization, together with the direct observation of ferroelectric domains, has not yet been realized in a bulk crystalline metal, although incomplete screening by mobile conduction charges should, in principle, be possible. Here, we provide evidence that native metallicity and ferroelectricity coexist in bulk crystalline van der Waals WTe2 by means of electrical transport, nanoscale piezoresponse measurements, and first-principles calculations. We show that, despite being a Weyl semimetal, WTe2 has switchable spontaneous polarization and a natural ferroelectric domain structure at room temperature. This new class of materials has tantalizing potential for functional nanoelectronics applications."

      "We theoretically investigate the mechanism of ferroelectric switching via interlayer shear in 3R MoS2 using first principles and lattice dynamics calculations. First principle calculations show the prominent anharmonic coupling of the infrared inactive interlayer shear and the infrared active phonons. The nonlinear coupling terms generates an effective anharmonic force which drives the interlayer shear mode and lowers the ferroelectric switching barrier depending on the amplitude and polarization of infrared mode. Lattice dynamics simulations show that the interlayer shear mode can be coherently excited to the switching threshold by a train of infrared pulses polarized along the zigzag axis of MoS2. The results of this study indicate the possibility of ultrafast ferroelectricity in stacked two-dimensional materials from the control of stacking sequence."

      "The benefit of computational methods applying density functional theory for the description and understanding of modulated crystal structures is investigated. A method is presented which allows one to establish, improve and test superspace models including displacive and occupational modulation functions from first-principles calculations on commensurate structures. The total energies of different configurations allow one to distinguish stable and less stable structure models. The study is based on a series of geometrically optimized superstructures of mullite (Al4+2xSi2-2xO10-x) derived from the superspace group Pbam(α0½)0ss. Despite the disordered and structurally complex nature of mullite, the calculations on ordered superstructures are very useful for determining the ideal Al/Si ordering in mullite, extracting atomic modulation functions as well as understanding the SiO2-Al2O3 phase diagram. The results are compared with experimentally established models which confirm the validity and utility of the presented method."

      "Transient pressure testing is often accompanied by shock acceleration. Aiming at the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors, a dynamic compensation method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with system identification theory (SIT) is proposed in this paper. This method is more effective at reducing the error of the acceleration-induced effects without affecting the sensor's sensitivity and inherent frequency. The principle and theoretical basis of acceleration-induced effects is analyzed, and the static and dynamic acceleration-induced effects on the quartz crystal of a piezoelectric pressure sensor are performed. An acceleration-induced effects dynamic calibration system is built using a Machete hammer, which generates acceleration signals with larger amplitude and narrower pulse width, and an autoregressive exogenous (ARX)mathematical model of acceleration-induced effects is obtained using empirical mode decomposition-system identification theory (EMD-SIT). A digital compensation filter for acceleration-induced effects is designed on the basis of this model. Experimental results explain that the acceleration-induced effects of the pressure sensor were less than 11% after using the digital compensation filter. A series of test data verify the accuracy, reliability, and generality of the model."

      "The hybrid nature and soft lattice of organolead halide perovskites render their structural changes and optical properties susceptible to external driving forces such as temperature and pressure, remarkably different from conventional semiconductors. Here, we investigate the pressure-induced optical response of a typical two-dimensional perovskite crystal, phenylethylamine lead iodide. At a moderate pressure within 3.5 GPa, its photoluminescence red-shifts continuously, exhibiting an ultrabroad energy tunability range up to 320 meV in the visible spectrum, with quantum yield remaining nearly constant. First-principles calculations suggest that an out-of-plane quasi-uniaxial compression occurs under a hydrostatic pressure, while the energy is absorbed by the reversible and elastic tilting of the benzene rings within the long-chain ligands. This anisotropic structural deformation effectively modulates the quantum confinement effect by 250 meV via barrier height lowering. The broad tunability within a relatively low pressure range will expand optoelectronic applications to a new paradigm with pressure as a tuning knob."

      "The all solid-state terahertz (THz) radar has obvious miniaturized integration and high resolution imaging advantages compared with conventional microwave radar. In this paper, a 0.22 THz active frequency-modulated pulse radar system with one transmission channel and four receiving channels is presented, and interferometric inverse synthetic aperture radar (InISAR) imaging experiments, which can acquire altitude information of objects, are carried out. In order to acquire high-quality InISAR images, a calibration method is presented to solve the nonlinearity of wideband signal frequency and phase inconsistency of different receiving channels together. Furthermore, to deal with the phase wrapping in InISAR imaging of objects with large scale, a novel method based on the dominant scatterers to estimate the objects rotation rate is presented. Finally, to show more information of objects in the InISAR images, the imaging results with a large rotation angle by the convolutional back-projection algorithm are obtained. The imaging results verify the superior performance of the multi-channel THz radar system and the imaging processing method, which can provide support for further research on InISAR imaging in the THz band."

      "The practical implementation of supercapacitors is hindered by low utilization and poor structural stability of electrode materials. Herein, to surmount these critical challenges, a three-dimensional hierarchical α-Co(OH)2/α-Ni(OH)2 heterojunction nanorods are built in situ on Ni foam through a mild two-step growth reaction. The unique lamellar crystal structure and abundant intercalated anions of α-M(OH)2 (M = Co or Ni) and the ideal electronic conductivity of α-Co(OH)2 construct numerous cross-linked ion and electron transport paths in heterojunction nanorods. The deformation stresses exerted by α-Co(OH)2 and α-Ni(OH)2 on each other guarantee the excellent structural stability of this heterojunction nanorods. Using nickel foam with a three-dimensional network conductive framework as the template ensures the rapidly transfer of electrons between this heterojunction nanorods and current collector. Three-dimensional hierarchical structure of α-Co(OH)2/α-Ni(OH)2 heterojunction nanorods provides a large liquid interface area. These result together in the high utilization rate and excellent structure stability of the α-Co(OH)2/α-Ni(OH)2 heterojunction nanorods. And the capacitance retention rate is up to 93.4% at 1 A g-1 from three-electrode system to two-electrode system. The α-Co(OH)2/α-Ni(OH)2//AC device also present a long cycle life (the capacitance retention rate is 123.6% at 5 A g-1 for 10000 cycles), a high specific capacitance (207.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), and high energy density and power density (72.6 Wh kg-1 at 196.4 W kg-1 and 40.9 Wh kg-1 at 3491.8 W kg-1), exhibiting a fascinating potential for supercapacitor in large-scale applications."

      "This data article reports crystal-chemical and structural data (unit cell parameters and internal coordinates) of two hydroxyl minerals, namely brucite [magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2] and portlandite [calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2], which were calculated and employed to derive the mechanical behavior of these solid phases under hydrostatic compression (Ulian and Valdrè, 2018). The dataset has been obtained by ab initio quantum mechanical means, by employing Density Functional Theory methods, in particular the B3LYP hybrid functional, all-electron Gaussian-type orbitals basis sets and a correction to take into account the effects of dispersive forces. Equilibrium and expanded/compressed models of both minerals were realized and geometrically optimized within two space group settings, P3¯m1 and P3¯ ."

      "The neutron powder diffractometer POWGEN at the Spallation Neutron Source has recently (2017-2018) undergone an upgrade which resulted in an increased detector complement along with a full overhaul of the structural design of the instrument. The current instrument has a solid angular coverage of 1.2 steradians and maintains the original third-generation concept, providing a single-histogram data set over a wide d-spacing range and high resolution to access large unit cells, detailed structural refinements and in situ/operando measurements."

      "Quantum bits (qubits) constitute the most elementary building-blocks of any quantum technology, where information is stored and processed in the form of quantum superpositions between discrete energy levels. In particular, the fabrication of quantum processors is a key long-term goal that will allow us conducting specific tasks much more efficiently than the most powerful classical computers can do. Motivated by recent experiments in which three addressable spin qubits are defined on a potential single-molecule quantum processor, namely the [Gd(H2O)P5W30O110]12- polyoxometalate, we investigate the decohering effect of magnetic noise on the encoded quantum information. Our state-of-the-art model, which provides more accurate results than previous estimates, show a noticeable contribution of magnetic noise in limiting the survival timescale of the qubits. Yet, our results suggest that it might not be the only dephasing mechanism at play but other mechanisms, such as lattice vibrations and physical movement of magnetic nuclei, must be considered to understand the whole decoherence process."

      "Charge transport in organic thin films which are generally polycrystalline is typically limited by the localization of the carriers at lattice defects resulting in low carrier mobilities and carriers move from one state to another state by hopping. However, charge transport in organic semiconductors in their single crystalline phase is coherent due to band conduction and mobilities are not limited by disorder resulting in higher carrier mobility. So it is a challenge to enhance the carrier mobility in a thin film which is the preferred choice for all organic devices. Here, we show that it is possible to increase the carrier mobility in polycrystalline thin films by injecting sufficient carriers such that Fermi level can be moved into the region of high density in Gaussian density of states of molecular solids. When the hopping transport happens through the molecular energy levels whose density is low, mobility is decided by incoherent transport however, when the the hopping transport happens through the energy levels with high density, mobility is decided by coherent transport, as in band conduction. We present results highlighting the observation of both band-like and hopping conduction in polycrystalline organic thin films by varying the concentration of injected charge. More importantly the transition from hopping to band transport is reversible. The observed carrier mobilities in both the regimes match well with theoretical estimates of hopping mobility and band mobility determined from first principles density functional theory."

      "Layered CaTaN2 and MgTa2N3 and cubic Mg2Ta2N4 were prepared by direct solid state reaction from the binary nitrides Ta3N5 and A3N2 (A: Mg, Ca). CaTaN2 showed a slight Ca deficiency (0.11 moles per formula), and a monoclinic distortion from previously reported R3̅m symmetry, with space group C2/m and cell parameters a = 5.4011(2), b = 3.1434(1), c = 5.9464(2) Å and β = 107.91(3)°. Ca2+ and Mg2+ deintercalation was investigated in the three compounds both chemically and electrochemically. No significant Mg2+ extraction could be inferred for MgTa2N3 and Mg2Ta2N4, neither after reaction with NO2BF4 nor after electrochemical oxidation at 100 °C in alkyl carbonate electrolytes. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of chemically oxidized Ca0.89TaN2 indicates a decrease of the Ca content to 0.34 concomitant to the disappearance of the monoclinic distortion and expansion of the interlayer space from 5.658 to 5.762 Å, space group R3̅m and cell parameters a = 3.1103(1) and c = 17.287(1) Å. Deintercalation in this compound was also achieved electrochemically at 100 °C. Results of density functional theory calculations seem to indicate that reaction mechanisms for CaTaN2 oxidation additional and/or alternative to deintercalation are taking place, which is likely related to the loss of crystallinity observed upon oxidation and the irreversibility of the process."

      "The ideal product of rare-earth-doped phosphors should have uniform particle size distribution and homogeneous doping ions in each particle, and therefore, intensified micromixing at mesoscale is highly required. In this article, inspired by the concept of \"mesoscience\", we demonstrate the tuning of Eu3+ doping in GdBO3 microparticles at mesoscale by a high-gravity-assisted reactive precipitation-coupled calcination process. The high-gravity environment and tiny droplets generated by the high-gravity rotating packed bed (RPB) reactor lead to significant intensification of mass transfer and micromixing, which are beneficial for the homogeneous doping of Eu3+ in the host material during reactive precipitation in liquid solution. Under excitation at 395 nm, the emission spectra of the Eu3+-doped phosphors exhibit a narrow-band red emission centered at 625 nm and the highest intensity was observed at x = 0.2. The RPB products show higher intensity than that of the control group even when the reaction time was shortened to 1/6. After calculation, the quenching in the sample most likely results from dipole-dipole interactions. The chromaticity coordinates for the RPB sample was measured as (0.598, 0.341) with a quantum yield of up to 78.11%, and the phosphors exhibit good thermal stability at 423 K. The phosphors were used as the luminescent materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and the devices showed good performance. Our preliminary study illustrated that high-gravity-assisted approaches are promising for tuning the doping of rare-earth ions in microparticles at mesoscale toward efficient production of phosphors for LEDs."

      "The multiring disk resonator gyroscope (DRG) has been a candidate for high performance gyroscopes, however nowadays the finite element method (FEM) is the main method for its analysis due to its complex structure. In this paper we propose a new method to mathematically model the DRG for its vibrating modes and lumped parameters based on the component mode synthesis (CMS) method. Firstly, the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of the DRG are mathematically modeled and a comparison with the FEM results is conducted. It shows that the mode shapes of DRG obtained by FEM and mathematical modeling are identical and in the full ranges of geometrical parameters, natural frequency error of the simulation, and calculation results are limited in ±15%. It demonstrates the effectivity and feasibility of the mathematical modeling method. Then, based on the calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes, the lumped mass-spring model of the DRG and effects of geometry parameters on the lumped mass-spring parameters are investigated, which can be used on the design of the DRG. This mathematical modeling method can effectively improve the analyzing efficiency of the DRG and the method can also be used on the analysis of other complex multiring-type resonators."

      "Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a formula of (A')2(A) n -1B n X3 n +1 have recently gained widespread interest as candidates for the next generation of optoelectronic devices. The variations of organic cation, metal halide, and the number of layers in the structure lead to the change of crystal structures and properties for different optoelectronic applications. Herein, the different synthetic methods for 2D perovskite crystals and thin films are summarized and compared. The optoelectronic properties and the charge transfer process in the devices are also delved, in particular, for light-emitting diodes and solar cells."

      "Herein, emerging applications of luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals are addressed, such as quantum dots and quantum rods as down-conversion materials used in liquid crystal displays (LCD). Their precisely tunable emission wavelengths and narrow emission bandwidths offer high color purity resulting in a wide color gamut with vivid colors for LCDs. Anisotropic materials, such as quantum rods, have the additional advantage of polarized emission, which can bring a significant improvement to the efficiency of LCD displays. The basic optical properties of these nanomaterials are considered, with a focus on quantum rods, and the challenges and progress in their assembly are discussed. Different techniques for quantum rod alignment are introduced such as shear-oriented, electric field and magnetic field assisted assembly, mechanical rubbing, stretching, and electrospinning. The photoalignment approach allows for an easy arrangement of quantum rods in-plane, and the implications of this method to patterning are considered. Different configurations of LCDs utilizing semiconductor quantum dots and quantum rods as down-conversion layers are also presented, and the potential applications that are enabled by the wide range of emerging materials are highlighted."

      "White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been achieved using photopolymerization. Red and green CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) are dispersed in photopolymerized aliphatic acrylic acrylate resins, cured by using 36 W UV light for 1.5 min producing QD-acrylate nanocomposites, and then a hybrid LED device is achieved using the QD-acrylate nanocomposite with two emission wavelengths excited by using a blue InGaN LED chip. The cured QD-acrylate nanocomposite films are characterized by using ultraviolet-visible, fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis measurements. Photopolymerization is conveniently employed to adjust several parameters of the CIE-1931 coordinate (x, y), color temperature, and color rending index (CRI). Good white balance of the red-green hybrid device achieves a luminance of 7976 lm/m2 at a 30 mA working current. The light emission efficiency, CRI, and color temperature of 14%, 47, and 11 204 K, respectively, are attained at this working current."

      "The present study aimed to better characterize the morphogenesis of the femur from the embryonic to the early fetal periods. Sixty-two human fetal specimens (crown-rump length [CRL] range: 11.4-185 mm) from the Kyoto Collection were used for this study. The morphogenesis and internal differentiation process of the femur were analyzed in 3D using phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The cartilaginous femur was first observed at Carnegie stage 18. Major anatomical landmarks were formed prior to the initiation of ossification at the center of the diaphysis (CRL, 40 mm), as described by Bardeen. The region with very high signal intensity (phase 5 according to Streeter's classification; i.e., area described as cartilage disintegration) emerged at the center of the diaphysis, which split the region with slightly low signal intensity (phase 4; i.e., cartilage cells of maximum size) in fetuses with a CRL of 40.0 mm. The phase 4 and phase 5 regions became confined to the metaphysis, which might become the epiphyseal cartilage plate. Femur length and ossified shaft length (OSL) showed a strong positive correlation with CRL. The OSL-to-femur length ratio rapidly increased in fetuses with CRL between 40 and 75 mm, which became moderately increased in fetuses with a CRL of ≥75 mm. Cartilage canal invasion occurred earlier at the proximal epiphysis (CRL, 62 mm) than at the distal epiphysis (CRL, 75 mm). Morphometry and Procrustes analysis indicated that changes in the femur shape after ossification were limited, which were mainly detected at the time of initial ossification and shortly after that. In contrast, femoral neck anteversion and torsion of the femoral head continuously changed during the fetal period. Our data could aid in understanding the morphogenesis of the femur and in differentiating normal and abnormal development during the early fetal period."

      "We present a two-dimensional (2D) parity-time-symmetric (PT-symmetry) phononic crystals (PCs) with balanced gain and loss medium. Using the super cell method of rectangular lattice, we exhibit the thresholdless spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking in the band structure. The numerical results show that the asymmetric scattering properties obviously occur in a non-Hermitian system. At two specific incident frequencies, unidirectional reflectionless and perfect transmission behaviors exist individually in opposite directions, which are accompanied by a phase transition of π. Based on the generalized Snell's law, combining such a PT-symmetric medium, we design a novel metamaterial crystal for PT-symmetric acoustic flat focusing. Its focus frequency can also be modulated by the gain/loss parameter. The novel flat focusing based on the PT-symmetry that we propose opens a new door for high-dimensional applications of non-Hermitian metamaterials in acoustic wave manipulation."

      "The single-crystal SrTiO3 (001) has two different surface terminations, TiO2 and SrO. One most remarkable observation in previous studies is that only the heterointerfaces with TiO2-terminated SrTiO3, which usually combines with polar oxides such as LaAlO3, host an electron gas. Here we show that a robust electron gas can be generated between a non-polar oxide, CaHfO3, and SrTiO3 (001) with either termination. Unlike the well-known electron gas of LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the present one of CaHfO3/SrTiO3 essentially has no critical thickness of CaHfO3, can survive a long-time oxygen annealing at high temperature, and its transport properties are stable under exposure to water and other polar solvents. By electrostatic gating through CaHfO3, field-effect devices are demonstrated using CaHfO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces with both terminations. These results show that the electron gas reported in the present study is unique and promising for applications in oxide electronics."

      "In recent years, increasing efforts have been devoted to designing new functional stimuli-responsive supramolecular assemblies. Here, we present three isomeric supramolecular coordination complexes consisting of a Pd2L4 stoichiometry. As shown by NMR, CD and X-ray studies, as well as DFT calculations, these complexes form cage-like structures by chiral self-sorting. Photochromic ligands derived from first generation molecular motors enable light-driven interconversion between the three isomers. Two of the isomers were able to form host-guest complexes opening up new prospects toward stimuli-controlled substrate binding and release."

      "We report synchrotron-based operando soft X-ray microscopic photoelectron spectroscopy under charge-discharge control of single crystalline LiCoO2 (LCO) particles as an active electrode material for an all solid-state lithium-ion battery (LIB). Photoelectron mapping and the photoelectron spectrum of a selected microscopic region are obtained by a customized operando cell for LIBs. During the charge process, a more effective Li extraction from a side facet of the single crystalline LCO particle than from the central part is observed, which ensures the reliability of the system as an operando microscopic photoelectron analyzer that can track changes in the electronic structure of a selected part of the active particle. Based on these assessments, the no drastic change in the Co 2p XPS spectra during charge-discharge of LCO supports that the charge-polarization may occur at the oxygen side by strong hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p orbitals. The success of tracking the electronic-structure change at each facet of a single crystalline electrode material during charge-discharge is a major step toward the fabrication of innovative active electrode materials for LIBs."

      "Deposition of atoms or molecules on a solid surface is a flexible way to prepare various novel two-dimensional materials if the growth conditions, such as suitable surface and optimum temperature, could be predicted theoretically. However, prediction challenges modern theory of material design because the free energy criteria can hardly be applied to this issue due to the long-standing problem in statistical physics of the calculations of the free energy. Herein, we present an approach to the problem by the demonstrations of graphene and γ-graphyne on the surface of copper crystal, as well as silicene on a silver substrate. Compared with previous state-of-the-art algorithms for calculations of the free energy, our approach is capable of achieving computational precisions at least 10-times higher, which was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, and working at least four orders of magnitude faster, which enables us to obtain free energy based on ab initio calculations of the interaction potential instead of the empirical one. The approach was applied to predict the optimum conditions for silicene growth on different surfaces of solid silver based on density functional theory, and the results are in good agreement with previous experimental observations."

      "Modelling of processes involving deep Earth liquids requires information on their structures and compression mechanisms. However, knowledge of the local structures of silicates and silica (SiO2) melts at deep mantle conditions and of their densification mechanisms is still limited. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of metastable high-pressure silica phases, coesite-IV and coesite-V, using in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction and ab initio simulations. Their crystal structures are drastically different from any previously considered models, but explain well features of pair-distribution functions of highly densified silica glass and molten basalt at high pressure. Built of four, five-, and six-coordinated silicon, coesite-IV and coesite-V contain SiO6 octahedra, which, at odds with 3rd Pauling's rule, are connected through common faces. Our results suggest that possible silicate liquids in Earth's lower mantle may have complex structures making them more compressible than previously supposed."

      "Bismuth-based materials have been instrumental in the development of topological physics, even though bulk bismuth itself has been long thought to be topologically trivial. A recent study has, however, shown that bismuth is in fact a higher-order topological insulator featuring one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states protected by threefold rotational and inversion symmetries. In this paper, we uncover another hidden facet of the band topology of bismuth by showing that bismuth is also a first-order topological crystalline insulator protected by a twofold rotational symmetry. As a result, its [Formula: see text] surface exhibits a pair of gapless Dirac surface states. Remarkably, these surface Dirac cones are \"unpinned\" in the sense that they are not restricted to locate at specific k points in the [Formula: see text] surface Brillouin zone. These unpinned 2D Dirac surface states could be probed directly via various spectroscopic techniques. Our analysis also reveals the presence of a distinct, previously uncharacterized set of 1D topological hinge states protected by the twofold rotational symmetry. Our study thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the topological band structure of bismuth."

      "The N3--substituted Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors were systematically prepared and analyzed. Secondary-ion mass spectroscopy measurements revealed that the average N3- contents are 0.003 for Ca, 0.009 for Sr, and 0.032 for Ba. Furthermore, the N3- incorporation in the host lattices was corroborated by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. From the photoluminescence spectra of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors before and after N3- doping, it was verified that the enhanced emission intensity of the phosphors is most likely due to the N3- doping. In Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors, the maximum wavelengths of the emission band were red-shifted in the order Ca < Ba < Sr, which is not consistent with the trend of crystal field splitting: Ba < Sr < Ca. This discrepancy was clearly explained by electron-electron repulsions among polyhedra, LiO4-MO n , SiO4-MO n , and MO n -M'O n associated with structural difference in the host lattices. Therefore, the energy levels associated with the 4f65d energy levels of Eu2+ are definitely established in the following order: Li2CaSiO4:Eu2+ > Li2BaSiO4:Eu2+ > Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+. Furthermore, using the Williamson-Hall (W-H) method, the determined structural strains of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors revealed that the increased compressive strain after N3- doping induces the enhanced emission intensity of these phosphors. White light-emitting diodes made by three N3--doped phosphors and a 365 nm emitting InGaN chip showed the (0.333, 0.373) color coordinate and high color-rendering index (R a = 83). These phosphor materials may provide a platform for development of new efficient phosphors in solid-state lighting field."

      "Bright luminescence in rare-earth (RE) nanocrystals, the so-called nanophosphors, is generally achieved by choosing a host that enables an effective excitation of the RE activator through charge or energy transfer. Although tungstate, molybdate, or vanadate compounds provide the aforementioned transfer, a comparative analysis of the efficiency of such emitters remains elusive. Herein, we perform a combined structural and optical analysis, which reveals that the tetragonal GdVO4 matrix gives rise to the highest efficiency among the different transparent nanophosphor films compared. Then, we demonstrate that by a sequential stacking of optical quality layers made of Eu3+- and Dy3+-doped nanocrystals, it is possible to attain highly transparent white-light-emitting coatings of tunable shade with photoluminescence quantum yields above 35%. Layering provides a precise dynamic tuning of the chromaticity based on the photoexcitation wavelength dependence of the emission of the nanophosphor ensemble without altering the chemical composition of the emitters or degrading their efficiency. The total extinction of the incoming radiation along with the high quantum yields achieved makes these thin-layered phosphors one of the most efficient transparent white converter coatings ever developed."

      "Giant magnetoelectric coupling is a very rare phenomenon that has gained much attention in the past few decades due to fundamental interest as well as practical applications. Here, we have successfully achieved giant magnetoelectric coupling in PbTi1-x V x O3 (x = 0-1) using a series of generalized gradient-corrected GGA (generalized gradient approximation), including on-site Coulomb repulsion (U)-corrected spin-polarized calculations based on accurate density functional theory. Our total energy calculations show that PbTi1-x V x O3 stabilizes in C-type antiferromagnetic ground state for x > 0.123. With the substitution of V into PbTiO3, the tetragonal distortion is highly enhanced accompanied by a linear increase in polarization. In addition, our band structure analysis shows that for lower x values, the tendency to form two-dimensional magnetism of PbTi1-x V x O3 decreases. The orbital magnetic polarization was calculated with self-consistent field method by including orbital polarization correction in the calculation as well as from the computed X-ray magnetic dichroism spectra. A nonmagnetic metallic ground state is observed for the paraelectric phase for V concentration (x) = 1 competing with a volume change of 10% showing a large magnetovolume effect. Our orbital-projected density of states as well as orbital ordering analysis suggest that the orbital ordering plays a major role in the magnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition when going from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase. The calculated magnetic anisotropic energy shows that the direction [110] is the easy axis of magnetization for x = 1 composition. The partial polarization analysis shows that the Ti/V-O hybridization majorly contributes to the total electrical polarization. The present study adds a new series of compounds to the magnetoelectric family with rarely existing giant coupling between electric- and magnetic-order parameters. These results show that such kind of materials can be used for novel practical applications where one can change the magnetic properties drastically (magnetic to nonmagnetic, as shown here) with external electric field and vice versa."

      "A stable BiI3 monosheet has been grown for the first time on the (0001) surface of the topological insulator Bi2Se3 as confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy, surface X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoemision spectroscopy. BiI3 is deposited by molecular beam epitaxy from the crystalline BiTeI precursor that undergoes decomposition sublimation. The key fragment of the bulk BiI3 structure, [Formula: see text][I-Bi-I] layer of edge-sharing BiI6 octahedra, is preserved in the ultra-thin film limit, but exhibits large atomic relaxations. The stacking sequence of the trilayers and alternations of the Bi-I distances in the monosheet are the same as in the bulk BiI3 structure. Momentum resolved photoemission spectroscopy indicates a direct band gap of 1.2 eV. The Dirac surface state is completely destroyed and a new flat band appears in the band gap of the BiI3 film that could be interpreted as an interface state."

      "The study results of the perovskite solid solution and layered compounds formed in the system of (1-х)NaNbO3-xCa2Nb2O7, x = 0.10, 0.25, 0.55, 1.00 are presented. The objects of the study are obtained by solid-phase synthesis, followed by sintering using conventional ceramic technology. The study of dielectric spectra has revealed their anomalous behavior in the temperature range of 360-450 K, most pronounced in the composition with x = 0.25. To explain the anomalies in these objects, a microstructural analysis of ceramics, thermogravimetry, high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction, and IR spectroscopy heve been performed. It has been established that the anomalies of the dielectric spectra in the indicated range are due to the adsorption of water from the air, its dissociation and the incorporation of the OH2 and OH- oxyhydryl groups into the crystal lattice of the solid solution and the compounds. In a compound located near the boundary between solid solutions and layered compounds, the process of water adsorption is accompanied by the appearance of an intermediate incommensurate phase and ends with the formation of a new compound."

      "In this work, the theoretical model of non-uniform diffraction structures' holographic formation in liquid crystal-photopolymer (LC-PPM) composite materials with a dye-sensitizer is developed. The model takes into account the arbitrary character of amplitude and phase spatial distributions of recording light field, its arbitrary polarization state and also a non-linearity of the recording process. Two the most common types of liquid crystal-photopolymer composite are investigated: Holographic polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (H-PDLC) and polymer-stabilized liquid crystals (PSLC). Numerical simulations for the most common cases of holographic formation schemes are made. It is shown that due to the photo-induced Freedericksz transition, in the case of arbitrary polarization states of recording light beams, the non-uniform polarization diffraction grating (PDG) is formed in LC-PPM. Numerical simulations' results show that PDG's contribution to the change of the dielectric tensor of the media is comparable with the contribution of the photopolymerization-diffusion process."

      "Combining atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques can expedite significantly the materials discovery process. We present an application of such methodological combination for the prediction of the melting transition and amorphous-solid behavior of the NaK alloy at the eutectic concentration. We show that efficient prediction of these properties is possible via machine learning methods trained on the topological local structural properties. The configurations resulting from Monte Carlo annealing of the NaK eutectic alloy are analyzed with topological attributes based on the Voronoi tessellation and using expectation-maximization clustering and Random Forest classification. We show that the Voronoi topological fingerprints make an accurate and fast prediction of the alloy thermal behavior by cataloguing the atomic configurations into three distinct phases: liquid, amorphous solid, and crystalline solid. Melting is found at 230 K by the sharp split of configurations classified as crystalline solid and as liquid. With the proposed metrics, an arrest-motion temperature is identified at 130-140 K through a top down clustering of the atomic configurations catalogued as amorphous solid. This statistical learning paradigm is not restricted to eutectic alloys or thermodynamics, extends the utility of topological attributes in a significant way, and harnesses the discovery of new material properties."

      "GIDVis is a software package based on MATLAB specialized for, but not limited to, the visualization and analysis of grazing-incidence thin-film X-ray diffraction data obtained during sample rotation around the surface normal. GIDVis allows the user to perform detector calibration, data stitching, intensity corrections, standard data evaluation (e.g. cuts and integrations along specific reciprocal-space directions), crystal phase analysis etc. To take full advantage of the measured data in the case of sample rotation, pole figures can easily be calculated from the experimental data for any value of the scattering angle covered. As an example, GIDVis is applied to phase analysis and the evaluation of the epitaxial alignment of pentacene-quinone crystallites on a single-crystalline Au(111) surface."

      "Angular X-ray cross-correlation analysis (AXCCA) is a technique which allows quantitative measurement of the angular anisotropy of X-ray diffraction patterns and provides insights into the orientational order in the system under investigation. This method is based on the evaluation of the angular cross-correlation function of the scattered intensity distribution on a two-dimensional (2D) detector and further averaging over many diffraction patterns for enhancement of the anisotropic signal. Over the last decade, AXCCA was successfully used to study the anisotropy in various soft matter systems, such as solutions of anisotropic particles, liquid crystals, colloidal crystals, superlattices composed by nanoparticles, etc. This review provides an introduction to the technique and gives a survey of the recent experimental work in which AXCCA in combination with micro- or nanofocused X-ray microscopy was used to study the orientational order in various soft matter systems."

      "In quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum transitions is grounded on the convergence of a series of time-dependent perturbation theory. In nuclear and atomic physics, this series converges because the dynamics of quantum transitions (quantum jumps) are absent by definition. In molecular and chemical physics, on the contrary, the dynamics of \"quantum\" transitions, being determined by the joint motion of a light electron (or electrons) and very heavy nuclei, are present by definition, and the series of time-dependent perturbation theory becomes singular. An exception is the dynamic problem for stationary states in the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic approximation, when the electronic subsystem turns out to be \"off\" from the general dynamic process and therefore is not dynamically full-fledged: it only forms an electric potential in which the nuclei oscillate. Removing the aforementioned singularity can be accomplished in two ways. The first method was consisted of introducing an additional postulate in the form of the Franck-Condon principle into molecular quantum mechanics, in which the adiabatic approximation is used. The second method was proposed by the author and consisted of damping the singular dynamics of the joint motion of an electron and nuclei in the intermediate (transient) state of molecular \"quantum\" transitions by introducing chaos. This chaos arises only during molecular quantum transitions and is called dozy chaos. Formally, the damping is carried out by replacing an infinitely small imaginary addition in the spectral representation of the complete Green's function of the system with its finite quantity. The damping chaos (dozy chaos) leads to the continuity of the energy spectrum in the molecular transient state, which is a sign of classical mechanics. Meanwhile, the initial and final states of the molecule obey quantum mechanics in the adiabatic approximation. Molecular quantum mechanics, which takes into account the chaotic dynamics of the transient state of molecular \"quantum\" transitions, can be called quantum-classical (dozy-chaos) mechanics. The efficacy of the damping for the aforementioned singularity was previously shown by dozy-chaos mechanics of elementary electron transfers in condensed matter, which is the simplest case of dozy-chaos mechanics, and its applications to a whole number of problems, especially to the optical spectra in polymethine dyes and their aggregates. This paper provides a regular exposition of this dozy-chaos (quantum-classical) mechanics of the elementary electron transfers. The main results of its applications presented in the introduction are also described."

      "The nature of the Verwey transition occurring at TV ≈ 125 K in magnetite (Fe3O4) has been an outstanding problem over many decades. A complex low temperature electronic order was recently discovered and associated structural fluctuations persisting above TV are widely reported, but the origin of the underlying correlations and hence of the Verwey transition remains unclear. Here we show that local structural fluctuations in magnetite emerge below the Curie transition at TC ≈ 850 K, through X-ray pair distribution function analysis. Around 80% of the low temperature correlations emerge in proportion to magnetization below TC. This confirms that fluctuations in Fe-Fe bonding arising from magnetic order are the primary electronic instability and hence the origin of the Verwey transition. Such hidden instabilities may be important to other spin-polarised conductors and orbitally degenerate materials."

      "Nano-TiO2 has always been one of the most important topics in the research of photocatalysts due to its special activity and stability. However, it has always been difficult to obtain nano-TiO2 with high dispersion, a small particle size and high photocatalytic activity. In this paper, nano-TiO2 powder was prepared by combining the high-gravity technique and direct precipitation method in an impinging stream-rotating packed bed (IS-RPB) reactor followed by Fe3+ in-situ doping. TiOSO4 and NH3·H2O solutions were cut into very small liquid microelements by high-speed rotating packing, and the mass transfer and microscopic mixing of the nucleation and growth processes of nano-TiO2 were strengthened in IS-RPB, which was beneficial to the continuous production of high quality nano-TiO2. Pure TiO2 and iron-doped nano-TiO2 (Fe-TiO2) were obtained in IS-RPB and were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, which found that pure TiO2 had a particle size of about 12.5 nm, good dispersibility and a complete anatase crystal at the rotating speed of packing of 800 rpm and calcination temperature of 500 °C. The addition of Fe3+ did not change the crystalline structure of TiO2. Iron was highly dispersed in TiO2 without the detection of aggregates and was found to exist in a positive trivalent form by XPS. With the increase of iron doping, the photoresponse range of TiO2 to visible light was broadened from 3.06 eV to 2.26 eV. The degradation efficiency of gaseous toluene by Fe-TiO2 under ultraviolet light was higher than that of pure TiO2 and commercial P25 due to Fe3+ effectively suppressing the recombination of TiO2 electrons and holes; the highest efficiency produced by 1.0% Fe-TiO2 was 95.7%."

      "In nanomaterials, the surface or the subsurface structures influence the friction behaviors greatly. In this work, nanoscale friction behaviors between a rigid cylinder tip and a single crystal copper substrate are studied by molecular dynamics simulation. Nanoscale textured surfaces are modeled on the surface of the substrate to represent the surface structures, and the spacings between textures are seen as defects on the surface. Nano-defects are prepared at the subsurface of the substrate. The effects of depth, orientation, width and shape of textured surfaces on the average friction forces are investigated, and the influence of subsurface defects in the substrate is also studied. Compared with the smooth surface, textured surfaces can improve friction behaviors effectively. The textured surfaces with a greater depth or smaller width lead to lower friction forces. The surface with 45° texture orientation produces the lowest average friction force among all the orientations. The influence of the shape is slight, and the v-shape shows a lower average friction force. Besides, the subsurface defects in the substrate make the sliding process unstable and the influence of subsurface defects on friction forces is sensitive to their positions."

      "Hybrid metal nanoparticles, consisting of a nano-crystalline metal core and a protecting shell of organic ligand molecules, have applications in diverse areas such as biolabeling, catalysis, nanomedicine, and solar energy. Despite a rapidly growing database of experimentally determined atom-precise nanoparticle structures and their properties, there has been no successful, systematic way to predict the atomistic structure of the metal-ligand interface. Here, we devise and validate a general method to predict the structure of the metal-ligand interface of ligand-stabilized gold and silver nanoparticles, based on information about local chemical environments of atoms in experimental data. In addition to predicting realistic interface structures, our method is useful for investigations on the steric effects at the metal-ligand interface, as well as for predicting isomers and intermediate structures induced by thermal dynamics or interactions with the environment. Our method is applicable to other hybrid nanomaterials once a suitable set of reference structures is available."

      "The design and synthesis of three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) have still been considered as a big challenge. Here we report the design and synthesis of an AIEgen-based 3D COF (3D-TPE-COF), with a high surface area (1084 m2 g-1). According to powder X-ray diffraction and continuous rotation electron diffraction analyses, 3D-TPE-COF is identified to adopt a seven-fold interpenetrated pts topology. Interestingly, 3D-TPE-COF emits yellow fluorescence upon excitation, with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 20%. Moreover, by simply coating 3D-TPE-COF onto a commercial blue light-emitting diode (LED), a prototype white LED (WLED) under continuously driving without degradation for 1200 h was demonstrated. The present work suggests the possibility of using COF materials for stable WLEDs, which will greatly inspire us to design and synthesize fluorescent 3D COFs and facilitate the development of COF-based WLEDs in future."

      "Tungsten is the main candidate material for plasma-facing armour components in future fusion reactors. In-service, fusion neutron irradiation creates lattice defects through collision cascades. Helium, injected from plasma, aggravates damage by increasing defect retention. Both can be mimicked using helium-ion-implantation. In a recent study on 3000 appm helium-implanted tungsten (W-3000He), we hypothesized helium-induced irradiation hardening, followed by softening during deformation. The hypothesis was founded on observations of large increase in hardness, substantial pile-up and slip-step formation around nano-indents and Laue diffraction measurements of localised deformation underlying indents. Here we test this hypothesis by implementing it in a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) formulation, simulating nano-indentation in W-3000He at 300 K. The model considers thermally-activated dislocation glide through helium-defect obstacles, whose barrier strength is derived as a function of defect concentration and morphology. Only one fitting parameter is used for the simulated helium-implanted tungsten; defect removal rate. The simulation captures the localised large pile-up remarkably well and predicts confined fields of lattice distortions and geometrically necessary dislocation underlying indents which agree quantitatively with previous Laue measurements. Strain localisation is further confirmed through high resolution electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements on cross-section lift-outs from centre of nano-indents in W-3000He."

      "Cesium lead halide nanocrystals (CsPbX3 NCs) are new inorganic light sources covering the entire visible spectral range and exhibiting near-unity efficiencies. While the last years have seen rapid progress in green and red electroluminescence from CsPbX3 NCs, the development of blue counterparts remained rather stagnant. Controlling the surface state of CsPbX3 NCs had proven to be a major factor governing the efficiency of the charge injection and for diminishing the density of traps. Although didodecyldimethylammonium halides (DDAX; X = Br, Cl) had been known to improve the luminescence of CsPbX3 NCs when applied postsynthetically, they had not been used as the sole long-chain ammonium ligand directly in the synthesis of these NCs. Herein we report a facile, direct synthesis of DDAX-stabilized CsPbX3 NCs. We then demonstrate blue and green light-emitting diodes, characterized by the electroluminescence at 463-515 nm and external quantum efficiencies of 9.80% for green, 4.96% for sky-blue, and 1.03% for deep-blue spectral regions."

      "Triple-layered Sr4Ru3O10 is a unique ferromagnet with the central RuO6 layer behaving differently from two outer layers both crystallographically and magnetically. We report that the partial substitution of Ru by smaller Mn gives rise to modification in crystal structure, electronic and magnetic properties of Sr4(Ru1-xMnx)3O10. Through the single crystal X-ray diffraction refinement, we find that (Ru/Mn)O6 octahedral rotation is no longer detectable at x ≥ 0.23, leading to the tetragonal structure. The magnetization measurements indicate the ferromagnetic transition temperature TC decreases from 105 K for x = 0 to 30 K for x = 0.41, with the reduced magnetic moment as well. Remarkably, Mn doping results in the change of magnetic anisotropy from the easy c axis in x = 0 to the easy ab plane seen in x = 0.34 and 0.41. Such change also removes the ab-plane metamagnetic transition observed in x = 0. Furthermore, the electrical resistivity increases with increasing x showing semiconducting behavior with Δ ~ 10 meV for x = 0.34 and 30 meV for x = 0.41. Under applied magnetic field, the magnetoresistance exhibits negative and linear field dependence in all current and field configurations. These results clearly indicate Sr4(Ru1-xMnx)3O10 is a novel ferromagnetic semiconductor with exotic magnetotransport properties."

      "We address the anisotropic oxygen diffusion in PrBaCo2O5.5 using first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. First, the experimentally observed magnetic properties such as ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and paramagnetic phases are examined through systematic consideration of cobalt spin ordering and oxygen vacancy position. Then, the diffusion mechanism of an oxygen atom, assumed to be externally supplied, is explored by evaluating the oxygen migration barriers with the formation of one-dimensional oxygen-vacancy channel."

      "Aeromonas veronii strain A134 was isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa colonies collected from Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel. The Aeromonas culture media inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa (strain MGK). The crude extract of a large-scale culture of A. veronii A134 was separated in a few chromatographic steps to yield three new secondary metabolites, 9-chlorolumichrome (1), veronimide (2) and veronipyrazine (3), along with a known lumichrome and several known diketopiperazines. The structures of the new compounds were established by analyses of the data from 1D and 2D NMR experiments and HRMS data of the compounds, as well as a single-crystal x-ray analysis of synthetic 1. The structure elucidation and proposed biogenesis of the new compounds are described below."

      "Noise is considered as one of the challenging problems in big cities. However, this noise could be utilized in producing energy especially in dense urban areas. Sound as a form of mechanical energy, it can be converted to electric energy through many approaches including heating, by using the diaphragm and through using piezoelectric materials. This research aims at utilizing noise through using piezoelectric materials as an approach of conversion to produce green sustainable electric energy that can be used to decrease the energy consumption from non-renewable sources and utilizing this energy in street lighting. The study was carried in three bus stations in Alexandria by having measurements during weekdays and weekends in order to study the noise produced in the selected stations and the amount of electric energy that could be produced and utilized in street lighting. The noise level index LDEN was calculated for each of the three selected locations. The equivalent noise level values were always exceeding the limits through the day, evening and night. At daytime they ranged between 75-85 dB which is higher that the permissible limit by 10-20 dB, at evening they ranged from 80-85 dB which is also higher than the permissible limit with 20-25 dB and at the night they ranged from 75-80 dB which is higher by 20-25 dB than the permissible limit. The research concluded that utilizing noise using the piezoelectric material is successful. The electric energy produced from an area of 1.45 m2 containing 690 piezoelectric QB220-503YB transducers at each of the selected stations was about 0.024 watt hr. This amount of electric energy is too small to be used in an application. So the application area should be maximized to hundreds of square meters to produce beneficial electric energy that can be used in lighting 1 LED street lamp or it can be stored and used when needed in applications that use greater amount of electric energy and this would help in reducing the energy consumed."

      "The results of studies on the influence of periodically stacked nanolayer inclusions, introduced into the face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) hard sphere crystal, on Poisson's ratio of the obtained nanocomposite system are presented. The monolayers are orthogonal to the [ 001 ] -direction. They are formed by hard spheres with diameter different from the spheres forming the matrix of the system. The Monte Carlo computer simulations show that in such a case the symmetry of the system changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. When the diameter of the inclusion spheres increases at certain range, a decrease of the negative Poisson's ratio in the [ 101 ] [ 1 ¯ 01 ] -directions is observed, i.e., the system enhances its partial auxeticity. The dependence of the maximal, average, and negative parts of the minimal Poisson's ratio on the direction of the applied load are shown in a form of surfaces in spherical coordinates, plotted for selected values of nanolayer particle diameters. The most negative value of the Poisson's ratio found among all studied systems was - 0.11 (at pressure p * = 100 , which is about ten times higher than the melting pressure) what is almost twice more negative than in the f.c.c. crystal of identical hard spheres. The observed effect weakens along with the decrease of pressure and becomes hardly noticeable near melting. This study indicates that modifying only the size of the inclusion particles one can change Poisson's ratio of nanocomposites at high pressures."

      "Subnanometric metal clusters exhibit anomalous catalytic activity, suggesting innovative applications as next-generation materials, although identifying and characterizing these subnanomaterials in atomic detail remains a substantial challenge because of the severely weak signal intensity for the conventional analytical methods. Here, we report a subnanosensitive vibrational technique established based on the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, demonstrating the first-ever detailed vibrational characterization of subnanomaterials. Furthermore, combining with density functional theory calculations, we reveal that inherent surface structures of the tin oxide subnanoclusters determine the size-specific spectral and catalytic characteristics of these clusters. The high-sensitivity characterization methodology elaborated here can provide a comprehensive understanding of the chemical and structural natures of subnanomaterials, which facilitate the rational design of subnanomaterials on the atomic scale for practical applications, such as in catalysts, biosensors, and electronics."

      "Search for topological materials has been actively promoted in the field of condensed matter physics for their potential application in energy-efficient information transmission and processing. Recent studies have revealed that topologically invariant states, such as edge states in topological insulators, can emerge not only in a fermionic electron system but also in a bosonic system, enabling nondissipative propagation of quasiparticles. Here we report the topologically nontrivial triplon bands measured by inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1/2 two-dimensional dimerized antiferromagnet Ba2CuSi2O6Cl2. The excitation spectrum exhibits two triplon bands that are clearly separated by a band gap due to a small alternation in interdimer exchange interaction, consistent with a refined crystal structure. By analytically modeling the triplon dispersion, we show that Ba2CuSi2O6Cl2 is the first bosonic realization of the coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where the presence of topologically protected edge states is prompted by a bipartite nature of the lattice."

      "Melamine (IUPAC: 1,3,5-Triazine-2,4,6-triamine) attracts high attention in analytical vibrational spectroscopy due to its misuse as a food adulterant. Vibrational spectroscopy [infrared (IR) and Raman and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy] is a major quality control tool in the detection and quantification of melamine content. The physical background for the measured spectra is not interpreted in analytical spectroscopy using chemometrics. In contrast, quantum mechanical calculations are capable of providing deep and independent insights therein. So far, the NIR region of crystalline melamine has not been studied by quantum mechanical calculations, while the investigations of its IR spectra have remained limited. In the present work, we employed fully anharmonic calculation of the NIR spectrum of melamine based on finite models, and also performed IR spectral simulation by using an infinite crystal model-periodic in three dimensions. This yielded detailed and unambiguous NIR band assignments and revised the previously known IR band assignments. We found that the out-of-plane fundamental transitions, which are essential in the IR region, are markedly more sensitive to out-of-plane inter-molecular interactions of melamine than NIR transitions. Proper description of the chemical surrounding of the molecule of melamine is more important than the anharmonicity of its vibrations. In contrast, the NIR bands mostly arise from in-plane vibrations, and remain surprisingly insensitive to the chemical environment. These findings explain previous observations that were reported in IR and NIR analytical studies of melamine."

      "A previously unreported tetragonal phase has been discovered in a epitaxially strained GdMnO3 thin films deposited on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The tetragonal axis of the films grown up to a 35 nm thickness is perpendicular to the film surface and the basal lattice parameters are imposed by the cubic structure of the substrate. Furthermore, the emergence of a spontaneous electric polarization below ~32 K points to the stabilization of an improper ferroelectric phase at low temperatures, which is not observed in bulk GdMnO3. This work shows how strain engineering can be used to tailor the structure and properties of strongly correlated oxides."

      "It is well known that, under plastic deformation, dislocations are not only created but also move through the crystal, and their mobility is impeded by their interaction with the crystal structure. At high stress and temperature, this \"drag\" is dominated by phonon wind, i.e., phonons scattering off dislocations. Employing the semi-isotropic approach discussed in detail in a previous paper (J. Phys. Chem. Solids 2019, 124, 24⁻35), we discuss here the approximate functional dependence of dislocation drag B on dislocation velocity in various regimes between a few percent of transverse sound speed c T and c T (where c T is the effective average transverse sound speed of the polycrystal). In doing so, we find an effective functional form for dislocation drag B ( v ) for different slip systems and dislocation characters at fixed (room) temperature and low pressure."

      "Anatase TiO2 provides photoactivity with high chemical stability at a reasonable cost. Different methods have been used to enhance its photocatalytic activity by creating band gap states through the introduction of oxygen vacancies, hydrogen impurities, or the adorption of phthalocyanines, which are usually employed as organic dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells. Predicting how these interactions affect the electronic structure of anatase requires an efficient and robust theory. In order to document the efficiency and accuracy of commonly used approaches we have considered two widely used implementations of density functional theory (DFT), namely the all-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals (AE-LCAO) and the pseudo-potential plane waves (PP-PW) approaches, to calculate the properties of the stoichiometric and defective anatase TiO2 (101) surface. Hybrid functionals, and in particular HSE, lead to a computed band gap in agreement with that measured by using UV adsorption spectroscopy. When using PBE+U, the gap is underestimated by 20 % but the computed position of defect induced gap states relative to the conduction band minimum (CBM) are found to be in good agreement with those calculated using hybrid functionals. These results allow us to conclude that hybrid functionals based on the use of AE-LCAO provide an efficient and robust approach for predicting trends in the band gap and the position of gap states in large model systems. We extend this analysis to surface adsorption and use the AE-LCAO approach with the hybrid functional HSED3 to study the adsorption of the phthalocyanine H2Pc on anatase (101). Our results suggest that H2Pc prefers to be adsorbed on the surface Ti5c rows of anatase (101), in agreement with that seen in recent STM experiments on rutile (110)."

      "One of the current challenges in nanoscience is tailoring the phononic properties of a material. This has long been a rather elusive task because several phonons have wavelengths in the nanometer range. Thus, high quality nanostructuring at that length-scale, unavailable until recently, is necessary for engineering the phonon spectrum. Here we report on the continuous tuning of the phononic properties of a twinning superlattice GaP nanowire by controlling its periodicity. Our experimental results, based on Raman spectroscopy and rationalized by means of ab initio theoretical calculations, give insight into the relation between local crystal structure, overall lattice symmetry, and vibrational properties, demonstrating how material engineering at the nanoscale can be successfully employed in the rational design of the phonon spectrum of a material."

      "We report on an emerging symmetry axis in the magnetoresistance of bulk single crystals of quasi-one-dimensional Li0.9Mo6O17 below T min = 25 K, the temperature at which the electrical resistivity experiences a minimum. Detailed angle-dependent magnetoresistance sweeps reveal that this symmetry axis is induced by the development of a negative magnetoresistance, which is suppressed only for magnetic fields oriented along the poles of the MoO6 octahedra that form the conducting chains. We show that this unusual negative magnetoresistance is consistent with the melting of dark excitons, composed of previously omitted orbitals within the t 2g manifold that order below T min. The unveiled symmetry axis in directional magnetic fields not only provides evidence for the crystallization of these dark excitons but also sheds new light on the long-standing mystery of the metal-insulator transition in Li0.9Mo6O17."

      "We use first-principle calculations based on hybrid functional and the Bethe-Salpeter equation method to investigate the electronic and optical properties of dichalcogenide TlGaTe2. Based on theoretical studies, TlGaTe2 has until recently been considered as an indirect band gap material, however; by employing more accurate hybrid functional model, we showed that although TlGaTe2 has an indirect band gap of 1.109 eV, it also exhibits a fundamental direct band gap of 1.129 eV. Our finding was further confirmed by the optical studies on TlGaTe2, which show that the absorption peak is registered at a photon energy of 1.129 eV. It was also shown that TlGaTe2 has high optical absorption peaks in the visible region. Based on phonon and elastic constant calculations, it was shown that TlGaTe2 is dynamically and mechanically stable. Our findings show that TlGaTe2 is a potential candidate for photovoltaic application."

      "The examination of anisotropic nanostructures, such as wires, platelets or spikes, inside a transmission electron microscope is normally performed only in plan view. However, intrinsic defects such as growth twin interfaces could occasionally be concealed from direct observation for geometric reasons, leading to superposition. This article presents the shadow-focused ion-beam technique to prepare multiple electron-beam-transparent cross-section specimens of ZnO nanospikes, via a procedure which could be readily extended to other anisotropic structures. In contrast with plan-view data of the same nanospikes, here the viewing direction allows the examination of defects without superposition. By this method, the coexistence of two twin configurations inside the wurtzite-type structure is observed, namely and , which were not identified during the plan-view observations owing to superposition of the domains. The defect arrangement could be the result of coalescence twinning of crystalline nuclei formed on the partially molten Zn substrate during the flame-transport synthesis. Three-dimensional defect models of the twin interface structures have been derived and are correlated with the plan-view investigations by simulation."

      "Emerging phototherapy in a clinic and plant photomorphogenesis call for efficient red/far-red light resources to target and/or actuate the interaction of light and living organisms. Rare-earth-doped phosphors are generally promising candidates for efficient light-emitting diodes but still bear lower quantum yield for the far-red components, potential supply risks, and high-cost issues. Thus, the design and preparation of efficient non-rare-earth activated phosphors becomes extremely important and arouses great interest. Fabrication of Cr3+-doped Na3AlF6 phosphors significantly promotes the potential applications by efficiently converting blue excitation light of a commercial InGaN chip to far-red broadband emission in the 640-850 nm region. The action response of phototherapy (∼667-683 nm; ∼750-772 nm) and that of photomorphogenesis (∼700-760 nm) are well overlapped. Based on the temperature-dependent steady luminescence and time-resolved spectroscopies, energy transfer models are rationally established by means of the configurational coordinate diagram of Cr3+ ions. An optimal sample of Na3AlF6:60% Cr3+ phosphor generates a notable QY of 75 ± 5%. Additionally, an InGaN LED device encapsulated by using Na3AlF6:60% Cr3+ phosphor was fabricated. The current exploration will pave a promising way to engineer non-rare-earth activated optoelectronic devices for all kinds of photobiological applications."

      "Near-infrared luminescent materials exhibit unique photophysical properties that make them crucial components in photonic, optoelectronic and biological applications. As broadband near infrared phosphors activated by transition metal elements are already widely reported, there is a challenge for next-generation materials discovery by introducing rare earth activators with 4f-5d transition. Here, we report an unprecedented phosphor K3LuSi2O7:Eu2+ that gives an emission band centered at 740 nm with a full-width at half maximum of 160 nm upon 460 nm blue light excitation. Combined structural and spectral characterizations reveal a selective site occupation of divalent europium in LuO6 and K2O6 polyhedrons with small coordination numbers, leading to the unexpected near infrared emission. The fabricated phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes have great potential as a non-visible light source. Our work provides the design principle of near infrared emission in divalent europium-doped inorganic solid-state materials and could inspire future studies to further explore near-infrared light-emitting diodes."

      "We present a one-step method to produce air-stable, large-grain mixed cationic lead perovskite films and powders under ambient conditions. The introduction of 2.5 % of Zn(II), confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), results in stable thin films which show the same absorption and crystal structure after 2 weeks of storage under ambient conditions. Next to prolonged stability, the introduction of Zn(II) affects photophysical properties, reducing the bulk defect density, enhancing the photoluminescence (PL), and extending the charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, 3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride is applied as the film-forming agent. The presence of this amine hydrochloride additive results in highly oriented and large crystal domains showing an ulterior improvement of PL intensity and lifetime. The material can also be prepared as black precursor powder by a solid-solid reaction under ambient conditions and can be pressed into a perovskite pellet. The prolonged stability and the easy fabrication in air makes this material suitable for large-scale, low-cost processing for optoelectronic applications."

      "Long-range charge transport is important for many applications like batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and catalysis. Obtaining microscopic insights into the atomistic mechanism is challenging, in particular if the underlying processes involve protons as the charge carriers. Here, large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations employing an efficient density-functional-theory-based neural network potential are used to unravel long-range proton transport mechanisms at solid-liquid interfaces, using the zinc oxide-water interface as a prototypical case. We find that the two most frequently occurring ZnO surface facets, (101[combining macron]0) and (112[combining macron]0), that typically dominate the morphologies of zinc oxide nanowires and nanoparticles, show markedly different proton conduction behaviors along the surface with respect to the number of possible proton transfer mechanisms, the role of the solvent for long-range proton migration, as well as the proton transport dimensionality. Understanding such surface-facet-specific mechanisms is crucial for an informed bottom-up approach for the functionalization and application of advanced oxide materials."

      "Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is well-known as one of the most promising chromogenic compounds. It has a drastic change of coloration induced from different external stimuli and so its applications are developed as gas sensors, electrochromic panels or photochromic sensors. This paper focuses on the photochromic properties of nanoWO3, with tunable composition (with tunable oxygen sub-stoichiometry). Three reference samples with yellow, blue and black colors were prepared from polyol synthesis followed by post annealing under air, none post-annealing treatment, or a post-annealing under argon atmosphere. These three samples differ in terms of crystallographic structure (cubic system versus monoclinic system), oxygen vacancy concentration, electronic band diagram with occurrence of free or trapped electrons and their photochromic behavior. Constituting one main finding, it is shown that the photochromic behavior is highly dependent on the compound's composition/color. Rapid and important change of coloration under UV (ultraviolet) irradiation was evidenced especially on the blue compound, i.e., the photochromic coloring efficiency of this compound in terms of contrast between bleached and colored phase, as the kinetic aspect is high. The photochromism is reversible in a few hours. This hence opens a new window for the use of tungsten oxide as smart photochromic compounds."

      "Transverse thermoelectric materials can achieve appreciable cooling power with minimal space requirement. Among all types of material candidates for transverse thermoelectric applications, composite materials have the best cooling performance. In this study, anisotropic material properties were applied to the component phase of transverse thermoelectric composites. A mathematical model was established for predicting the performance of fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites with anisotropic components. The mathematical model was then validated by finite element analysis. The thermoelectric performance of three types of composites are presented, each with the same set of component materials. For each type of component, both anisotropic single-crystal and isotropic polycrystal material properties were applied. The results showed that the cooling capacity of the system was improved by introducing material anisotropy in the component phase of composite. The results also indicated that the orientation of the anisotropic component's property axis, the anisotropic characteristic of a material, will significantly influence the thermoelectric performance of the composite. For a composite material consisting of Copper fiber and Bi2Te3 matrix, the maximum cooling capacity can vary as much as 50% at 300 K depending on the property axis alignment of Bi2Te3 in the composite. The composite with Copper and anisotropic SnSe single crystal had a 51% improvement in the maximum cooling capacity compared to the composite made of Copper and isotropic SnSe polycrystals."

      "The (011) termination of rutile TiO2 is reported to be particularly effective for photocatalysis. Here, the structure of the interface formed between this substrate and water is revealed using surface X-ray diffraction. While the TiO2(011) surface exhibits a (2 × 1) reconstruction in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), this is lifted in the presence of a multilayer of water at room temperature. This change is driven by the formation of Ti-OH at the interface, which has a bond distance of 1.93 ± 0.02 Å. The experimental solution is in good agreement with density functional theory and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations. These results point to the important differences that can arise between the structure of oxide surfaces in UHV and technical environments and will ultimately lead to an atomistic understanding of the photocatalytic process of water splitting on TiO2 surfaces."

      "At the detonation of condensed explosives, on the profile of electric conductivity is observed the area of high values, which is usually associated with the chemical reaction zone. The new interpretation of experimental data on the electrical conductivity allows one to diagnose the influence of the grain size on the charge structure and the reaction zone in the whole range of densities investigated. The reliability of the proposed hypotheses are investigated by the methods of statistical analysis. The level of confidence shows the consistency. The results of this paper are useful for the explosion physics, for the industrial production of nanodiamonds, for the miniaturization of explosive devices."

      "Passivation of magnesium metal anode is one of the critical challenges for the development of magnesium batteries. Here we investigated the passivation process of an intermetallic anode: Mg3Bi2 synthesized by solid-state and thin film process. The Mg3Bi2 composite electrode shows excellent reversibility in magnesium bis(trifluoromethansulfonylamide) dissolved in acetonitrile, while Mg3Sb2, which has same crystal structure and similar chemical properties, is electrochemically inactive. We also fabricated the Mg3Bi2 thin film electrodes, which show reversibility with low overpotential not only in the acetonitrile solution but also glyme-based solutions. Surface layer corresponding to the decomposed TFSA anion is slightly suppressed in the case of the Mg3Bi2 thin film electrode, compared with Mg metal. Comparative study of hydrolysis process of the Mg3Bi2 and the Mg3Sb2 suggests that the both intermetallic anodes are not completely passivated. The bond valence sum mapping of the Mg3Bi2 indicates that the fast Mg2+ diffusion pathway between 2d tetrahedral sites is formed. The electrochemical properties of the Mg3Bi2 anode is mainly due to the less passivation surface with the fast Mg2+ diffusion pathways."

      "Understanding the effect of dislocations on the mass transport in ionic ceramics is important for understanding the behavior of these materials in a variety of contexts. In particular, the dissociated nature of vacancies at screw dislocations, or more generally, at a wide range of low-angle twist grain-boundaries, has ramifications for the mechanism of defect migration and thus mass transport at these microstructural features. In this paper, a systematic study of the dissociated vacancies at screw dislocations in MgO is carried out. The important role of stress migration in the atomistic modeling study is identified. Another aspect of the current work is a rigorous treatment of the linear elasticity model. As a result, good agreement between the atomistic modeling results and the linear elasticity model is obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed vacancy dissociation mechanism can also be extended to more complicated ionic ceramics such as UO2, highlighting the generality of the mechanism."

      "Devices consisting of polymer disks (PDs) of optically clear or translucent, medical-grade silicone loaded with a new hydrophobic, oxygen-stable, photoactivated nitric oxide-releasing moiety (photoNORM) are described. The photoNORM is the new O-nitrito chromium(III) complex trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2](BF4) (PetA = 5,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-1,4,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane), of which the synthesis, X-ray crystal structure, and solution-phase photochemistry are described. Several different commercially available silicone polymers were tested with this photoNORM, and nitric oxide photouncaging with 451 nm light from these systems is compared. In addition, PDs were loaded with the photoNORM and neodymium-sensitized upconverting nanoparticles (Nd-UCNPs). The Nd-UCNPs absorb NIR light at ∼800 nm and activate NO release from the trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]+ cation. The use of such ensembles as implants provides a potential strategy for the in vivo uncaging of NO at physiological targets triggered by tissue-transmitting NIR excitation. Also reported are the X-ray crystal structures of cis- and trans-{Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl."

      "The transition from nanocluster to nanocrystal is a central issue in nanoscience. The atomic structure determination of metal nanoparticles in the transition size range is challenging and particularly important in understanding the quantum size effect at the atomic level. On the basis of the rationale that the intra- and interparticle weak interactions play critical roles in growing high-quality single crystals of metal nanoparticles, we have reproducibly obtained ideal crystals of Au144(SR)60 and successfully solved its structure by x-ray crystallography (XRC); this structure was theoretically predicted a decade ago and has long been pursued experimentally but without success until now. Here, XRC reveals an interesting Au12 hollow icosahedron in thiolated gold nanoclusters for the first time. The Au-Au bond length, close to that of bulk gold, shows better thermal extensibility than the other Au-Au bond lengths in Au144(SR)60, providing an atomic-level perspective because metal generally shows better thermal extensibility than nonmetal materials. Thus, our work not only reveals the mysterious, long experimentally pursued structure of a transition-sized nanoparticle but also has important implications for the growth of high-quality, single-crystal nanoparticles, as well as for the understanding of the thermal extensibility of metals from the perspective of chemical bonding."

      "Nanostructuring of bulk metals is now well documented with the development of severe plastic deformation (SPD) for improving the physical and mechanical properties of engineering materials. Processing by high-pressure torsion (HPT), which was developed initially as a grain refinement technique, was extended recently to the mechanical bonding of dissimilar metals during nanostrcturing which generally involves significant microstructural heterogeneity. Here we introduce, for the first time, a bulk metastable Al-Mg supersaturated solid solution by the diffusion bonding of separate Al and Mg metal solids at room temperature using HPT. Exceptional hardness was achieved homogeneously throughout the metastable alloy with a record maximum supersaturated Mg content of ~38.5 at.% in the Al matrix having a grain size of ~35-40 nm. Our results demonstrate the synthesis of a bulk nanocrystalline metastable alloy with good microstructural stability at room temperature where such bulk solids are not yet reported for mechanical alloying by powder metallurgy."

      "In this study, green-emitting nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDots) were synthesized and incorporated into drop-cast composite films for use as color conversion layers in a white-LED configuration to generate white light. In order to resolve the red deficiency of this configuration, a commercial red phosphor was integrated into the system. Moreover, the N-CDots were also processed into polymer/N-CDot composite fibers, for which we determined the amount of N-CDots that yielded adequate white-light properties. Finally, we showed that white light with excellent properties could be generated by employing both of the fabricated N-CDot composites either as drop-cast films or composite fibers. Hence, N-CDots provide a promising alternative to inorganic phosphors that are commonly employed in white-LED configurations."

      "The pseudogap phenomenon in the cuprates is arguably the most mysterious puzzle in the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The tetragonal cuprate HgBa2CuO4+δ, with only one CuO2 layer per primitive cell, is an ideal system to tackle this puzzle. Here, we measure the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy within the CuO2 plane with exceptionally high-precision magnetic torque experiments. Our key finding is that a distinct two-fold in-plane anisotropy sets in below the pseudogap temperature T*, which provides thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase transition with broken four-fold symmetry. Surprisingly, the nematic director orients along the diagonal direction of the CuO2 square lattice, in sharp contrast to the bond nematicity along the Cu-O-Cu direction. Another remarkable feature is that the enhancement of the diagonal nematicity with decreasing temperature is suppressed around the temperature at which short-range charge-density-wave formation occurs. Our result suggests a competing relationship between diagonal nematic and charge-density-wave order in HgBa2CuO4+δ."

      "Terrestrial analogues are often investigated to get insights into the geological processes occurring on other planetary bodies. Due to its thickness and petrological similarities, the pyroxenitic layer of the 120m-thick magmatic pile Theo's Flow (Archean Abitibi greenstone belt Ontario, Canada), has always been regarded as the terrestrial analogue for Martian nakhlites. However, its origin and cooling history and, as a consequence those of nakhlites, have always been a matter of vigorous debate. Did this lava flow originate from a single magmatic event similar to those supposed to occur on Mars or do the different units derive from multiple eruptions? We demonstrate, by a combination of geothermometric constraints on augite single crystals and numerical simulations, that Theo's Flow has been formed by multiple magma emplacements that occurred at different times. This discovery supports the idea that the enormous lava flows with similar compositions observed on Mars could be the result of a process where low viscosity lavas are emplaced during multiple eruptions. This has profound implications for understanding the multiscale mechanisms of lava flow emplacement on Earth and other planetary bodies."

      "Novel tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complexes with five-membered N-heteroaromatic ligands, (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4L] [L = imidazole (Him) (2), 1-methylimidazole (Mim) (3), and pyrazole (pyz) (4)] and (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4L]·L [L = Him (5) and Mim (6)], were synthesized by the reactions of (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4] (1) with Him, Mim, and pyz, and their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The complexes 2, 3, 4, and 6 showed intense photoluminescence, with the emission quantum yields (Φem) being 0.65-0.75 in the solid state at 296 K. In contrast, the Φem and τem values of 5 are significantly smaller and shorter, respectively, than the relevant values of 2. The interconversion reactions among 1, 2, and 5 accompanied by large photoluminescence-intensity changes were accomplished by solvent-free reactions and exposure of water. The mechanochemical reaction of 2 with 1 mol equiv of Him in the solid state gave 5. Complex 5 was also obtained by the mechanochemical reaction of 1 with 2 mol equivalents of Him in the solid state. By placing solid of 5 in water, the solid showed intense photoluminescence to give 2. Complex 1 was produced under vacuum at 185 °C from 2 or 5."

      "\"Designing\" metallic glasses to exhibit properties beyond those offered within the narrow composition ranges where glass formation is possible poses a formidable scientific challenge. This challenge may be tackled by forming composite structures comprising a metallic glass matrix and homogeneously precipitated dendrites, known as \"metallic glass matrix composites\" (MGMCs). In principle, MGMCs can be designed to exploit the attractive performance characteristics of the metallic glass while alleviating its negative undesirable attributes. In this work we introduce a MGMC development concept for designing color in metallic glass. MGMCs consisting of a white-gold metallic glass matrix with finely dispersed yellow-gold microdendrites are explored. A series of gold MGMCs is developed displaying uniform and visually-unresolved yellow colors over a broad range of chromaticity, along with high overall hardness. This design concept paves the way for the development of a new generation of metal alloys that combine advanced engineering performance with attractive cosmetic attributes."
