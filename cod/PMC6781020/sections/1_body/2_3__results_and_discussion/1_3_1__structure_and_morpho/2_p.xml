 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f003">Figure 3</xref>a shows the XRD pattern of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> powder, which was obtained from the dried aqueous solution with SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs. Four main peaks of (110), (101), (211) and (112) were observed, in agreement with the rutile phase of SnO
 <sub>2</sub>. The lattice constants of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> unit cells were evaluated to be 
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> = 4.74677 Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.18196 Å. The crystallite size of the QDs was calculated to be 2.3 nm according to the Scherrer’s formula. The size coincided with the grain size observed from HRTEM, but was smaller than the result of DLS size distribution in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The deviation may be ascribed to the aggregation of QDs, which affected the light scattering during the DLS measurement. The XPS spectrum of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, which shows the presence of C 1s, O 1s and Sn 3d. The high solution pattern of Sn 3d shows two peaks of 487.3 eV and 495.6 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Sn3d
 <sub>5/2</sub>, respectively. The spectrum is in good agreement with the standard pattern from the rutile SnO
 <sub>2</sub> sample [
