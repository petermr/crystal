<p>Another research group has synthesized platinum alloy icosahedral clusters and compared the activity with octahedral ones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These nanoclusters were about 13 nm in size or 
 <italic>N</italic>=20,000 for octahedral clusters and 
 <italic>N</italic>=15,000 for icosahedral clusters. This produces a 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>rel</italic>
 </sub>=30 for the octahedral clusters and 25 for the icosahedral ones. Using the relevant power laws, this gives FE=18.0
 <italic>%</italic> for the octahedral and 19.8% for the icosahedral clusters. There is very little difference in FE for this size of the cluster, but the icosahedral cluster has a significant amount of strain due to twinning, which may shift the d-band center, thus affecting the ORR results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, given the size-dependent data of [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], it may be suggested that smaller clusters would produce still higher ORR data. Indeed, 4 nm Pt
 <sub>3</sub>Ni octahedra, when doped with Mo, have produced record-high ORR results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].
