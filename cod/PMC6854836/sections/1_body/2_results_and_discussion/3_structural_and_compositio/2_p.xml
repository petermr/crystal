 </sup> were based on diffraction data recorded on a Weissenberg camera. Modern single-crystal diffraction methods allow for vastly superior data and also provide tools for the analysis of disordered structures. It is important to note that the refinement of Si–B mixed occupancies from high-resolution data represents a rather accurate composition analysis for single crystals since the form factors for Si and B are sufficiently but not extremely different. For polycrystalline bulk samples, we will show that
