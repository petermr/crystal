<p id="Par6">A compositional analysis was conducted through TEM at both the center and the edge of the bonded Al-Mg material. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a,b)</xref> shows the representative scanning tunnel microscope electron microscopy (STEM) images with the marks describing the examined locations of Spectrums 1–3 at the disk center and Spectrums 4–6 at the disk edge, respectively, and the associated chemical compositions at the measured locations are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectra are also available (Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Widely scattered Mg contents were observed depending on the arbitrarily selected locations. Nevertheless, all locations showed exceptionally high contents of Mg in the Al matrix at room temperature and the detected maximum Mg content was 38.44 at.% which is extremely high by comparison with the solubility limit of Mg of ~1 at.% in Al at room temperature.
