 </sup>, in which only those prepared on the T-STO show interfacial conductivity, the CHO/STO heterointerfaces of both terminations show very high conductivity. Our control experiments demonstrated that the heterointerface of LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub>/S-STO prepared under the same growth condition as CHO/S-STO is highly insulating (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and the CHO/STO heterointerface grown on unterminated STO substrate is still conducting (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These observations confirm that the observed conducting interface of CHO/S-STO is not caused by any incompleteness of the SrO coverage. We also confirm that the STO substrates underwent the same growth condition, but without film growth and post annealing are highly insulating (beyond our measurement limit). Hall effect measurement reveals that for CHO/STO of both terminations, the mobile carriers are electrons (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). With increasing the thickness of CHO,

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. We found that this trend becomes less obvious for the annealed samples (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, d</xref>), suggesting that it is related to the CHO-thickness-dependent amount of oxygen vacancies in STO.
