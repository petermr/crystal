<p>It is noteworthy that our results do not agree with the experimental finding of the electronic properties; in addition, the paramagneticâ€“insulator phase could not be reproduced in the calculations. Ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases are experimentally known to be insulating, and paramagnetic phase is also insulating below room temperature and becomes metallic at higher temperature in conjunction with a structural symmetry change from 
 <italic>Pmma</italic> to 
 <italic>Pmmm</italic>. In fact, one previous density functional study also reported that PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub> is metallic.

 </sup> Thus, it cannot be excluded that the discrepancy may arise from the limit of computational approach in the present work. However, our main aim is to address the oxygen diffusion in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>, and we believe our computational approach provides a better understanding of the microscopic mechanism of oxygen diffusion in the oxide. In practice, the following results in the present work explain well the experimental observations.
