<p>As the field is tilted away from the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis, the low-field MR decreases in magnitude. Despite this decrease however, the peak in the MR actually shifts to a higher field, leading to a cascade of crossing points as displayed in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. As a consequence, the angle at which Δρ peaks (at constant field strength) shifts progressively away from the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis with increasing field (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Comparison of 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> with the ADMR data plotted in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> confirms that the asymmetric MR in LMO arises because of the emergence of a negative component whose magnitude increases as the field is tilted away from a specific “critical angle” θ
 <sub>CR</sub> within the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane. One might argue that a positive component peaking around θ
 <sub>CR</sub> can also lead to the observed asymmetry. As discussed in our previous work (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>), an anisotropic positive MR must arise because of the field-induced one-dimensionalization (i.e., decreased Fermi velocity along the 
 <italic>b</italic> axis and, hence, enhanced scattering rate). Nevertheless, it is expected to preserve the mirror symmetry with respect to crystallographic axes rather than at an intermediate angle like θ
 <sub>CR</sub>. As a result, this anisotropic positive MR, although being important to shape MR curves, cannot account for the observed asymmetry (see section S5 for further discussion of the anisotropic positive MR).
