<p>In most of the parasites examined, an elevated Br X-ray fluorescence signal appears to decorate the parasitic membranes, including the parasitic nucleus. Br also appears to decorate the digestive vacuole but only in BrQ-treated parasites. In order to examine whether it is the membranes that are decorated by Br, a Br distribution image was simulated by virtually placing Br atoms along the 3D positions of the membranes of the digestive vacuole, the nucleus, and the parasite as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>. In order to accomplish this task, we have made a crude estimate of Br membrane coverage by summing the Br atoms along the periphery of the digestive vacuole membrane (seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 
  <italic>A</italic> and 
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>) and dividing this value by measured area of the selected membrane at the corresponding coordinates. This resulted in a Br coverage of 5 Ã— 10
 <sup>3</sup> atoms per square micrometer of the membrane.
