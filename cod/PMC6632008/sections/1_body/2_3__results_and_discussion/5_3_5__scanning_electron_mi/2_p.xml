<p>An important requirement for the most favorable cathode materials is the porosity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f010">Figure 10</xref> shows a good porosity in the surface of the cathode that favors the diffusion and reduction process of the oxygen throughout the bulk of the cathode. Also, the dense electrolyte layer without cracks or fractures is displayed.
