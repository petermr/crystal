<p id="Par20">The CIELAB coordinate 
 <italic>L*</italic>, which quantifies the “luminosity” or “reflectivity” of the alloy, decreases slightly with increasing 
 <italic>x</italic> from 87.43 characterizing the primary-Au (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0) to 82.55 corresponding to the metallic glass (
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0). Likewise, CIELAB coordinate 
 <italic>a*</italic>, which quantifies the “red-green” chromaticity of the alloy, decreases with increasing 
 <italic>x</italic> roughly monotonically from 6.72 corresponding to the primary-Au (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0) to 0.97 characterizing the metallic glass (
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0). But CIELAB coordinate 
 <italic>b*</italic>, which quantifies the “blue-yellow” chromaticity of the alloy, appears to decrease rather broadly with increasing 
 <italic>x</italic>, from 24.96 characterizing the primary-Au (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0) to 7.77 corresponding to the metallic glass (
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0). This demonstrates that by varying 
 <italic>x</italic> from 0 to 1, which amounts to varying the molar (or volume) fraction of the metallic glass phase in the composite from 0% to 100%, one may very effectively control the yellow chromaticity of the MGMC by controlling the CIELAB 
 <italic>b*</italic> coordinate. Plots of CIELAB 
 <italic>L*</italic>, 
 <italic>a*</italic>, and 
 <italic>b</italic>* coordinates vs. 
 <italic>x</italic> are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The roughly linear dependencies suggest that the overall color of the composite follows the rule of mixtures, which further implies that the microstructures of the composites are indeed visually unresolved.
