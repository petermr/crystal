 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f010">Figure 10</xref>c shows the concentration change curves of the degradation process of different initial toluene concentrations over time. When the initial toluene concentration is 105 ppm, the degradation efficiency is higher than the initial concentration at 210 ppm and 315 ppm in the same time. When the degradation efficiency is the same, the degradation time at a high concentration is often longer. However, the degradation amount increases simultaneously with the increase of initial concentration, which may be due to the increased likelihood of contact between the toluene and the catalyst, resulting in more degradation.
