 </sup> where the structure is determined from theory. The later, more accurate, calculations result in a somewhat smaller atomic volume and larger bulk modulus. There is also a relatively small energy gain from the structural optimization (ΔE ~ 1 mRy/atom). At first glance, it appears that this new modeling is worsening the agreement with experiment, but one has to remember that theory predicts zero-temperature values while the measurements are recorded at room temperature
