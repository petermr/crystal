 <caption> (a) Superimposition of the diffraction patterns acquired on the anhydrous phase B (Anh‐B) lamella (colored in black) and in olivine 2, near the lamella (colored in red). The exact locations are shown in (b). A precession angle of 3° has been applied to the electron beam to get quasi‐kinematic conditions. A superstructure can be noted between the [100] ol direction of olivine and the [010] Anh‐B direction of Anh‐B ( 3 × 0.48 nm ≈ 1.43 nm); and a correspondence is observed between the [010] ol direction of olivine and the [001] Anh‐B direction of Anh‐B. (b) Transmission electron microscopy bright‐field corresponding to the acquisition of the diffraction patterns of (a). The interface between the lamella and olivine 2 is edge‐on and located between the arrows. It corresponds to (100) ol plane in olivine and (010) Anh ‐ B in Anh‐B. The circles (250 nm in diameter) represent the position of the selected‐area aperture for acquisition of the diffraction patterns of (a). </caption>
