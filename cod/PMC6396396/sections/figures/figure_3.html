 <caption> Supercell length L (coloured points) and average number of vacancies per vacancy block 〈 N V〉 (solid line) as a function of vacancy concentration x. Points with the same colour correspond to a series of rational values of α with the same numerator. For example, the bottom series of green points corresponds to α = 1/2 (M0), 1/3 (M33) and 1/4 (M50). Supercells that were used in this study are marked and labelled. </caption>
