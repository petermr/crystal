<p>A second way to examine these data is to transform the lattice parameters to a pseudocubic cell corresponding to the cubic perovskite aristotype. In the orthorhombic phase, this pseudocubic cell has two independent cell lengths and one variable angle (with the other two fixed at 90°); in the rhombohedral phase, the pseudocubic cell's three lengths and three angles are, respectively, identical. Analysing the data in this fashion shows by contrast that the pseudocubic cell lengths
