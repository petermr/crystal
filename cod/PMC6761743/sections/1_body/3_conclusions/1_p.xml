<p>In the light of (computational) materials design, there is a need to understand the origins of vacancies in the crystal structures of compounds existing over certain homogeneity ranges because the electronic structure and, ultimately, the physical properties of such a material depend on the particular composition. In this connection, the origins of structural defects have been explored for the examples of rock salt-type sulfide-superconductors, i.e., MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), by means of quantum-chemical techniques. Because the aforementioned sulfides have been reported to exist over certain homogeneity ranges, the vibrational properties, electronic band structures, and nature of bonding were examined for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) as well as M
 <sub>31</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr
 <sub>29</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub>. The crystal structures of the latter sulfides were derived from those of the former sulfides, but comprise fewer metal atoms than the rock salt-type sulfides in accordance with the experimentally determined crystal structures and phase widths.
