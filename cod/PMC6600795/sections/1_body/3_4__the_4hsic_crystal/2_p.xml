<p>To obtain the images analyzed in this paper, two inches wafers were grown by vapor deposition oriented along the plane (0001) within ±0.5° of a SiC crystal. KOH etching at 500 °C or 510 °C was done on the Si (0001) faces of the wafers. Etch pits were observed by using a Nomarski interferometry while X-rays were used for observing the orientation of each pit array.</p>
