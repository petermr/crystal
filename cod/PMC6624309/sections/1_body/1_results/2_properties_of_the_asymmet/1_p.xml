<p id="Par7">At the frequency of degenerated points, these structures exhibit a notably interesting feature of acoustic control. We use an eight-layer cell structure in the x direction, which includes four loss regions and four gain regions, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref>. Here, the regions outside the periodic structure are consistent with the material of the background medium. Incident waves from either the left or right side are perpendicular to the structure. First, we calculate the 2D Hermitian system (α = 0). As depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref>, the reflection (green dotted line) in this system is weak because there is hardly any bandgap in the Γ-X direction in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>. The reflected spectrum is overlapping for the incident acoustic waves from the left or right.
