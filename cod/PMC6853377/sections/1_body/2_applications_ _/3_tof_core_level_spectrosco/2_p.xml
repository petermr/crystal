<p>Core-level spectroscopy is a fingerprint method for the element composition and the chemical state of elements in a compound. The real-space imaging mode allows to precisely locate the analyzed area on the sample. Microspectroscopy is possible with spatial resolution better than the photon footprint by using the size-selectable 
 <italic>field aperture</italic> in the intermediate real image plane [Fig. 2(
 <italic>b</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> â–¸</xref>]. Momentum images of photoelectrons from core levels represent XPD patterns. They carry information on the geometrical structure, complementary to the electronic structure information of the valence-band patterns. Owing to their large cross section in comparison with the valence band, the 
 <italic>k</italic>-distribution of most core levels is recorded in extremely short time: in the present experiments, a few minutes for a pattern with good statistics. Here we discuss the spectroscopic aspect and in Section 3.3
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.3"/> the diffraction aspect.
