<p>Thus, here we report a new material by design, EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>. We report its crystallographically and magnetically ordered structures, determined via single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction. We observe a transition to an A-type antiferromagnetic state (alternating-orientation ferromagnetic layers) near 30 K, and below that temperature significant magnetoresistance, a type-II nodal-line semimetal when spin–orbit coupling is ignored. Electronic structure calculations reveal that EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> is an antiferromagnetic topological insulator when Hubbard (
 <italic>U</italic>) is included. The detailed interplay of unconventional electronic states (“band inversion”), spin–orbit coupling, and the surface states is presented theoretically. The presence of the surface states is confirmed by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our new quantum material is easily grown as bulk crystals, displays magnetic ordering at accessible temperatures, and displays topological surface states, thus allowing the interactions of ferromagnetism and topological surface states to be observed in a bulk material with a simple crystal structure.
