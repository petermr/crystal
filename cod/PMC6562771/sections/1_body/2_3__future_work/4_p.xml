<p>Thirdly, in the current findings, researchers focused on the various kinds of influencing factors and further integrated them into the surface topography model. In fact, the final surface topography can be regarded as the comprehensive results of these influencing factors. When the impact of one influencing factor is superior to others, corresponding results will be reflected in the machined surface topography. Hence, to inversely infer the dominant influencing factors based on the results of surface topography acquired in experiment should also be given enough attention. </p>
