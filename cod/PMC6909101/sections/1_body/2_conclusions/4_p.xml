<p id="p0790">Since according to the Franck-Condon principle, the same oscillator behaves in the same elementary molecular act both as a quantum system (near the turning points of the nuclei) and as a classical system (near the bottom of the potential well for the nuclei), then the Franck-Condon principle is essentially one of the most important prerequisites for the creation of quantum-classical mechanics (see Sections 
 <xref rid="sec2.1" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="sec2.5" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref>), the simplest implementation of which is demonstrated in this article.
