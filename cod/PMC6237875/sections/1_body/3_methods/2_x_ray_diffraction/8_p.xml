 </sup>. Indexing of the unit cell was performed on about 50 reflections manually selected in the reciprocal space viewer (Ewald explorer implemented in CrysAlisPro software). The reflections were selected in order to follow a 3D lattice in the reciprocal space. Then the found unit cell was refined on the whole set of the reflections with 0.05 tolerance (maximum allowed displacement of the
