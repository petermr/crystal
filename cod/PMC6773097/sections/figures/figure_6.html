 <caption> Schematic representation of the framework structure of SSZ‐27 along the y‐axis showing the arrangement of the heart‐shaped and 42T cavities in the xz‐plane. The structure can be described in terms of layers that stack along the y‐axis, where pink depicts the y=0.50±0.25 layer and blue the y=1.00±0.25 layer. The layers are connected via 8‐rings that connect each 42T cavity with 4 heart‐shaped cavities in the adjacent layers, forming 1D channels running parallel to the y‐axis. O atoms are omitted for clarity. </caption>
