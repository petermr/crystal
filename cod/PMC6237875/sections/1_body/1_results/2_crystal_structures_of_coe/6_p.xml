<p id="Par13">In coordinated structures, the occurrence of polyhedra sharing edges or faces is only common for large cations, but very rarely seen for high-valence and low-coordinated (with the coordination number six or lower) small cations. This is the main thrust of third Pauling’s rule
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, which is especially strict for compounds such as borates, phosphates, and silicates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Coesite-IV and coesite-V represent the first experimental examples of violation of third Pauling’s rule for SiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra linked through faces. In fact, structures of coesite-IV and coesite-V do not obey also fifth Pauling’s rule (“the rule of parsimony”)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. This rule suggests that the number of essentially different kinds of constituents forming a crystal structure tends to be small. Although silicates provide many exceptions from the rule (e.g., the structure of MgSiO
 <sub>3</sub> garnet features both silicon tetrahedra and octahedra), all hitherto-known silica polymorphs

 </sup> (at least 30 different phases) are built either of tetrahedra or octahedra solely. Thus, coesite-IV and coesite-V are the first experimentally observed silica polymorphs built of polyhedra of different types.
