<p>The phonon spectra were computed using the finite-displacement method as implemented in the PHONOPY code [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The atomic forces were calculated using a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell and a 1 × 2 × 2 k-point grid. The other computational parameters were the same as those of the aforementioned bulk calculations.
