   <sub>1</sub>-arsenic crystals form as bladed crystals, which show parallel growth along the b-axis. Poor growth in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis results in a thin plate shape. Because periodicity is short in the b-axis direction,

   <sub>1</sub>-arsenic crystals tends to elongate in this direction, and the crystals assume a bladed shape.
