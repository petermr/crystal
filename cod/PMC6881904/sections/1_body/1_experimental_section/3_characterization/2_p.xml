<p>Steady photoluminescence and excitation spectra were determined via single photon counting technique on a FSP920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK) equipped with a 450 W xenon (Xe) lamp, TMS300 monochromators, and thermo-electronic cooled Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. Time-resolved spectra were measured by time-correlated single photon counting technique on the FSP920 system with pulsed excitation sources of a microsecond μF900 Xe lamp. To eliminate signal noise from excitation sources, long-pass filters of 400, 490, 695, and 710 nm were appropriately applied in the front of detectors. Temperature-dependent fluorescence spectra of Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>: 60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> were measured by using a Fluorolog-3 spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with a FL-1073 PMT detector and a SPEX DM302 P.C. Acq. module. The phosphors were heated on an external hot plate, and each temperature point was allowed to equilibrate as monitored by a thermocouple in a sand bath adjacent to the phosphors. Once the temperature was equilibrated, the emission spectrum of the hot sample was measured (λ
 <sub>ex</sub> = 450 nm) and compared to a room temperature sample of the phosphor to eliminate the impact of lamp intensity fluctuations. For comparison, all optical measurements were rigorously performed under identical conditions for each series of testing.
