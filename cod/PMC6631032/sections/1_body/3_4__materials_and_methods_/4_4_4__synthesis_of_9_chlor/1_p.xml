<p>Lumichrome 50 mg (0.207 mmol), 
 <italic>N</italic>-chlorosuccinimide 55 mg (0.412 mmol) and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> anhydrous 3 mg (0.019 mmol) dissolved in DMF (10 mL) were stirred at rt for 5 days. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, with a 10% step gradient from CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> to MeOH, affording in fraction 1, 9-chlorolumichrome (23 mg, 0.098 mmol, 47% yield).
