 <p id="Par1">“Designing” metallic glasses to exhibit properties beyond those offered within the narrow composition ranges where glass formation is possible poses a formidable scientific challenge. This challenge may be tackled by forming composite structures comprising a metallic glass matrix and homogeneously precipitated dendrites, known as “metallic glass matrix composites” (MGMCs). In principle, MGMCs can be designed to exploit the attractive performance characteristics of the metallic glass while alleviating its negative undesirable attributes. In this work we introduce a MGMC development concept for designing color in metallic glass. MGMCs consisting of a white-gold metallic glass matrix with finely dispersed yellow-gold microdendrites are explored. A series of gold MGMCs is developed displaying uniform and visually-unresolved yellow colors over a broad range of chromaticity, along with high overall hardness. This design concept paves the way for the development of a new generation of metal alloys that combine advanced engineering performance with attractive cosmetic attributes.</p>
