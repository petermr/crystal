<p id="Par26">It should be noted that only six measurements resulted in successful structure solution and satisfactory refinement (one for coesite-III, four for coesite-IV, and one for coesite-V). The reasons are close peaks overlapping since the samples often contained two phases, early sample deterioration under compression which resulted in peak broadening and low intensity of the reflections.</p>
