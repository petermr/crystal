 <caption> Electrostatic potentials in Ni(OEP) and YSc 2N@C 80 molecules (red and blue indicate more negative and positive potentials, respectively) mapped on the electron density isosurface of 0.01 a.u. YSc 2N@C 80 is shown in three orientations: normal to the YSc 2N plane and along the Sc–N and Y–N bonds. </caption>
