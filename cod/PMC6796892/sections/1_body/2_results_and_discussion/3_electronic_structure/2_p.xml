<p>The total DOS for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.33, 0.50, and 0.67 compositions were calculated with the GGA + 
 <italic>U</italic> method, as shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01176/suppl_file/ao9b01176_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S3</ext-link> in the Supporting Information. The band gap value decreases with increase in 
 <italic>x</italic>. As it is known that the bond lengths and lattice parameters have direct impact on band gaps, the decreasing band gap may be attributed to the increase in the average Ti/V–O bond length with 
 <italic>x</italic> in Ti/V–O
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedra. (The average Ti–O bond length is 2.07 Å in PTO, whereas the V–O bond length is 2.11 Å in the case of PVO.) The lattice parameter 
 <italic>c</italic> also increases with 
 <italic>x</italic>.
