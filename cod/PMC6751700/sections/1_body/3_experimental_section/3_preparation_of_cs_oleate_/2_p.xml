 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (1.25 mmol), ODE (20.0 mL), and OA (1.3 mL) were mixed and degassed for 1 h at 120 °C and then purged with Ar gas. A Cs-oleate precursor solution was obtained by heating the mixture to 150 °C. The resulting solution was preheated at 100 °C before being injected into the reaction flask.
