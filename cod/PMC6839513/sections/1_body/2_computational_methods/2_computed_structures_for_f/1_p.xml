<p>Among the many fully converged structures of crystalline phenytoin, possible candidate structures for 
 <bold>forms I</bold> and 
 <bold>II</bold> (bulk and SIP, respectively) were identified by matching computed and experimental lattice parameters and then further screened by comparing computed and experimental GIXD patterns. Since these structures were optimized within space group constraints, we must also verify that they are 
 <italic>local</italic> minima of the potential energy surface, i.e., that their energy does not decrease on lowering the symmetry.
