<p id="Par12">Here, the droplets are chiral, and the spiral organization of the molecules in a droplet is specifically associated with the formation of spiral disclination lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The molecules are disorganized in these defect lines, and the viscosity is thus lower compared with the interfacial areas where the molecules are oriented homeotropically

 </sup>—in other words the Marangoni flow is faster along the spiral disclination lines. As the entire system of bulk fluid and droplet is torque free, the internal flow consequently rotates, and then the droplet itself spins along a helical trajectory that is characterized by a pitch P and radius R (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, and Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Overall, the Marangoni flow thus couples to the chiral variation of the director via the viscosity
