 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref> shows a survey ToF spectrum of a GaInMnAs sample taken at a photon energy of 3.000 keV. The spectrum shows all outer core levels of the constituents, including the weak signals from indium (3%) and manganese (2.5%) as well as residual carbon and oxygen on the (unprepared) surface. For such a ToF survey spectrum (here 550 eV wide) taken in a single exposure with fixed setting of all lens voltages, the drift energy spans a large range.
