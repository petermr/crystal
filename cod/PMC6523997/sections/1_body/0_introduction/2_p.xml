<p>The chemical landscape of perovskites for solar cells is limited to basically eight main components: methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), and cesium (Cs) as monovalent cations, Pb(II) and Sn(II) as divalent species and chloride, bromide, and iodide as anions. The intrinsic properties of MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> and FAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> prohibit their use as pure materials for industrial applications such as solar cells, as they do not have suitable chemical stability due to their phase behavior.

 </sup> MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> displays a cubic to tetragonal phase transition at approximately 57 °C, and slowly turns white (MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O) or yellow (MA
 <sub>4</sub>PbI
 <sub>6</sub>·2H
 <sub>2</sub>O) when exposed to a humid atmosphere. The FAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> cubic black α-phase interconverts to the nonperovskite, hexagonal yellow δ-phase in a couple of weeks in dry air at RT.
