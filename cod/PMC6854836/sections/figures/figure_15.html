 <caption> Raman spectra of α-B 12, B 6P, α-SiB 3– x , and β-SiB 3 single crystals (from top to bottom). The α-B 12, α-SiB 3– x , and β-SiB 3 spectra were recorded from samples prepared for this work, whereas the spectrum of B 6P was provided by Reshetniak and corresponds to that described in ref ( 93). For α-B 12 and B 6P, the symmetry of the modes is indicated. The arrows indicate the relation of modes in the spectra of α-B 12 and B 6P, and B 6P and α-SiB 3– x . The horizontal dotted line marks the location of the libration mode in the spectra of α-B 12, B 6P, and α-SiB 3– x . The bars underneath the spectrum of β-SiB 3 correspond to DFT calculated Raman modes for β-SiB 3. The asterisks in the β-SiB 3 spectrum mark possibly spurious peaks. The asterisks in the α-B 12 spectrum mark bands due to luminescence and/or 10B/ 11B isotope effects. 86 </caption>
