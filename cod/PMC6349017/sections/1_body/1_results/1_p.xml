<p>The ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surfaces are mixed-terminated, meaning that they expose an equal amount of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and O
 <sup>2–</sup> ions in the outermost surface layer. As compared to the atoms in the bulk, the atoms in the surface layer have each lost one of their four nearest neighbors. For ZnO(101[combining macron]0), only one of the remaining three nearest neighbors is in the surface layer (the remaining two are in the subsurface layer), whereas for ZnO(112[combining macron]0), two of the nearest neighbors are in the surface layer (and one in the subsurface layer). Thus, the ZnO(101[combining macron]0) surface consists of an array of isolated Zn–O “surface dimers” in which two surface Zn atoms are only connected 
 <italic>via</italic> a nearest neighbor O in the subsurface layer. On the contrary, the ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surface consists of extended zig-zagged “surface rows” that consist of nearest-neighbors within in the surface layer; these surface rows extend along the polar ±[0001] directions. The rows are separated by trenches and connected by atoms in the subsurface layer.
