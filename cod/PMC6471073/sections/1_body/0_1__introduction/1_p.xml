<p>Gyroscopes are used to measure the rate of rotation (rate gyroscopes) or the angles of turn (angle gyroscopes), and various microgyroscopes have been reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B2-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among them, the micromachined disk resonator gyroscope (DRG) working on the degenerate modes attracted much attention for its advantages of intrinsic mode matching, high quantity factor, high shock resistance, and less sensitivity to environment vibrations [

 <xref rid="B9-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The degenerate modes include driving mode and sensing mode which ideally occur at the same frequency but have indistinguishable mode shapes. Generally, the in-plane fundamental (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) flexural modes, also known as the wineglass mode, are utilized for rotating rate measurement in the DRG [
 <xref rid="B10-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For the vibratory gyroscope in vibrating mode, the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes are the most fundamental and important parameters. Calculation of the other performances of the gyroscope, such as effective mass, effective stiffness, mechanical sensitivity, quality factor, resolution, and others, are all based on the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes [
