<p>In general, one can produce 50–100 mg of fibers during a single electrospinning process. Since one color conversion layer contains between 20 and 30 mg of PVP/N-CDot fibers, it is possible to fabricate more than three or four individual color conversion layers using the fibers obtained from one single electrospinning process. In contrast, only a single layer is obtained at a time via the drop-casting approach. Furthermore, instead of directly varying the amount of N-CDots (µL) contained in the color conversion layers, as it was done in the previous measurements, one can adjust the properties of the generated white light by tuning the amount of fibers in terms of their mass (m). More precisely, since the PVP/N-CDot fibers were fabricated using a fixed amount of N-CDots (15 µL), one can indirectly adjust the percentage of N-CDots in the color conversion layers by varying the amount of fibers employed for its production, for instance, the total amount of N-CDots (15 µL) is reached if one uses all of the produced fibers at once.</p>
