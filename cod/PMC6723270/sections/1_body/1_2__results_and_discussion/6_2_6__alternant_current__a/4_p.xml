 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the AC conductivity for each material, by around two orders of magnitude, along with the induced temperature of the experiment. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f007">Figure 7</xref>a, a low-frequency dispersion (LFD) can be seen for all temperatures. The region II (between 10 Hz up to 1 MHz) is dominated by DC conductivity, and region III (after 1 MHz) is characterized by the “universal Jonscher law” [
 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The results suggest that the charge transport mechanism is temperature-activated. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows the activation energy of each material. It is evident that, for Mn4 material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f008">Figure 8</xref>a), the conductivity depends on the frequency and temperature. However, for Mn8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f008">Figure 8</xref>b), at temperatures higher than 348 K and frequencies below 10 MHz, the dependence is mainly associated with the temperature. The conductivity results suggest that the process is dominated by thermally activated “electron hopping” in the range of analyzed temperatures. When the electrons move forward between Mn sites, there is a change in the local structure caused by the change in the oxidation state of the MnO
 <sub>6</sub> units that form the layer. These changes generate lattice vibrations. This phenomenon should be understood as a strong electron–phonon interaction or polaron mechanism [
 <xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], which is the other one present in the electrical conductivity process. The activation energies of each material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f008">Figure 8</xref>) were lower than those reported for similar materials [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is because of the higher average oxidation state of manganese (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which means a higher amount of Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>, as is reported for manganites obtained from a nickel permanganate precursor [
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The lower activation energy of Mn4 compared to Mn6 and Mn8 could be associated with the difference in the quantity of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> between the synthesized materials, the variation of the Mn–O–Mn bond lengths resulting from crystal symmetry (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the changes of the surface area that can lead to a redistribution of electron charge [
 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], “polaron hopping” [
 <xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> ions [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; thus, there are different electric behaviors with respect to the frequency of the applied electric field. Presumably, the increase of the conductivity involved in the transition zone, between Region I and Region II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f008">Figure 8</xref>), was due to the release of physiosorbed water on the material’s surface [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
