<p>In this letter, we focus on the interface formed between water and the reportedly more photocatalytically active rutile-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011) surface. We have previously determined the quantitative structure of the clean substrate, which exhibits a (2 × 1) reconstruction, in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) by means of surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD),
