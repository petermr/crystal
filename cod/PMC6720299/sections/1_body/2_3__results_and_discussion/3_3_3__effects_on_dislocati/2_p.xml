<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, the dislocation density gradually increased under the stress level of 1.5 GPa and 2.0 GPa. At a 2.5 GPa stress level, it increased at first and then decreased until reaching zero. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, the dislocation density gradually increased under the stress level of 1.5 GPa and 2.0 GPa while the dislocation densities at 2.5 GPa reduced gradually to zero. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref>c, the dislocation density gradually increased under the stress level of 1.5 GPa and then decreased a little, while the dislocation densities at 2.0 and 2.5 GPa reduced gradually to zero. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref>d, the dislocation densities increased gradually under the stress levels of 1.5 GPa and then reduced to the initial value. At a 2.5 GPa stress level, the value increased at first and then decreased until reaching zero, while the dislocation densities at 2.5 GPa reduced gradually to zero. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref>e,f, the dislocation densities gradually reduced zero under all stress levels.
