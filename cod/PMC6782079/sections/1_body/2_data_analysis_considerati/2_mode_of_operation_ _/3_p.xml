<p>Although extreme 
 <italic>Q</italic> is theoretically achievable, the count rates at very high and very low 
 <italic>Q</italic> are negligible because of the guide design (see Fig. 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref>). Also, these ranges are valid for the sample changer where there is no physical obstruction from the device and may not be achievable for all sample environments. In Figs. 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>a</italic>) and 4(
 <italic>b</italic>), data sets for the four standard wavelength settings from a sample that has a long 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing peak (CsLaNb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>) are shown. A zoomed-in region of the data clearly shows how resolution and intensities can vary from data collected for the same amount of time.
