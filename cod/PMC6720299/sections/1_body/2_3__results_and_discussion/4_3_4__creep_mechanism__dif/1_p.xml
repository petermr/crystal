<p>From the above analysis, the dislocation disappeared during the creep deformation process, especially when the steady-state creep phase was completed. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the MSD curves of nanocrystalline NiAl models. By comparing the MSD curves to their corresponding creep curves, it was found that the diffusion trends of atoms in the nanocrystalline NiAl were almost similar to the creep process. The results of MD simulation demonstrated that the creep deformation of nanocrystalline NiAl was significantly controlled by atomic diffusion. This is mainly due to the fact that the diffusion rate of atoms increases with decreasing grain size and increasing temperature and stress levels.
