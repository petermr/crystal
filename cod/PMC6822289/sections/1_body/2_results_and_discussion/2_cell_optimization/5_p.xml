<p>To evaluate for the entire COF database the relative importance of the two cell optimization stages, we plotted in the histograms of 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref> the difference in energy in the first cell optimization (with constrained angles) and the further drop in the energy for the final cell optimization, showing also the contribution of dispersion interactions. This last is intended as the change in the energy due to the DFT-D3(BJ) terms only.
