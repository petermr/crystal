<p id="Par16">The values of 
 <italic>α</italic> are minimal near the centers of 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs and increase gradually toward their boundaries. The magnitude of the Pb displacements scales inversely with 
 <italic>α</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Overall this picture agrees with the results of the recent MD studies

 </sup>, which suggested a high incidence of domain walls without a disordered matrix. Projections of the Pb-displacement field onto the {110} planes also agree with the displacement patterns identified in the recently published STEM images

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> (inset) illustrates smooth variation of the displacement magnitude across the 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNR boundary. Our refinements at 200 K, which is below the freezing temperature 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>f</sub>≈230 K, reveal significant growth of the 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs with a concurrent increase in the magnitudes of the Pb displacements (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). This observation agrees with the previously reported experimental and modeling data on the temperature behavior of PMN. Also, the estimated sizes of 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs are comparable with the correlation lengths identified in earlier studies using parameterized fits of variable-temperature neutron PDFs
