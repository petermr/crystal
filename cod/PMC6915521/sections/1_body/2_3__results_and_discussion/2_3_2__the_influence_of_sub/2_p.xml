<p>A nanoscale sliding contact model with subsurface defects is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f016">Figure 16</xref>. Three nanoscale ball defects are modeled, and the depth of the defect is represented by the distance 
 <italic>h</italic> between the center of ball defect and surface. Five different locations are used to study the effects of defect position on friction behaviors, and the depths are 
 <italic>h</italic> = 0.90375 nm, 3.615 nm, 7.23 nm, 9.94125 nm, and 12.6525 nm. To accommodate the defects, the dimensions of the substrate are 21.69 nm × 5.784 nm × 14.46 nm in 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic> and 
 <italic>z</italic> directions, respectively. The distance between adjacent balls in x direction is 5.4225 nm, and the radius of the ball defect is 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.723 nm. In 
 <italic>y</italic> direction, the ball defects are located in the center of the model.
