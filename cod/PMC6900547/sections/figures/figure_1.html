 <caption> (a) Raman spectrum of carbonate symmetrical stretching band with shoulder at higher wavenumbers taken from a water solution equilibrated with zabuyelite at room temperature. (b) Change with temperature of area under Raman bands that are related to tetrahedral structure ( A tet) and H-bonding ( A H-bond) of water in different solutions. I indicates the ionic strength of the different solutions. </caption>
