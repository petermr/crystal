<p id="p0105">Thus, the generally accepted theory of molecular quantum transitions has a long history based on the well-known classical works of Born and Oppenheimer [

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which appeared immediately after the development of the foundations of quantum mechanics. Born and Oppenheimer were the first to solve the quantum-mechanical problem for a system of coupled electrons and nuclei in the simplest case for molecules [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], offering an effective and successful physical and mathematical technique, later called adiabatic approximation. Adiabatic approximation originated from adiabatic invariants, which were previously formulated by Ehrenfest [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The effectiveness of adiabatic approximation results from the Born-Oppenheimer theory of a significant difference in the masses of electrons and nuclei, which enables the separation of the slow motion of very heavy nuclei from the rapid motion of light electrons by neglecting the small nonadiabaticity operator in the Schr√∂dinger equation to solve quantum-mechanical problems. The Born-Oppenheimer theory [
