<p id="Par3">White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been successfully used in solid-state lighting or backlight units for liquid crystal displays due to their high efficiency, tunable color, durability, long lifetime, energy saving, and environmental friendliness

 </sup>. However, there is still a challenge in enhanced color rendition because of the cyan gap between blue and yellow emission in the 470–500 nm region, which is not suitable for high-quality general lighting. Hence, it is of fundamental importance to develop a novel phosphor emitting in this spectral region for filling the valley between the blue and yellow emission peaks in a white LED device. Accordingly, the development of narrow-band cyan-emitting phosphors excited by blue light with a small Stokes shift is necessary for improving the optical performance of pc-LEDs
