<p>1 g of PDMS (composed of a silicon elastomer and curing agent with 10:1 ratio) was prepared in a glass vial. Then, a fixed amount (70.0 mg) of yellow YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor was added into the glass vial. In order to investigate the effect of the red phosphor amount on the resulting white light properties, a desired amount of the red Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> sub-micrometer phosphor in mass was introduced into the PDMS/YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>. The resulting mixture was stirred until all phosphors mixed homogenously. Then, this mixture was dropped into a mold having a fixed thickness of 0.2 cm and a diameter of 2.0 cm and the mold was put into a vacuum oven for 30 min for solvent evaporation. Finally, this mold was cured and cross-linked at 100 Â°C for 30 min and then the free-standing composite film was removed from the mold.
