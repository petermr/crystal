 <p>Layered CaTaN
  <sub>2</sub> and MgTa
  <sub>2</sub>N
  <sub>3</sub> and cubic Mg
  <sub>2</sub>Ta
  <sub>2</sub>N
  <sub>4</sub> were prepared by direct solid state reaction from the binary nitrides Ta
  <sub>3</sub>N
  <sub>5</sub> and A
  <sub>3</sub>N
  <sub>2</sub> (A: Mg, Ca). CaTaN
  <sub>2</sub> showed a slight Ca deficiency (0.11 moles per formula), and a monoclinic distortion from previously reported 
  <italic>R</italic>3̅
  <italic>m</italic> symmetry, with space group 
  <italic>C</italic>2/
  <italic>m</italic> and cell parameters 
  <italic>a</italic> = 5.4011(2), 
  <italic>b</italic> = 3.1434(1), 
  <italic>c</italic> = 5.9464(2) Å and β = 107.91(3)°. Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
  <sup>2+</sup> deintercalation was investigated in the three compounds both chemically and electrochemically. No significant Mg
  <sup>2+</sup> extraction could be inferred for MgTa
  <sub>2</sub>N
  <sub>3</sub> and Mg
  <sub>2</sub>Ta
  <sub>2</sub>N
  <sub>4</sub>, neither after reaction with NO
  <sub>2</sub>BF
  <sub>4</sub> nor after electrochemical oxidation at 100 °C in alkyl carbonate electrolytes. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of chemically oxidized Ca
  <sub>0.89</sub>TaN
  <sub>2</sub> indicates a decrease of the Ca content to 0.34 concomitant to the disappearance of the monoclinic distortion and expansion of the interlayer space from 5.658 to 5.762 Å, space group 
  <italic>R</italic>3̅
  <italic>m</italic> and cell parameters 
  <italic>a</italic> = 3.1103(1) and 
  <italic>c</italic> = 17.287(1) Å. Deintercalation in this compound was also achieved electrochemically at 100 °C. Results of density functional theory calculations seem to indicate that reaction mechanisms for CaTaN
  <sub>2</sub> oxidation additional and/or alternative to deintercalation are taking place, which is likely related to the loss of crystallinity observed upon oxidation and the irreversibility of the process.
