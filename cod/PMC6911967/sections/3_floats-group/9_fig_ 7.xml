 <caption>
  <p>(a) UBB model of the (110)-
   <italic>c</italic>(8 × 10) silicon and germanium surfaces. The atoms of the first and second (110) layers are marked in blue and green, respectively. Additional atoms and atoms strongly shifted from their ideal lattice positions are marked in red. (b)–(e) Calculated constant-current STM images using the model, shown in (a), and assuming a silicon surface. (b), (d) 
   <italic>U</italic> = +1.0 V. (c), (e) 
   <italic>U</italic> = −1.0 V. The unit cell is outlined in (a), (b) and (c). The image size in (d), (e) is 150 × 150 Å
