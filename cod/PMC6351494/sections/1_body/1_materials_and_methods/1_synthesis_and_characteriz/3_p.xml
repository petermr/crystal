<p>The synthesized powders and the thin films were characterized using X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) equipped with Cu-KÎ± radiation. The sample preparation was carried out in the argon-filled glove box &lt; 1.0 ppm of moisture and oxygen, using an airtight sample holder to avoid the air exposure of the samples during the measurement. The structural refinement for the powder samples was carried out using RIERAN-FP ver. 2.84 (Izumi and Momma, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and the crystal structures were drawn by VESTA 3.4.4 (Momma and Izumi, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We also performed the BVS mapping to visualize the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ion diffusion pathways, using PyAbstantia ver. 0.7 (Nishimura, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
