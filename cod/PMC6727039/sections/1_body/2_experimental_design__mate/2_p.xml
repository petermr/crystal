<p id="p0045">All reactions were carried out under an inert nitrogen atmosphere with anhydrous solvents. Reagents were purchased and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) carried out on Merck silica gel plates (60F-254; 0.25 mm) by using UV light as the visualizing agent and an acidic mixture of anisaldehyde, phosphomolybdic acid, ceric ammonium molybdate, or basic aqueous potassium permanganate (KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>) and heat as developing agents. Merck silica gel (60, particle size 0.043–0.063 mm) was used for flash column chromatography. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Av-500 and Av-300 instruments and calibrated by using residual undeuterated solvent as an internal reference (CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>: δ = 7.26 (
 <sup>1</sup>H), 77.16 ppm (
 <sup>13</sup>C)). Coupling constant in hertz (Hz). Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) for 
 <bold>18a</bold> and 
 <bold>19a</bold> were collected on a Bruker SMART diffractometer equipped with an Apex II area detector using Mo-Kα radiation from a fine-focus sealed source tube with a focusing collimator (Bruker Nano, Inc., Madison, WI). SCXRD data for 
 <bold>24</bold> was collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer equipped with a Photon 100 CMOS area detector using Mo-Kα radiation from a microfocus source (Bruker Nano). For all crystals, hemispheres of data were collected using strategies of scans about the omega and phi axes with frame widths of 0.5°. Data collection, unit cell determination, data reduction, absorption correction, and scaling were performed using the Bruker Apex3 software suite: Apex3, AXScale and SAINT, version 2017.3–0; Bruker AXS Inc.: Madison, WI, 2017. Enantiomeric excess was determined by HPLC (Lux® 5 μm Amylose-1, i-PrOH/hexane = 1/9, 0.5ml/min, 220nm).
