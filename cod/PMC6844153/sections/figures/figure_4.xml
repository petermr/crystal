  <p>Views of V
   <sub>2</sub>Se
   <sub>9</sub> single-lattice cells, which are rotated from the reference structure to direct the length of the chains to the [1 0 0] axis. (a) Two V
   <sub>4</sub>Se
   <sub>18</sub> chain units are shown, consisting of V
   <sub>2</sub>Se
   <sub>4</sub> octahedrons and Se
   <sub>5</sub> connecting the octahedrons. The numbering of selenium and vanadium ions follows those of the reference.

   </sup> An inclined view (b) and projected view (c) to the plane perpendicular to the length of chains are shown. A single cell has four chains. Two chains are stacked in the bottom of the unit cell as the first layer, and two chains are stacked on the top of the unit cell as the second layer. Two layers are shifted by a half-length between chains in each layer.
