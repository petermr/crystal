At low temperature (~27 K), the system undergoes another magnetic transition, where weak ferromagnetism predicted by Goodenough-Kanamori rule could be identified. As lattice parameter decreases with Ca doping, the reduced Ni-O-Re bond angle introduces nonzero overlap integral between Ni

 <italic>b</italic>-axis. The neutron powder diffraction measurement conducted at room temperature and low temperature (2 K) revealed that the 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 sample possesses a disordered/short-range magnetic state at low temperature, while for Ca sample, the Ni and Re sublattices aligned ferrimagnetically to give a long range magnetic order evidenced from the magnetic Bragg peak corresponding to the double perovskite superlattice peak.
