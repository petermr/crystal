<p id="Par29">AFM calculations were performed assuming that two Mn ions in the unit cell have opposite magnetization directions, i.e., without increasing the structural unit cell. For both compounds this results in checkerboard AFM order in ab plane. Magnetic order along 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis is, however, FM for YbMnB
 <sub>2</sub> (P4/nmm) structure and AFM for EuMnB
 <sub>2</sub> (I4/mmm).
