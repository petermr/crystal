  <p>For the CPFE data: (
   <bold>a</bold>) Slices 1–3 drawn on the block represent the three sections along the X-axis (slice 2 being at the indent centre) on which the residual deviatoric elastic strains predicted by CPFE are shown in (
   <bold>c</bold>) unimplanted sample and in (
   <bold>d</bold>) helium-implanted sample. For the Laue data (Laue measurements in
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
   </sup>): (
   <bold>b</bold>) Visualisation of the measured sample volume. Superimposed are the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as the slices on which the measured deviatoric elastic lattice strains in (
   <bold>c</bold>) the unimplanted sample and (
   <bold>d</bold>) the helium-implanted sample are plotted. With respect to the initial crystallographic coordinates, X is [1 −1 0] direction, Y is [1 1 0] and Z is [001]. Slices 1–3 in experiments and simulations are at the same spatial positions and data in (
   <bold>c</bold>) and (
   <bold>d</bold>) is displayed on the same length- and colour-scales. The dotted white lines through (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>) represent the depth at which the line plots in Figure C.1 in the Supplementary Material were extracted.
