<p>A major challenge in the perovskite field is to obtain uniform, continuous, and reproducible films by spin-coating deposition with the use of antisolvents. A large number of pinholes are generated during the film formation, and long optimization processes dependent on substrates, precursor solutions, and deposition conditions are necessary before obtaining appreciable results. In recent years, many works were focused on finding tricks to circumvent this issue, and most of the time, chloride-based additives

As the deposition occurs under ambient conditions without control of parameters as temperature, humidity, or air-flow, it was necessary finding a straightforward method to obtain reproducible and pinhole-free layers.
