 <caption> X-ray scattering data for magnetite. a Scattering intensities S( Q) for magnetite at three representative temperatures. b Pair distribution functions G( r) derived from S( Q) data in a. Typical thermal effects leading to loss of high- Q features in S( Q) and broadening of G( r) peaks are observed </caption>
