 <caption> Resonators vs. perovskite material’s morphology. WGM: ( a, c, d) lasing spectra of the CsPbBr 3 microcuboids of different size, the insets are corresponding SEM images of the samples; ( b) numerical simulations on the standing wave field distributions, which are confined in the square cross-section of cube with size of 1.7 µm. Reproduced with permission [ 96]. Copyright American Chemical Society, 2019. Array of WGM resonators: ( e) Scheme of microlasers array fabrication, false-color SEM image, and a photo of a 1 × 1 cm 2 array; ( f) lasing spectra from perovskite microlasers from MAPbI 3 (brown curve), MAPbBrI 2 (red curve), and MAPbBr 3 (green curve), the insets are PL images of the samples.

RL: ( g) Optical images of the (BA) 2PbI 4 (n = 1) single crystal bottom and top surface; ( h) lasing spectra from high-quality homologous 2D perovskite single crystals with n = 1, 2, 3. Reproduced with permission [ 111]. Copyright American Chemical Society, 2018. ( i) Scheme of a fabrication CsPbBr 3 QD-embedded glass (QDs@glass) via in-situ crystallization; ( k) up-conversion PL spectra of QDs@glass vs. the pump power of 800 nm laser, the inset is a photo of sample excited with energy density above threshold; ( l) PL intensity vs. pump energy density.
