<p>We have developed an all-atom FF for LLM-105 compounds. As a remarkable energetic crystal, its fundamental properties have been focused on using several ab initio methods but the FF. Considering the compatibility of the force filed, a modified Amber function form was chosen for describing the interaction in LLM-105, in which the BHK vdW potential is used instead of the LJ potential. The electrostatic energy was represented with the interaction among the RESP charges, and vdW parameters were fitted using the potential energies of more than 1000 dimers estimated at the PBE0/aug-cc-pVDZ level with the XDM dispersion correction. Then, the bonding parameters were fitted from a series of perturbation structures based on the equilibrium structure in the gas phase.</p>
