<p>Twinning superlattices (TSLs)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,

 </sup> are a limiting case of these crystal phase superstructures, where the only polytype present exhibits a periodic 60° rotation of the crystal lattice. This is a unique metamaterial which locally is constituted by one single crystal phase but has the overall symmetry of a different one and that in III–V compounds has been obtained only with NWs. It is worth noting, however, that since their discovery

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
 </sup> none of the functional properties of TSLs has been reported so far. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations of TSL in Si NWs have exposed the possibility to tune the thermal conductivity in these systems by changing the distance between twin planes, namely the period of the superlattice.

 </sup> In our report, we provide experimental evidence, corroborated and rationalized by ab initio calculations, of such modified properties and of their tunability.
