 </sup>. This version makes extensive use of GPU computing (yet unavailable for the distribution package of RMCProfile), which is critical for achieving computational speeds required to handle large atomic configurations and calculations of 3D diffuse scattering involved in this study. The PMN structure was modeled using atomic configurations of 40 × 40 × 40 unit cells, which included 320,000 atoms (Mg/Nb ratio is equal to 0.49998828) and covered interatomic distances up to 8 nm. Neutron- and X-ray total-scattering data in both real and reciprocal spaces were fitted simultaneously with the two EXAFS data sets and the 3D X-ray single-crystal diffuse-intensity distribution; in addition, the neutron Bragg profile was included in the fit. The X-ray data were calculated considering the Q-dependence of the X-ray scattering cross-sections.
