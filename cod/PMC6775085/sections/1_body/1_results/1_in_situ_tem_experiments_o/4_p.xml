<p id="Par9">However, from 520 to 691 s, a thin nanowire with uniform diameter was produced, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e–g</xref>. During this stage of uniform growth, the region at the bottom part of the nanowire is boxed in the red rectangle, which is enlarged to pixel resolution in the inset in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>. The pixel measurement results indicate that a neck-shaped ligament, with characteristic height
