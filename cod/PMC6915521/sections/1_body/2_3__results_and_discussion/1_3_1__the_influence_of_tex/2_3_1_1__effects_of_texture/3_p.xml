<p>For a friction force, there are adhesion and ploughing components [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The textured surface can reduce the adhesion and ploughing components, which contributes to improving friction behaviors. On the one hand, due to the spacings between the textures, the textured surface can reduce the contact area and the interfacial shear strength, which reduces the adhesion component. On the other hand, the ploughing component is influenced by the total volume of ploughing and the force necessary to displace unit volume [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. With the increase in texture depth, more abrasive particles are trapped by the spacing, and then less atoms accumulate in front of the tip in the sliding process, which reduces the ploughing component. As a result, the two components of the friction force are reduced by the textured surface, so the average friction forces of the textured surfaces are lower than those in the smooth surface.
