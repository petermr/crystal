<p>After sample transfer to ambient conditions, the sample was investigated on the XRD1 beamline at the Elettra Synchrotron, Trieste, Italy, using a wavelength of 1.40 Å and a Pilatus 2M detector approximately 200 mm away from the sample. After setup calibration using an LaB
 <sub>6</sub> standard, sample alignment was performed using rocking curves, height scans and translation scans (
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic>) to locate the midpoint of the substrate surface in the centre of rotation for all relevant movements required during rotating GIXD data collection. For all these scans, 
 <italic>GIDVis</italic> was used for fast extraction of two-dimensional scans from sets of two-dimensional images and subsequent evaluation. For the rotating GIXD measurements the incident angle was set to 0.4°, which corresponds to around 80% of the critical angle of gold at this wavelength (Henke 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993

Using an exposure time of 10 s per image, 180 single images with a Φ step size (azimuthal rotation) of 2° were collected, so that information from a full 360° sample rotation was obtained. Diffraction data were recorded continuously, which means that even for very narrow peaks the intensity was still collected.
