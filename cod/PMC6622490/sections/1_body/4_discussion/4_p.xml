<p>Thus, utilizing the noise pollution using the piezoelectric material concluded to be an applicable experiment. The electric energy produced from the proposed place of area 1.45 m2 containing 690 piezoelectric QB220-503YB transducers at the selected stations with LDEN higher than 70 dB was about 0.024 watts in an hour. And to make this amount of energy beneficial the area of the application needs to be maximized to at least with 2483 transducer units which need very large application area to make the amount of produced energy usable in lighting 1 LED street lamp for 1 hour, or it can be used in powering street advertisements and small devices or it can be stored and used when needed in applications that use greater amount of electric energy.</p>
