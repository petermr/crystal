<p>Zhonghuan Quantum Tech. together with researchers from the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, proposed to use QD‐based luminescent microspheres (QLMS),
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> as a type of a highly robust QD composite with long‐term operational stability. The fabrication procedure of their QLMS followed previously reported approaches,
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> with several modifications. After soaking and swelling treatment, the average pore size of silica microspheres became enlarged and allowed the QDs solution to penetrate the pores and get access inside the silica matrix. Upon QD incorporation, the mesoporous silica structure prevented the QDs from aggregation, and reduced the contact surface between the QDs and the silicone, as well as between QDs and permeated oxygen and moisture promoting their stability. It was claimed that QLMS are fully compatible with current LED packaging processes and can be used as phosphors for direct on‐chip applications, meaning that tubes or films would be not required.
