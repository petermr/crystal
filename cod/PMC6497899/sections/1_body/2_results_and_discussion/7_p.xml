<p id="Par42">The emission spectra of the as-fabricated WLED with the driving currents of 5 mA-120 mA are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. The detailed characteristics including color coordinates, CCT, and CRI of the as-fabricated WLED are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, the EL intensities of both peaks increase gradually along with increasing the current and show no saturation. Besides, no obvious shift of the peak position for the EL spectrum occurred under different injection currents. Color coordinates of these PL spectra are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b. The chromaticity coordinates show little shift (
 <italic>x</italic> &lt; 0.02, 
 <italic>y</italic> &lt; 0.02) to the left with increasing the driving currents. We can observe that the EL intensity of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> increases faster than that of the Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub>, which can result in chromaticity coordinates moving left. However, the FWHM variation and the shift of emission peak also cause chromaticity coordinates to move. As we discussed above, the emission peak is unchanged with the increase of currents. Because of their broad FWHM, the emission peaks of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> overlap, which is difficult to analyze the FWHM variation. Therefore, monochromatic LEDs have been fabricated to analyze each FWHM variation. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c and d show the emission spectra of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> LEDs, respectively. In the wide current range from 5 to 120 mA, no shift of the PL emission peaks occurs, which is in good accordance with the WLED results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c and d). The FWHM variation of the coated LEDs under different currents is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e. As can be seen, the FWHMs of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> are nearly constant, indicating that the variation of chromaticity coordinates of the WLED only results from the change of intensity of the EL. The difference of EL intensity variation perhaps comes from the different thermal stability of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub>, because the increase of currents could result in the temperature of LED chip increasing. This insignificant change can be further alleviated by adopting a remote-type LED structure. Moreover, the long-term operating stability can be observed from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f. After a continuous work of 300 h, the EL intensities of both Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> are declined less than 10%. Actually, the half-life of the WLED is 3000 h, which is far better than I-containing perovskites [

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, after the as-prepared WLED continues working at 15 mA over 50 h, the PL intensity drops to 99% of the original, which is much better than other reports [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–
