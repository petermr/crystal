<p>Fig. 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref> shows several pole figures calculated from the rotating GIXD experiment, allowing the determination of the in-plane orientation of the P2O crystallites with respect to the single-crystalline Au(111) substrate. For detailed analysis, the pole figures were exported from 
 <italic>GIDVis</italic> as 
 <monospace>.rwa</monospace> files and analysed using the standalone software 
 <italic>Stereopole</italic> (Salzmann &amp; Resel, 2004

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>c</italic>)–6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>f</italic>). For several of the pole figures, six areas of high intensity (enhanced pole densities, EPD) are found [Figs. 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>a</italic>), 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>c</italic>) and 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>f</italic>)], while there is also one with only three [Fig. 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>g</italic>)]. The others show even more EPD within a single pole figure [Fig. 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>b</italic>), 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>d</italic>) and 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>e</italic>)]. Using the information gained from the integral measurements, we already know that the EPD can be explained by the P2O bulk crystal structure in a (140) orientation. Together with the sixfold gold surface symmetry, all of the observed peaks can be explained. Note that both the reciprocal-space map and the pole figures could also be explained with the crystallographic equivalent orientation
