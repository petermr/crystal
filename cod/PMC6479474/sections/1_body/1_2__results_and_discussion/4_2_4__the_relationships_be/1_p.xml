<p>Important conclusions may be drawn from the detailed comprehension of both IR and NIR spectra of crystalline melamine. The vibrational modes involving out-of-plane atomic motions are much more essential in the IR region (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01402-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and thus a proper reflection of the inter-plane structure of crystalline melamine is required. Therefore, calculations that are based on a 3D infinite model of crystal lattice allows for the best description of these vibrations, even with harmonic approximation. However, in the NIR spectrum the most influential modes are those that involve in-plane atomic displacements. Thus, the neighboring planes of crystalline lattice do not impact these motions as much. Therefore, the NIR modes calculated for a single molecule are largely enough to accurately reflect the experimental spectrum.
