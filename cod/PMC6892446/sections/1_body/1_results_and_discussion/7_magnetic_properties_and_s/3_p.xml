<p>Magnetic measurements of

  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> revealed diamagnetic behavior between 1.8 and 300 K, which are qualitative results only due to the high content of diamagnetic alkali metal hydroxide (Figure S21 Supporting Information). The small increase of the magnetic moment is probably caused by a trace of decomposition product, which could form during the different transfer processes. The measured magnetic moments were corrected by the respective diamagnetic increments, which results in a positive susceptibility.
