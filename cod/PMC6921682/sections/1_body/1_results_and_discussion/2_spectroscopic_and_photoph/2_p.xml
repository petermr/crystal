<p>(Dim) molecule(s), 
 <bold>2-Dim</bold> and 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold>, were prepared by the similar reactions to the synthetic procedures to 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> except for using Dim and deuterated solvents: D
 <sub>2</sub>O for 
 <bold>2</bold>-Dim and CD
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/diethylether-d
 <sub>10</sub> for 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold>, respectively. The emission spectral and photophysical data of 
 <bold>2-Dim</bold> and 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold> in crystalline phase are also listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>. The λ
 <sub>em</sub> and τ
 <sub>em</sub> values of 
 <bold>2-Dim</bold> at both 296 and 80 K are similar to those of 
 <bold>2</bold>, as shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02749/suppl_file/ao9b02749_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>, Figures S4 and S5. These results indicate that the deuterated ligand gives almost no influence to the excited state character and luminescence properties of 
 <bold>2</bold>. In 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>, the emission spectra and the λ
 <sub>em</sub> values are similar to each other, while the τ
 <sub>em</sub> values of 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold> in the crystalline phase are different at both 296 and 80 K. The weighted average value of τ
 <sub>em</sub> for 
 <bold>5</bold>-Dim (0.16 μs) are longer than that for 
 <bold>5</bold> (0.070 μs) at 296 K. The results suggest that the deuterated ligand in 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold> is hardly contribute to the radiative process while that influences significantly nonradiative decay of the excited states of 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold>. Therefore, the weak luminescence from 
 <bold>5</bold> is attributed to excited-state deactivation by vibronic relaxation through the N–H···N hydrogen interactions. The longer emission lifetime of 
 <bold>5-Dim</bold> compared to that of 
 <bold>5</bold> would be due to suppression of excited-state quenching by the slow vibration of the N–D···N hydrogen bond compared to that of the N–H···N hydrogen bond. As the noncoordinate Him interacts with the nitrido by the C–H···N bond, the bond may be also involved in the luminescence quenching in 
 <bold>5</bold>.
