 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> indicates how a PHC (red) can diffuse on a ZnO surface 
 <italic>via</italic> a series of PT events. The ZnO surface is depicted only schematically; the true two and three-dimensional structures of the surfaces influence the possible sequence of PT events, and the directions in which the PHC diffuses, as we will explore in more detail below.
