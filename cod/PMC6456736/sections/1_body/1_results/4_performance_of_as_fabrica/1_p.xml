<p id="Par12">To further evaluate the potential application of NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in white LED lighting for improving the color-rendering index, we fabricated white LED lamps by using the cyan phosphor NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, the commercial yellow phosphor YAG:Ce and the commercial red phosphor KSF:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> on a blue LED InGaN chip (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 455 nm) under various drive currents and compared them with the white LED without the cyan phosphor NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref> comparatively show the emission spectra of the as-fabricated LED1 (without the sample) and LED2 (with the sample) devices under a current of 20 mA, and the insets show the photographs of the fabricated and lit white LEDs. LED1 presents warm white light with a CCT of 4119 K, a 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> of 86 and chromaticity coordinates of (0.3742, 0.3690). However, LED1 shows a cyan gap causing the limited enhancement in the color-rendering index (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>a</sub>), which is difficult to exceed 90. As the cyan phosphor NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> was added into the device, LED2 shows a similar CCT of 4021 K and chromaticity coordinates of (0.3835, 0.3910), but the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> can be enhanced to 95.2, indicating the great application potential of the device in full-spectrum lighting for enhanced color rendition. The emission spectra and the variation in chromaticity coordinates of the white LED devices under various drive currents are shown in Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S5</xref>. The provided photoelectric parameters also show that the chromaticity coordinates of LED1 shift more than those of LED2, indicating that LED2 has better color stability when the drive current increases from 20 to 120 mA.
