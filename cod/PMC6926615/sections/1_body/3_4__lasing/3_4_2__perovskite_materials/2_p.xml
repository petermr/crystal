<p>From the analysis of recent publications, it can be inferred that the active material and corresponding type of resonator are connected to each other. DBR or VCSEL are suitable for the perovskite thin films, which can be easily deposited on the mirrors or waveguide surfaces via CVD or “wet” precursor spin-casting routes. In work [
 <xref rid="B120-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], it was shown that the room temperature lasing can be achieved in CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> thermally imprinted layers as active material at threshold down to 2.2 µJ cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (

The single crystals, which are grown from the precursor solution on the substrates, can play role of the microcavity themselves. For instance, the perovskite microwires serve as the active medium and F-P resonator at the same time. In work [
 <xref rid="B125-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>], it was shown that composition-graded CsPbBr
 <sub>x</sub>I
 <sub>3−x</sub> nanowires can be formed by vapor-phase growth on mica, which possess varied bandgaps along the wire and, hence, blueshifted emission observed at the wire’s ends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f006">Figure 6</xref>f). In these wires, a double-color lasing is achieved with 35 nm separation between the emission bands, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f006">Figure 6</xref>g. Since the F-P resonators provide a multi-mode generation, a controllable selection of lasing mode is in high demand for future tunable lasers. In work [
 <xref rid="B103-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], the authors showed the implementation of organic microdisk with specific transmittance spectrum, which can be used as a filter for the lasing modes of perovskite microwires, as shown in
