<p id="Par10">To test whether the enhanced catalytic activity could be caused by an irreversible crystal structure change, PXRD and Raman spectroscopy were performed immediately after reductive potential cycling. Both PXRD and Raman measurements were performed directly on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode on which the catalyst had been deposited. This also allowed for confirmation that the preparation of the catalyst on the electrode had no effect on the structure of the materials. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and b show the PXRD patterns and Raman spectra of the nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> obtained before and after 1000 CV cycles. It is clear that the material remains unchanged; hence we can eliminate any structural changes as the cause of the enhanced catalytic activity.
