<p id="Par7">The aforementioned results were obtained using GMO films with thicknesses larger than 60 nm, where relaxed structures are expected to occur. In this work, we report an earlier not reported tetragonal phase in epitaxially strained GdMnO
 <sub>3</sub> films onto (001)-oriented SrTiO
 <sub>3</sub> substrate, with a thickness up to 35 nm, deposited by magnetron RF-magnetron sputtering technique. The polar properties are studied by measuring the pyroelectric current using different experimental conditions.
