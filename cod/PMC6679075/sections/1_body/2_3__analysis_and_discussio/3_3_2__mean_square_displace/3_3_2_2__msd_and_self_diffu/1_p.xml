<p>The mean square displacement curves and self-diffusion coefficients of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer of the Ca–montmorillonite with different charge characteristics are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02318-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f005">Figure 5</xref>. We can see that the self-diffusion coefficients of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> were obviously affected by the position of the lattice substitution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). When the layer charge of montmorillonite was mostly formed in a tetrahedron, the diffusion coefficient of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> was lower than that formed in an octahedron because of the short-range effect, as mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1dot2-materials-12-02318">Section 3.1.2</xref>. The influence of charge density on the diffusion of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f005">Figure 5</xref>b; as the charge density of montmorillonite increased, the electrostatic attraction between the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and the Si–O surface strengthened, as a result, the diffusion coefficient of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> was lower. This is consistent with Seppälä’s [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] conclusion that the diffusion coefficient of calcium ions decreases with the increase in the layer charge.
