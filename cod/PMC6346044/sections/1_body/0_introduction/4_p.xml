<p id="Par5">This article is organized as follows. In the 
 <italic>Model and methods</italic> section the model potential for the NaK alloy is provided along with a description of the Monte Carlo methodology used in the atomistic simulations. The definition of the topological attributes used in the machine learning analyses is also included in this section. The section entitled 
 <italic>Energetics and structure of eutectic NaK</italic> describes the thermodynamic properties obtained along the thermal annealing process of the NaK alloy obtained with atomistic simulations and the structural analysis performed to characterize the three different phases detected. The atomic positions in each configuration obtained in this section constitute the dataset that we used for further study. Description of the topological attributes for the machine learning approaches of the dataset is given in the 
 <italic>Data analyses of the topological attributes</italic>, along with the data-based analyses of principal component, unsupervised learning data clustering, and data classification approaches. Our results highlight the ability of machine learning in analyzing intrinsic thermodynamic behavior, and at the same time providing valuable guidance for inspection of other metal alloys in condensed phases. This work is concluded in 
 <italic>Conclusion</italic> with a discussion of the results.
