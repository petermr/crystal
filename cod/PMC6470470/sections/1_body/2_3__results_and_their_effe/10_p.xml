<p>Our predictions are lower than experimental results for Fe (∼0.34 mPas for edge and ∼0.661 mPas for screw, cf. [
 <xref rid="B62-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]) and Zn for both basal slip (0.035 mPas for edge and ∼0.034 mPas for screw, cf. [
 <xref rid="B63-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]) as well as for pyramidal slip (0.27 mPas for edge and ∼0.16 mPas for screw, cf. [
