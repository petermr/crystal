<p id="Par4">Let us stress that none of the above methods can be applied to cubic crystalline materials, because the optical indicatrix of cubic crystals does not have any special direction and these crystals have no oblique phonon eigenmodes. Fortunately, there is still another possibility, which is applicable to cubic crystals. We are suggesting here a method for detection of a completely arbitrary crystallite orientation by relying only on the universal polarisation dependence of Raman scattering by their doubly degenerate nonpolar phonon modes. The procedure is demonstrated here on a polycrystalline ceramic pellet of a cubic lacunar spinel GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub>. We have chosen GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub> since it is a cubic substance with well-separated Raman active doublet modes and at the same time it is known to be one of the very few hosts of magnetoelectric skyrmion phases
