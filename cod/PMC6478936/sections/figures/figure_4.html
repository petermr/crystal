 <caption> Photoluminescence properties of SALON. a Normalized excitation (grey, for the emission at λ max equals 614 nm) and emission spectrum (red, excited with λ exc equals 460 nm) of SALON in comparison to Sr[LiAl 3N 4]:Eu 2+  22 , reference (purple, data taken from literature) and the human-eye sensitivity curve (black dotted). b Comparison of two warm-white pc-LEDs (CCT equals 2700 K, CIE coordinates (SALON based LED): x/y equals 0.463/0.415; CIE coordinates (SLA based LED): x/y approximately equal 0.455/0.405, spectra normalized to integral intensity) with high colour rendering index (CRI greater than 90, R9 greater than 40). Purple curve taken from literature (Sr[LiAl 3N 4]:Eu 2+ as red phosphor), the red curve represents a mid-power pc-LED using the SALON phosphor as red component. c Relative luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) values for different warm-white pc-LED solutions (data normalized to the state of the art). Solutions marked with an asterisk are taken from the literature 22 . The solid red bar represents the relative LER value for the SALON containing phosphor solution with R9 greater than 40. d Relative photoluminescence intensity of SALON measured from 298 K to 500 K </caption>
