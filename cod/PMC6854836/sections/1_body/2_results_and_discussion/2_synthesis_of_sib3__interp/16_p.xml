<p>As a result of our synthesis efforts, we could clarify the interplay between α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> in the binary B–Si system. α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> appears metastable, whereas β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> represents a stable phase in the B–Si phase diagram. Both compounds decompose between 1250 and 1300 °C into SiB
 <sub>6</sub> and Si. In the next section, we address the precise composition and detailed structural properties of disordered α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>.
