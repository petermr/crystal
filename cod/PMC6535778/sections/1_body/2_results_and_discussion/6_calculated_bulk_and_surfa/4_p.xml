<p>It is well-established in materials physics that time-reversal-based topological insulators can be described by a “Z
 <sub>2</sub> invariant”. Generally, Z
 <sub>2</sub> is undefined in a time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking system such as a ferromagnetic phase. Nonetheless, recent studies have proposed that the Z
 <sub>2</sub> invariant can be expanded to classify topological states in magnetic systems if the system possesses a specific magnetic configuration, for instance, an antiferromagnetic state, in which the combined symmetry 
 <italic>S</italic> = Θ
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> is preserved, where Θ is the time-reversal operator, and 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> is the lattice translational symmetry of the crystal that is broken by the antiferromagnetic order.

 </sup> This is what we have in the current case. Under this definition, we calculate the Z
 <sub>2</sub> invariant by the Wilson loop method, as shown in

 </sup> The Z
 <sub>2</sub> topological invariant can be determined by looking at the evolution of the Wannier function center. In this formalism, the evolution of each Wannier center pair encloses the representation cylinder an integer number of times, which can be viewed as the “winding number” of the Wannier center pair. The Z
 <sub>2</sub> topological number is related to the summation of the winding numbers for all the pairs. If it is odd, then the Z
 <sub>2</sub> topological number is odd. According to

 </xref>, the entanglement entropy never becomes zero in the course of any gap- and symmetry-preserving transformation; this demonstrates the nontriviality of the electronic structure of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, i.e., its topological character.
