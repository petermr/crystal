<p id="p0060">The study of the microstructure of the samples was performed on a laser beam scanning microscope (LSM) KEYENCE VK-9700. The light source was a laser with a wavelength of 408 nm. Laser scanning resolution was 2048 × 1536 pixels with a 16-bit photomultiplier. The images of the internal structure on the cleaved samples with a magnification of 3000 times were obtained. The images were constructed using confocal microscopy. In that case, there was a sequential shooting of the images that were in focus at different heights. Everything that was above or below the focus was cut off by a confocal gap, and only the surface that was at a given height remained clear. Scanning was performed from top to bottom with a step of 0.1 μm (Z axis), after which all the images obtained at different heights were “stitched” to form a clear two-dimensional picture, and the data on the “height” (i.e., the vertical position of the eyepiece) made it possible to form a 3D visualization of the object under study without any contact with its surface.</p>
