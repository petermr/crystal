 </sup>. The physical properties in group-V elements are highly anisotropic due to asymmetric chemical bonding character. Non-simple structures are described as follows: covalently bonded atomic layers are weakly held together by van der Waals’ force, can easily cleave in the corresponding plane, and design a two-dimensional structure. Two-dimensional semiconductors have been proposed due to their promising device characteristics such as black phosphorus consisting of layer of phoshorene
