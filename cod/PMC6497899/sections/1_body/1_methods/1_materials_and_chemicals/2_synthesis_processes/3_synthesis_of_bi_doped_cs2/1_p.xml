<p id="Par33">The Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction method. Typically, 0.337 g of CsCl, 0.189 g of SnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.032 g of BiCl
 <sub>3</sub> powders, and 4.0 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid were sealed into a Teflon-lined autoclave (30 mL) and heated at 220 °C for 20 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was slowly cooled to room temperature, and a white crystal of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> could be separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 2 min).
