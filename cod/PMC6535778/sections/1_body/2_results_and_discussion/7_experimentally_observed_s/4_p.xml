<p>We note that the calculations show the bottom of six elliptical electron pockets around the M point of the BZ, which are slightly above the chemical potential (about −220 meV compared to the calculated

 <sub>F</sub>) observed in the ARPES experiments. This explains why no trace of those calculated bands is seen in ARPES (which sees only filled states) and further gives a hint for why the results of potassium adsorption measurements, expected to electron-dope the surface, resulted in no noticeable band shifts—the flat bottom of an electron pocket is associated with a high density of states, and all the states have to be filled for the shifts in other bands to be observed. We also note that our ARPES measurements at varying incident photon energies show remarkably little difference in the band structure of EuSn
