The DRG consists of multiple concentric rings which are interconnected through 8 spokes on one layer that are anchored at the center. Sixteen electrodes are set around the sensing structure for driving, sensing and tuning. The DRG has a degenerate pair of in-plane wineglass modes, also called 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 cosine and sine modes which have the identical natural frequency but indistinguishable mode shapes, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. It is driven to vibration at one of the wineglass modes and the Coriolis-based rotation rate signal is detected at another wineglass mode. As the 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 sine mode can be easily obtained by transferring the vibrating orientation of cosine mode from 0° to 45°, in this paper, only the cosine mode is analyzed to simplify the analyzing process.
