<p>The last part of this study deals with the optical photochromic response of the as-prepared powders under UV irradiation. For this purpose, in the first part, the diffuse reflectance spectra on the whole UV-visible-NIR range of three reference samples (black, blue and yellow samples) were characterized before UV irradiation and after 90 min irradiation, using a UV source (mercury lamp with 254 nm wavelength). Ex-situ diffuse reflection spectra were also recorded versus irradiation duration on the raw materials (blue WO
 <sub>3</sub>). The results obtained are gathered in
