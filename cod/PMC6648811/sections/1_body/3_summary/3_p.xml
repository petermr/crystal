<p>We had anticipated that the different commercial formulations of the silicone polymers might lead to considerable differences in performance with regard to NO uncaging. However, the differences are relatively small, with both the quantity and Ï„
 <sub>decay</sub> for NO release upon a short-term (e.g., 1 s) excitation varying only about a factor of 2 for the various formulations (SI

This similarity may, in part, be due to each of these formulations being silicone-based but also is likely the result of the photoNORM being infused into preformed PDs as opposed to being codissolved prior to the gelling process. As a result, this precursor is located at readily accessible sites where NO once uncaged can diffuse to the surface. In contrast, Ostrowski and co-workers prepared similarly sized films of composites but dissolved their photoNORM in the polymers prior to curing, resulting in marked differences in release efficiencies depending on the gas permeabilities of the materials involved.
