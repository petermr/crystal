<p id="Par29">Our experience on this method implies three critical points of concern to be adjusted to the system under investigation, to guarantee the success of the structure-prediction algorithm. First, a large enough sampling of the plausible local structures is needed in the set of reference structures. Second, the interval between grid points (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) has to be chosen fine enough. In this work, we used a value of 0.2 Å. Third, too loose criteria for describing the local environments of atoms may lead to improper bonding configurations that deviate from the true metal-ligand chemistry. We found reasonable to allow up to about 10% error in S–Au bond length and in RS–Au–SR angles depending on the number of nearest neighbors considered in the description. All the parameters we used were based on statistical analysis of experimental structural data of a similar class of clusters in question.
