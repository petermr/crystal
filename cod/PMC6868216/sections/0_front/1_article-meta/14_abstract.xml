 <p id="Par2">Here the authors report a near-infrared K
  <sub>3</sub>LuSi
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>7</sub>:Eu
  <sup>2+</sup> phosphor for non-visible light source application. The selective site occupation of Eu
  <sup>2+</sup> in LuO
  <sub>6</sub> and K2O
  <sub>6</sub> polyhedrons is found to beÂ responsible for the light emission and these insights could serve as design principles for discovery and design of such phosphors.
