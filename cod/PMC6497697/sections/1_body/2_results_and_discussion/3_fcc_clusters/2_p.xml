<p>Alloys of these elements are also of interest, but references of these are too numerous to be cited here. Frequently, the common shapes synthesized are cubes, octahedra, cuboctahedra, and icosahedra. Typically, clusters with (111) facets are easier to synthesize, since the (111) surface usually has a lower energy than the (100) surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We find for the fcc rhombic dodecahedron that there exist even and odd formulas. These agree with those in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], if one replaces the “
 <italic>n</italic>” in our even formulas by 2(
 <italic>m</italic>−1). The formulas for fcc cuboctahedra listed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] produce the same magic numbers as ours but are shifted by 1 since they number shells as 
 <italic>n</italic>=1,2,… and we use the numbering 
 <italic>n</italic>=0,1,…. Our magic formulas agree with those in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and in deference to the earlier published work, and in maintaining continuity of the mathematics, we use the [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] notation. The 5 fcc cluster shapes and their associated magic formulas appear below.
