       <p id="p0015">Our data provide Si(1 1 0) and Si(17 15 1) surface atomistic models and related calculated STM images being in agreement with all available experimental STM data. The atomic coordinates can be directly reused in other calculations related to (1 1 0) surfaces of silicon and germanium.</p>

       <p id="p0020">Sharing our data is useful for the physicist and material scientists working with the Si(1 1 0) and Ge(1 1 0) surfaces. Experimentalists such as crystallographers and crystal growers will benefit from our surface structural models and calculated STM images. Computational physicists will take advantage from our datasets which are represented by atomistic coordinates.</p>

       <p id="p0025">The models allow to derive experimentally testable hypotheses and to interpret experimental data correctly. The calculated STM images will allow researchers to sustain further our models validation. In addition, the coordinates can be used in future first-principles calculations in conjunction with experimentalists working with Si(1 1 0) and Ge(1 1 0) surfaces.</p>
