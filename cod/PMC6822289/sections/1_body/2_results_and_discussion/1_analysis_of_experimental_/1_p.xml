<p>The database of experimental COFs we are considering contains 324 structures, with 310 being neutral and the remaining 14 being charged: in this second case counterions are necessary to maintain the neutrality of the system, and these charged molecules have been kept in the pore as reported in the reference paper. The counterions found in these structures are dimethylammonium, tetrafluoroborate, and single atom ions, e.g., Li

 </xref> reports the variety of elements in these crystals, distinguishing between 2D/3D and neutral/charged frameworks. One can note that these COFs contain a number of transition metals, e.g., Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. However, unlike MOFs, these metals are not part of the connection nodes, but they are embedded in ligands, typically in porphyrins and phthalocyanines.
