<p>Transient absorbance measurement is one of the most direct evidences for the exciton self‐trapping. Under the excitation of a near‐UV light, (
 <italic>N</italic>‐MEDA)PbBr
 <sub>4</sub> shows a broad absorption in the range of visible spectrum, which is consistent with the formation of short‐lived, light‐induced defect states.[qv: 18a] In addition, for (
 <italic>N</italic>‐MEDA)PbBr
 <sub>4</sub>, the wavelength‐dependent PL shows that the onset time of broad emission is dependent on wavelength, and the decay time also shows the emission wavelength dependence due to the self‐trapped states.[qv: 18a] On the whole, these measurements prove the mechanism of the broad emission depicted in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e.[qv: 18a] After photon excitation, free excitons are formed in picoseconds, and then self‐trapped excitons formed by lattice distortion begin to generate broad emission, and the deeper the self‐trapped states, the lower the energy and the longer the PL wavelength. Zhang et al. reported that (OAm)
 <sub>2</sub>SnBr
 <sub>4</sub> 2D perovskites emitted a wide orange light with a PLQY of 88%, which is the highest value among the known lead‐free 2D perovskites.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> Different from the white light emission with two peaks from the PbBr 2D perovskite, (OAm)
 <sub>2</sub>SnBr
 <sub>4</sub> has only one PL peak located at 620 nm with an FWHM of 140 nm upon 365 nm excitation (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f). The emission is only from the exciton self‐trapping state, because the Sn
 <sup>2+</sup> lone pair with higher chemical activity leads to stronger excited state structure distortion and coupling of photogenerated electrons/holes with the lattice of tin halide.
