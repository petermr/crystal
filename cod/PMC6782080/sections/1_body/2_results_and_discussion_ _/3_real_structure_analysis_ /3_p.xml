 </inline-formula> as well. For crystals with hexagonal symmetry having the wurtzite-type structure, uni­directional crystal growth along the {0001} planes is promoted under a broad range of process conditions, as this growth direction minimizes the electrostatic energy between Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and O
 <sup>2−</sup> terminated surfaces. However, the introduction of planar defects parallel to the polar surfaces can decrease the surface energy and stabilize different crystal morphologies, as has already been described for nanobelts (Ding 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> ▸</xref>) and whiskers (Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb18"> ▸</xref>, 2009
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb19"> ▸</xref>). Owing to the observed multiple twin defects, this explanation might also be applicable to the nanospikes investigated herein. A growth model for ZnO nanospikes from a partially molten Zn source including such mosaic and multiple twinning has been proposed by Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2009
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb19"> ▸</xref>). They described the initial twinning of condensate seeds and further coalescence and intergrowth of individual spikes, resulting in a mosaic twinned structure with a tapered shape. Very similar growth conditions are believed to apply during the flame-transport process.
