<p id="Par32">To conclude, we have shown that inspection of important thermodynamic properties of materials in the condensed phase is achievable by fusing the notions of topological attributes of the system and machine learning methods. Using a dataset consisting of 18672 configurations obtained from NPT MMC simulations of the NaK eutectic alloy, we have presented a machine learning protocol that allows us to reveal a mapping between independently accessible attributes of a system and its various thermodynamic properties. Firstly, we have shown that three phases of the eutectic NaK alloy can be identified, liquid, crystalline solid, and amorphous solid along the annealing procedure with NPT MMC simulations. From the current simulations, 18672 configurations registering the Cartesian coordinates of 2000 atoms were saved for further analysis. Secondly, based on the Voronoi tessellation, a set of 48 topological attributes were calculated for each configuration. Thirdly, with machine learning techniques these topological attributes were reduced to 26 based on ranking, and further to 3 through principal component analysis. The latter were used to cluster the configurations into three data clusters. These data clusters reproduced almost perfectly the liquid, amorphous, and crystalline condensed phases determined with the simulations. As a fourth step, a verification of the validity of the splitting into data clusters was carried out with the Random Forest classification. Analysis of these classes and the connection to the temperatures at which the configurations were obtained allowed to validate the clustering process and provided a robust estimate of the temperature range at which the system melts, 220–310 K, and at which the system transitions into a amorphous-like solid at 130–170 K.</p>
