<p>For cadmium‐free QRs, indium phosphide can be a potential replacement candidate, but the bandgap for bulk InP is 1.35 eV, smaller than that of CdSe. In order to reach the same emission wavelength, the core size of the InP QDs must also be smaller than that of CdSe. Smaller bandgaps and smaller particle sizes lead to much stronger confinement effects, and as a result, the emission spectrum of InP QDs is more susceptible to particle size variations, and its FWHM is somewhat broader (&gt;40 nm). This corresponds to a 70−80% Rec. 2020 color gamut, depending on the color filters employed. However, backlights based on InP QDs have already been widely used in TV products, such as in Samsung QD TV series, and have exhibited excellent performance and long lifetime.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref> InP QDs are non‐toxic, however, there are still synthetic challenges, given that phosphide precursors are highly reactive and potentially dangerous. This issue is even worse for anisotropic NCs based on InP, given the synthetic demands of higher concentration and, often, more reactive precursors. One approach proposed by Nanosys is a “greener” QD system obtained by combining the Cd‐free and low Cd‐based QDs.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">64</xref> This hybrid approach not only retains 90% Rec. 2020 color gamut but also complies with the RoHS regulation.
