 </sup>. While in that work it was the superconductivity (and its coupling to a bosonic excitation) that was studied, we anticipate that a measure suitably adapted to the case of the antiferromagnetic order here could also yield insight. If reduced spin fluctuations are in fact at work here, the momentum and energy dependent differential conductance g(

 <sub>N</sub>. In particular, generally sharper (as a function of momentum and energy) peaks are expected in the conductance in this material, when measured at the same temperature as the lower Néel point crystal. Future experimental studies would be highly beneficial are to assess this possibility.
