<p id="Par10">In addition, CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/ySm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors PL spectra, y varying from 0 to 0.32, were measured, and shown on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. It can be clearly observed that with Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion doping concentration increasing, the characteristic peaks intensity of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> at 479 nm and 573 nm both show gradually decreasing due to existence of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> → Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> energy transfer in Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> co-doped CLSO phosphors system. However, peak at 601 nm which is the characteristic emission of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion in CLSO system, do not exhibit an obvious increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,c</xref>)with its concentration increasing that is different from Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> single doped CLSO spectra (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). And there two hypotheses proposed, the first one is that absorption and emission efficiency of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> at 365 nm wavelength both are much higher than those of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> in CLSO system, the other one is that in the system maybe exist Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> → Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> → Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> non-radiative energy transfer phenomenon too.
