  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
 </sup> code. In this approach, the phonon frequencies are determined based on force constant matrices, after the corresponding sets of the interatomic forces have been computed within supercells, in which a particular atom had been elongated. The interatomic forces were calculated using VASP in the Γ-point approximation, an approach that has largely been employed elsewhere.

 </sup> The supercells employed in the computations corresponded to 4 × 4 × 4 and 2 × 2 × 2 expansions of the structurally optimized unit cells of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and M
