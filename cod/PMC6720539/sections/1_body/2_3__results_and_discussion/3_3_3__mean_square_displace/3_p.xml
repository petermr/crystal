<p>It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f005">Figure 5</xref> that the MSD curves of the water molecules in the four kinds of montmorillonite are obviously different. Comparatively speaking, the mobility of water molecules in M1 is the highest and the mobility of water molecules in M4 is the lowest. According to formula (1), the calculated diffusion coefficient of water molecules

 <sup>2</sup>/s, 0.87 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> m

 <sup>−10</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s, and 0.28 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. Obviously, the diffusion coefficient of water molecules between layers decreases with the increase of charge density. The reason is that as the charge density of the layer increases, the number of hydrogen bonds formed between H
 <sub>w</sub> and O
 <sub>t</sub> increases, and more and more water molecules are bound to the Si-O surface, thus reducing its self-diffusion coefficient.
