<p>The mechanical milling of the corresponding metal hydride and aluminum and further ex-situ hydrogenation can produce some alanates. Or in-situ by means of a hydrogen atmosphere during the milling. In the ex-situ approach, the hydrogenation of the milled precursors is performed in a specialized reactor (Sieverts type apparatus) to complete Equations (1) and (2). The typical example is the NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> synthesis by means of mechanical milling of NaH and Al, or Na and Al, and further hydrogenation facilitated by additives, dopants, or catalysts. In the in-situ approach (or reactive mechanical milling), the production of alanates can be attained by the solid-gas reaction between the metal hydride, aluminum, additives, and hydrogen. Again, the typical example is the one-step synthesis of NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> [
