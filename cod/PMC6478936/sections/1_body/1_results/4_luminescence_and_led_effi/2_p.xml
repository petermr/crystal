<p id="Par18">To ensure that SALON does not suffer from pronounced thermal quenching, the temperature dependence of the integrated photoluminescence intensity was investigated for a powder sample from 298 K to 500 K (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Low-temperature luminescence investigations showed a gradual reduction of the FWHM yielding 41 nm at 15 K. Interestingly, the FWHM reduction mainly occurs on the high energy side of the emission spectrum (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Even at typical LED operating temperatures of 420 K, the integrated light output of SALON drops by only 4% compared to the initial intensity at room temperature (298 K), while compounds, which suffer from considerable thermal quenching like SrMg

 </sup>, have already lost over 90% of their maximum intensity at this temperature (420 K)

 <italic>y</italic> equals 0.029/0.028), and LER-values of SALON was also recorded in the range from 298 to 473 K. This is a rather small colour shift and comparable to the shift found in Sr[LiAl

 <italic>y</italic> equals 0.025/0.024) between 303 K and 465 K. Finally, the quantum efficiency (number of converted photons emitted/number of photons absorbed in %) of SALON was determined to be greater than or equal to 80%. This value should be comparable to the literature value for the “internal quantum efficiency” of Sr[LiAl
