 <sub>2</sub>Nb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>) is characterized by the strong adsorption in the UV region, peaking at 252 nm. The introduction of NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> to the composition leads to the formation of the second component at lower frequencies. The separation of two components is the most distinct for both NCN0.10 and NCN0.25. Fitting with gaussians (
