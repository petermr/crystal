<p>The full Heusler compound is normally presented by a generic formula as X
 <sub>2</sub>YZ and has a cubic structure with four interpenetrating face-centred cubic sublattices, which can be defined by the Wyckoff coordinates as A(0, 0, 0), B(0.25, 0.25, 0.25), C(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and D(0.75, 0.75, 0.75). X and Y are transition metal elements and they enter A, B and C sites; Z is from main group elements and it enters D site. Different arrangements of transition metal elements X and Y at A, B and C Wyckoff positions generally result into two different structures: the Cu
 <sub>2</sub>MnAl-type and the Hg
 <sub>2</sub>CuTi-type. The former one is also known as L2
 <sub>1</sub>-type structure (Fm-
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</span>m space group, No. 225), where the two X atoms occupy A and C positions, and the latter one is known as XA-type structure (F-
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</span>3m space group, No. 216), where the two X atoms occupy A and B positions. We select Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi as an example and show the two cubic crystal structures in

 <italic>a</italic>,
 <italic>b</italic>. For L2
 <sub>1</sub>-type structure of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi, the four Wyckoff sites A, B, C and D are occupied by Fe1, Ni, Fe2 and Si atoms, respectively. Whereas, for the XA-type structure, the four Wyckoff sites A, B, C and D are occupied by Fe1, Fe2, Ni and Si atoms, respectively.
