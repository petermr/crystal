<p>In decisive contrast to the IR region (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the NIR bands of crystalline melamine are accurately reproduced on the basis of a finite model. In this case, even the calculations that are based on a single molecule of melamine provide good agreement between the calculated and experimental spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>). If further studies will allow for generalizing this observation, a lower requirement for the model complexity in modeling of NIR spectra could open other opportunities for refining the theoretical approach. For example, a hybrid approach combining higher-level harmonic computations augmenting DVPT2/GVPT2 anharmonic analysis could be used. Barone and co-workers have reported evidences of accurate and affordable hybrid B3LYP(harmonic)/B2PLYP(anharmonic) computations [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], as also seen in our previous studies [
