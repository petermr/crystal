<p>This paper proposes a method based on component mode synthesis (CMS) technique to mathematically model complex multiring DRGs for the first time. Firstly, the design model and working principle of multiring DRGs are described and then the CMS technique is used to calculate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the DRGs. Comparison of natural frequencies and mode shapes obtained by the mathematical modeling and FEA methods demonstrates the feasibility and effectivity of the mathematical analysis method. At last, the natural frequencies and mode shapes are used for calculation of the lumped mass-spring model of the DRG and the effects of geometrical parameters on the lumped mass-spring parameters are investigated which is useful for the DRG design. As the mathematical model is theoretical in nature, it is unavoidable having differences with the experimental results of the fabricated devices. To make the theoretical results more accurate, this paper assumes that the geometrical parameters and material properties of the devices are identical with that used in the theoretical model; meanwhile, the devices are well fabricated without any defects and correctly tested. This mathematical modeling method can also be used on the analysis of other modes of the DRG or other multiring-type resonators.</p>
