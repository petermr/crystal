 <sub>2</sub> comes from the FPLO calculations. The results of these calculations taking into account spin–orbit coupling and antiferromagnetism of Mn atoms are fully consistent with previously discussed LMTO calculations with slightly different energy positions of the Mn-band and Dirac points (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> with Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>). The corresponding Fermi surface is shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Unlike in the case of LMTO calculations, no small loops are present and a pair of very closely separated Weyl points (#3 and #4) is detected instead. The other two pairs are qualitatively the same. Importantly, the most separated in the 
 <bold>k</bold>-space Weyl points (#5 and #6) are of the type II (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>) and connect the non-degenerate lenses with electron pockets, exactly as in the experiment, although the calculated lenses are noticeably smaller (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The Weyl points #1 and #2 are situated above each other and thus are not expected to contribute to the surface states on the measured 001 surface. The momentum separation of points #3 and #4 is too small to be resolved by our experiment.
