<p>Last, we turn to discuss various other mechanisms proposed for the resistivity upturn around 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> in the context of our new findings. The first is the CDW, possibly electronically driven (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>), a suppression of which by Zeeman splitting in magnetic fields would lead to the giant negative MR (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>). This suppression is expected to lead to an isotropic negative MR, however an expectation that is incompatible with the emerging symmetry axis unveiled by more detailed angular characterization in the present study. In the case of disorder-induced localization (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>), the MR is also expected to display mirror symmetry within the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane, in notable contrast to the mirror symmetryâ€“breaking response of the dark excitons that naturally correlates with the emerging symmetry axis. The dark exciton theory is, thus, expected to be an essential part of any mechanism accounting for the mysterious resistivity upturn, although how superconductivity develops with itinerant residual carriers in the presence of crystallized (localized) dark excitons is yet to be explored.
