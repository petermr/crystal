<p id="p0770">Thus, as the driver of the reorganization process of the nuclear subsystem in a molecule in addition to the electronic motion, which by creating chaos starts the process, the very vibrational motion of the nuclei acts, which is transformed into a chaotic motion, performing in effect the very process of reorganization of the nuclei. (Vibrations of the nuclei in a molecule are always present, even at absolute zero and zero-point oscillations of the nuclei.) Moreover, the motion of the electrons and nuclei in a molecule in the process of a quantum transition (for example, excitation of an electron-vibrational transition) is undergoing a dramatic change in its nature. Namely, the quantum motion in the adiabatic ground state dies as a result of the launch of the chaotic process of a “quantum” transition and again revives as a result of the completion of this process in the excited adiabatic (or nearly adiabatic) state.
