<p>The sample for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was prepared by mechanical grinding, dimpling and ion milling, successively. TEM observations were carried out with a JEM-2100 microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at a voltage of 200 kV. A Gatan K2 direct detection CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used for image acquisition. It should be noted that the grain size of the as-cast Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn sample was in the range of hundreds of micrometers, and therefore the specimens fabricated for TEM observation were most likely to be from a single grain. The crystal structure of a new phase of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn was determined based on a series of selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. The reflection conditions were summarized according to SAED, which was then indexed to new phase structure parameters. Space group could also be uniquely determined based on reflection conditions.
