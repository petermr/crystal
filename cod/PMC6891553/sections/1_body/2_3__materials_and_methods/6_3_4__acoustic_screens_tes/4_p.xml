<p>The design of the SCASs used in this work was based on those most used one in the field of noise attenuation, which presents great symmetry and simplicity in their design [
 <xref rid="B45-sensors-19-04881" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]: Hollow cylindrical aluminum scatterers arranged in a square array. In order to have a greater variety of SCASs to be tested, two different diameters of the scatterers were considered, i.e., thick SCAS (larger diameter) and thin SCAS (smaller diameter). The design of these SCASs was made to real size and then adjusted to the dimensions of the wind tunnel, applying a scaling coefficient. In this study, the 1 kHz Bragg frequency was considered as the center of the bandgap, as it is the most important band in the normalized traffic noise spectrum [
