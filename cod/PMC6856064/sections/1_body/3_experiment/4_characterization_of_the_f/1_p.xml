<p id="Par26">We evaluated the efficiency of the chip by recording the EL spectra using CAS 140CT (Instrument Systems, Germany) and 500â€‰mm integrating sphere. The forward current to the LEDs was applied using the constant current source K2425 (Keithley). The output characteristics of the fabricated LEDs were evaluated using the CIE and TM-30-18 standards.</p>
