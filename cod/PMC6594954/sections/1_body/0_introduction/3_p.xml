 <sub>8</sub>. The question whether beryllium could experience the same increase in coordination number is of general chemical interest as well as of particular importance for the understanding the nature of Be–O and P–O bonding. While the first experimental observations of P[V] and P[VI] have been recently reported for high-pressure phases of TiPO

 </sup>, the current study appears to the first reporting on the experimental observation of five- and six-fold coordinated beryllium. Here, we present results of high-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) experiments conjoined with ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations that evidence a step-wise transition of Be and P coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral through trigonal bipyramidal.
