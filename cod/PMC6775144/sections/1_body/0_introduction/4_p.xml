<p id="Par5">It is obvious, that the 3D computer image recovery based on any experimental XRDT data is connected equally, if not to a greater extent, with the same difficulties as the interpretation of the XRDT 2D projections on the X-ray diffraction topograms. They are due to the complicated contrast mechanisms of the image formation related to various regions around defects in crystals

 </sup>. In this respect, it is important to find out approximate analytical solutions of the 
 <italic>dynamical</italic> Takagi–Taupin equations, which would allow describing some features of the X-ray diffraction topograms related to particular regions in the neighborhood of single defects in crystals. As is expected, this is a key factor for solving the inverse XRDT problem, in particular, for the 3D recovery of the displacement-field function near around single defects.
