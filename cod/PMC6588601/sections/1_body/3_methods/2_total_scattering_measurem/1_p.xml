<p id="Par27">Neutron total-scattering data were collected at 300 K and 200 K using the Polaris diffractometer at the ISIS facility (Science and Technology Facility Council, UK). The sample powder was loaded in a vanadium can with temperature control achieved using a displex cryostat. The data were processed using the GUDRUN software to obtain the total-scattering function

X-ray total scattering was measured at the 11-ID-B beamline of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) using an incident-beam energy of ≈60 keV with the area detector positioned at 18 cm downstream from the sample. The sample was loaded in a 1 -mm kapton capillary. The X-ray data were processed using the PDFGetX3 software to obtain the corresponding total-scattering function and its Fourier transform (
