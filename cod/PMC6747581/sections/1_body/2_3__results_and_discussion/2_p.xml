<p>Since TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits narrow indirect band gap at the Z1-point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), the VBM is flatter than the first CBM along M-P directions. Note that around Z-point, the VBM is somewhat flatter than the second CBM. Hence, it would appear that electrons are lighter than holes. The effective masses of holes and electrons have been calculated by the finite difference method [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The effective masses of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> calculated by HSE06 are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02667-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For the indirect electronic transition, we found that the effective mass of electrons is 0.196 me (meâ€“a mass of an electron) along the M|X-P direction and the effective mass of holes is 0.736 me along the Z1-M direction. It is interesting to note that Qasrawi et al. used the Hall effect measurement and reported the hole effective mass of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> to be 0.730 me [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is in good agreement with our calculated hole effective mass (0.736 me). For the direct transition, we noted that the EM of electrons is 0.378 me and EM of holes is 0.736 me at Z-point.
