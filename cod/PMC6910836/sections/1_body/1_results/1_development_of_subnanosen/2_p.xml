<p>The sensitivity of SERS strongly depends on the spatial design of the hotspots generated at the gaps between neighboring shell-isolated nanoparticles (SHINs). It is at these gaps that specific surface plasmon resonance phenomena appear in response to laser irradiation, which, in turn, lead to pronounced enhancement of the Raman signals. Therefore, a key aspect of obtaining high-sensitivity Raman data is the successful design and fabrication of the plasmonic amplifiers. For this reason, the present work first performed a theoretical study to optimize the design of the plasmonic amplifiers.</p>
