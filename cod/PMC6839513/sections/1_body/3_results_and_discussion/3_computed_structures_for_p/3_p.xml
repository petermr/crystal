<p>For 
 <bold>form II</bold> (SIP), the best match was initially found with computed structure 10, space group

 <sub>1</sub>/

 <italic>Z</italic> = 4 and 
 <italic>Z</italic>′ = 1. The agreement between computed and experimental lattice parameters was not perfect (

 </xref>), since the computed β angle (99.25° for PBE-TS, 98.41° for PBE-D2) is larger than the experimental value (95.44°). Despite the slight discrepancy in the β angle, the intensities of the experimental GIXD pattern were also reasonably reproduced with this initial results, showing that the crystal structure predicted is substantially correct. By computing the vibrational frequencies, however, we found an imaginary frequency (i.e., a negative eigenvalue), indicating that the 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic>
 <italic>Z</italic>′ = 1 structure corresponds to a saddle point rather than to a genuine energy minimum. The nearby minimum, therefore, was located by repeating the optimization after perturbing the system along the eigenvector of the mode with an imaginary frequency.
