<p>The molecular structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201909423-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) shows a planar As
 <sub>2</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub> ring. A hydrogen atom is attached to each arsenic atom, which additionally coordinates to a W(CO)
 <sub>5</sub> fragment. The W(CO)
 <sub>5</sub> fragments are tilted by 30° out of the plane of the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>As
 <sub>2</sub> ring. The Fe−As distances in 
 <bold>3</bold> (As1‐Fe1 2.4728(7) and As1−Fe1′ 2.4787(8) Å) are slightly shorter than the As−Fe distances in 
 <bold>2</bold> (As1‐Fe1 2.5004(5), As2−Fe1 2.4907(5) Å) but slightly longer than the Fe−As distance in 
 <bold>1</bold> (2.4406(8) Å).
