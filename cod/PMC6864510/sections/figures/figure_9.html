 <caption> a) Stability data for a NFPI 7 EL device tested at a constant current density of 10 mA cm −2. Reproduced with permission. 121 Copyright 2016, Springer Nature. b) EQE versus current density. For the 2:1.9:2 multiple quantum well LEDs, a peak EQE of 12.7% is achieved at a current density of 80 mA cm −2. The EQE of the 2:1.9:2 device remains ≈10% at 500 mA cm −2 due to a significantly suppressed EQE roll‐off.
