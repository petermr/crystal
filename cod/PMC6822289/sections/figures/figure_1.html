 <caption> Structure labels used throughout this work. The structure ID is a progressive counter starting from zero and following the order of insertion into the database (not the chronological order of publication). The charge state of a framework may be neutral (N) or charged (C, needing floating counterions to balance its charge). The first four integers are therefore an index for the reference paper, e.g., p0701, where “p” stands for “paper”. Note that the counting for the IDs starts form zero. </caption>
