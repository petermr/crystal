<p>Seven of the transition metals in the periodic table have the bcc structure, see TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab21" ref-type="table">21</xref>. Of the magnetic elements Fe, Co, and Ni, only iron is bcc. Nanocubes of iron appear to be the only bcc cluster shape synthesized so far [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although the bulk structure of iron is bcc, fcc nanoclusters have been synthesized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This reference also analyzes the thermodynamic stability of the clusters. Here we present 5 bcc cluster shapes and their associated magic formulas.
