This is clearly the case for the short period part of the NWs but also for the long period part, because also in that region we observe clear, though less intense (as predicted by theory), TSL phonon modes. This observation agrees well with our calculated mean free paths of optical phonons of bulk GaP at room temperature, which can be as long as 50 nm. Noticeably, backfolded phonon modes were observed until now in “conventional” heterostructure superlattices with considerably shorter periods than the twin periods probed in this study.

 </sup> The maintenance of coherent phonon propagation over tens of nanometers is the essential requirement for its exploitation in thermal applications based on coherent phonons. Quite remarkably, most of our study, which provides the experimental demonstration of coherent phonons in NWs, was carried out at room temperature, and because already at room temperature we are probing coherent phonons, low temperature conditions, which correspond to a longer phonon mean free path, are not needed to unveil TSL-originated phonon modes.
