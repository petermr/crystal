 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the radiation patterns of the 120° mini-CSPLED, 150° mini-CSPLED, and 180° mini-CSPLED at an injection current of 100 mA. The radiation pattern of mini-CSPLEDs can be controlled by varying the package structures. The 120° mini-CSPLED, 150° mini-CSPLED, and 180° mini-CSPLED viewing angles were measured to be 110.6°, 148.7°, and 180°, respectively. Obviously, the viewing angle of the 180° mini-CSPLED radiation pattern was larger than that of the 120° mini-CSPLED and 150° mini-CSPLED. It can be found that the central light output intensity of the radiation pattern of the 180° mini-CSPLED was depressed to half due to the diffusion reflective layer on the top. The wider viewing angle was caused by much light escape from the transparent layer after being reflected by the diffusion reflective layer, i.e., emission pattern with a butterfly wing-shaped light distribution; thus, it can be used as a planar light source. On the other hand, the 120° mini-CSPLED was covered with a diffusion reflective layer on all four sides, so that the light was concentrated and emitted upwards to form a Lambertian shaped light distribution. In addition, due to the five-sided conformal covered with a transparent layer, the light distribution of the 150° mini-CSPLED was similar to the batwing-shaped light distribution.
