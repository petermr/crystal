<p>Consequently, LumenMax came up with the idea of placing QDs directly on top of an LED chip, describing this structure as a QD‚ÄêLED (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0015" ref-type="fig">15</xref>c). This is a most desirable format because less QD material is required per display, and ease of system integration is maximized. However, this format demands QDs to withstand higher temperatures and excitation fluxes when compared with edge optic and film, and therefore, it requires further material and technological developments.
