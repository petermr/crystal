<p>Also, our Zn(II)-doped spin-coated films made with the 3-CPACl additive remain in its α-phase even after 60 days under ambient conditions. We correlate the prolonged stability under ambient conditions to the combined action of the two additives: the preferential orientation and the grain enlargement induced by the film-forming agent reduces the amount of dangling bonds usually present at the grain boundaries, while the presence of Zn(II) can passivate Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> vacancies and reduce the amount of I
 <sup>–</sup> vacancies by striking the conversion of I
 <sup>–</sup> to I
 <sub>2</sub> in the precursor solution.
