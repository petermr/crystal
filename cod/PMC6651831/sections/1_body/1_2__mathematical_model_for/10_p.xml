<p>Based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values exhibited similar trends for both configurations. The maximum values appearred at rotation angles between 75 and 85 degrees. The change in fiber volume fraction under a constant rotation angle had a minor influence on the Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values. The maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values in configuration I were 0.29 and 34 K, while the values of maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> in configuration II were 0.22 and 27 K. These results indicate a 26% difference in the peak thermoelectric performance among the two configurations. Hence, the alignment of the material’s local property coordinates with respect to the composite coordinate system had significant influence on the composite’s cooling performance.
