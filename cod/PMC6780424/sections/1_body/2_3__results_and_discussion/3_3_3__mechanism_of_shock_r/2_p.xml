<p>In order to study the mechanism of the initiation of shock reaction, we calculated for the 11 crystals the strength of the trigger bond 
 <italic>S
  <sub>trigger</sub>
 </italic> and the temperature rising rate (TRR) under shock, as shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In this, the bond strength was quantified by the integrated value of the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) at band energy, and the temperature rising rate was calculated by dividing the temperature (when t = 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic>) by 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic>.
