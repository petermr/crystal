<p>The chemical titration was made after dissolution of the powder in NaOH aqueous solution within the presence of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> and KI salt dissolved in large excess in regard to the tungsten trioxide concentration. A redox process between MnO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions and then between the rest of MnO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and I
 <sup>−</sup> lead to the formation of I
 <sub>2</sub> species, which can be titrated by Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> in order to get W
 <sup>5+</sup> concentration, and then to deduce the oxygen sub-stoichiometry in WO
 <sub>3-x</sub> compounds (x equals half time the W
 <sup>5+</sup> concentration). All reagents were provided by Merck, Darmstadt, GERMANY.
