 <caption> Evolution of lattice parameters in PbTi 1â€“ x V x O 3 as a function of x. The rapidly increasing c and slowly decreasing a result in unusual enhancement in c/ a value. The inset shows the octahedral environment changes into pyramidal one due to increase in tetragonal distortion with increasing x. </caption>
