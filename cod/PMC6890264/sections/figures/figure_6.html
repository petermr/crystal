 <caption> (a,b) Hexagonal close-packed structure viewed from two different orientations: (a) characteristic arrangement into hexagonally constructed layers, defined here as the x, y-plane, and (b) characteristic ...ABAB... stacking of these hexagonal layers, defined here as the x, z-plane. (c,d) Anion positions of (black) low-chalcocite Cu 2– x S, (cyan) wurtzite CuGaS 2, and (purple) α′-Ga 2S 3 overlaid onto each other. (c) Hexagonal ordering in the x, y-plane and (d) ...ABAB... stacking in the x, z-plane. Δ x, Δ y, and Δ z, denoted in (a,b), correspond to the lattice distances used to determine the lattice contractions mentioned in the main text. The x, y, z-directions correspond to the following crystallographic directions: (low-chalcocite Cu 2– x S) [201],[010],[001]; (wurtzite CuGaS 2) [11̅0],[110],[001]; (monoclinic α′-Ga 2S 3) [010],[100],[102]. Anion coordinates were obtained from the crystal structures of low-chalcocite Cu 2– x S, 34 wurtzite CuGaS 2, 44 and monoclinic α′-Ga 2S 3. 46 </caption>
