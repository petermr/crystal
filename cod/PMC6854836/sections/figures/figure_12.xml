  <p>Ground-state diagram at 0 K for α-SiB
   <sub>3–
    <italic>x</italic>
   </sub>, where 
   <italic>x</italic> = 0.5, 0.18, 0, −0.2, and −0.67 in relation to thermodynamically stable β-SiB
   <sub>3</sub>. The red crosses are the DFT calculated formation energies of the 1019 configurations (up to a supercell size of 42 atoms), which were included in the cluster expansion.
