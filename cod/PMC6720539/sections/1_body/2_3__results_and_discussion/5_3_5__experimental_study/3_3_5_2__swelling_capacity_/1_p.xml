<p>The hydration performance of montmorillonite includes swelling capacity and gelling value. The swelling capacity refers to the volume of montmorillonite after expansion in dilute hydrochloric acid solution. The gelling value is a comprehensive expression including the dispersibility, hydrophilicity, and swelling ability of the montmorillonite. Both of them can be used to characterize the hydration expansion properties of montmorillonite.</p>
