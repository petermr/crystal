<p>Poly/microcrystalline bulk samples and single-crystal samples of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> have a different composition. The composition of single crystals is closer to the ideal, electron-precise, composition SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub>. Electronic structure calculations yield band gaps of similar size for α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, around 2 eV. Experimentally obtained α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> (0.1 &lt; 
 <italic>x</italic> &lt;0.45) should correspond to a p-type conductor. However, the electron transport properties of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> are yet unknown, and it will be important to characterize them, along with other physical properties, to assess its potential as a technologically significant material.
