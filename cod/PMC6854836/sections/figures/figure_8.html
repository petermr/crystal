 <caption> Rietveld fit to PXRD patterns (Cu Kα radiation) of β-SiB 3 (obtained from reaction pellets micron-Si/B = 1:2 which were annealed at 1200 °C for 2 weeks) (a) and α-SiB 3– x (as obtained from a reaction pellet nano-Si/B = 1:3 after sintering at 1250 °C for 16 h) (b). See Tables 1 and 2 for the refinement results. Secondary phases included in the refinements are Si (a, b) and SiB 6 (b). </caption>
