<p id="Par16">One of the HPT-processed disks was cut along the diameter and the vertical cross-sectional surfaces of two semi-circular disks were polished mechanically to mirror-like conditions. One of these surfaces was etched with Keller’s etchant for microstructural observations using an optical microscope equipped with a Vickers hardness tester, Mitutoyo HM-200. The other polished surface was unetched and it was used to measure the Vickers microhardness values at intervals of 0.15 mm in a grid pattern with a load of 50 gf (0.49 N) and a dwell time of 10 s.</p>
