   <bold>e</bold> XPS measurement results that show the Y/Pb ratios on the surface of CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) films with different YCl
   <sub>3</sub> ratios of 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. The Y/Pb ratios on the film surface is higher than the corresponding Y/Pb ratios in the precursor solutions.
