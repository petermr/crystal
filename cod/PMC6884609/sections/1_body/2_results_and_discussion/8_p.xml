<p id="Par23">Besides the effect of diameter, nanoplates with different thicknesses are also considered. The potential energy of the nanoplate (
 <italic>d</italic> = 32
 <italic>a</italic>) with different layers are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Note that the aforementioned 3-atomic-layer nanoplate is also shown for comparison. As seen from the evolution of the potential energies, it is found that the nanoplates with 1 or 2 atomic layers experience obviously more stages comparing to the one with 3 layers. Actually, they collapse to irregular shapes at much lower temperatures. In contrast, the original structure of the nanoplate with 4 layers is well maintained until 97 K (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). However, at 98 K, its disc-like (001) planes transform into elliptical (110) planes with higher stability (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which is accompanied with abrupt decrease in potential energy. This generated 4-layer (110) nanoplate retains its configuration until melting occurs. These results show that thicker nanoplates generally present better stability, and the saddle shape only exists at relatively small thicknesses. For further insights into the generality of the evolution patterns, we also modeled several other bcc metallic (including W, Nb, Mo, and Cr) nanoplates with diameters of 32
 <italic>a</italic>, which consist of three layers of (001) orientated atoms initially. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> illustrates the temperature-dependent potential energies of these nanoplates and the associated atomistic snapshots at representative temperatures. After relaxation at 1 K, all the originally uniform (001) planes reconstruct and form (110) facets with different orientations. At lower temperatures, the saddle shape, as a universal metastable state, appears in every nanoplate, similar to the case of Fe nanoplate. With the heating progressing, the transformation into an irregular particle occurs at different temperatures, where the potential energies sharply decrease. Comparatively, the saddle shape stage for W nanoplate lasts in the widest temperature range (until 582 K), which is attributed to its extraordinary structural stability (initial 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>p</sub> = − 7.94 eV/atom). In contrast, the least stable Cr nanoplate maintains its saddle shape only until 62 K, after which the bumping and buckling successively appear (cf. the snapshots taken at 61 and 250 K in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As for the other two nanoplates, Nb tends to restore the original flat surface (cf. the snapshot of 135 K in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), and Mo presents significant bending (cf. the snapshot of 150 K) before their final collapse. These two situations roughly resemble the modulated (110) and (001) Fe nanoplates. The above results show that the metastable states observed in the Fe nanoplates also exist in other bcc metallic nanoplates. Configurations with different structural stability follow different evolution patterns. In addition, it is noted that in most of our simulations, nanoplates transform into compact particles even below the room temperature, which is resulted from their small sizes. Still, the identified evolution mechanisms are of general significance. The results of the relative stability of these nanoplates between different plane orientations, sizes, and elements could be extrapolated to larger systems. The description of shape transformation mechanisms can serve as a reference for obtaining desired morphologies through crystalline orientation controlling or alloying [
