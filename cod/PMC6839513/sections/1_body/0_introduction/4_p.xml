<p>The characterization of a thin solid layer grown at a solid surface is challenging, and this is especially true if the structure, i.e., the assembly of the molecules within the unit cell, is unknown. To solve the structure of thin films from a few monolayers up to some hundreds of nanometers, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) is, besides electron diffraction, a method applicable. In short, diffraction from crystals gives reciprocal space information (peak positions and intensities). Peak positions determine the unit cell of the crystal, while the intensities provide structure information, i.e., the location of the atoms within the unit cell. Obtaining a direct solution is complicated due to the problem of lost phase information. Computer aided construction enables access to structural information either by direct or indirect methods. This approach works very well for most small molecular or macromolecular crystals, but, because of its statistical nature, many Bragg peaks are required for succeeding. Unfortunately, measuring GIXD or even electron diffraction provides often a limited number of Bragg reflections because of, for instance, too weak diffraction, small scattering volume, high aspect ratio or defects in the sample besides experimental damping resulting from temperature vibration (Debye–Waller like damping), or polarization of the X-ray beam. This restricts the usage of conventional structure solving approaches otherwise suitable for large single crystals.</p>
