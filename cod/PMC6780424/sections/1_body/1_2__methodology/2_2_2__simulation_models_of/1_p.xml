<p>CL-20 has been proven to show excellent performance since it was first synthesized by the Naval Air Warfare Center China Lake 30 years ago [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; however, it has not been widely used until now because of the sensitivity problems of its ε, β, γ and ζ polymorphs [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cocrystallization, which mixes several components on a molecular level, has been considered a promising technique to obtain advanced EMs with good detonation performance and low sensitivity to accidental initiation. Under that circumstance, five novel cocrystals—CL-20/H
 <sub>2</sub>O, CL-20/TNT, CL-20/1,3-dinitrobenzene (CL-20/DNB), CL-20/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and CL-20/HMX, have been recently synthesized.
