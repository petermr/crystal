 <caption> Lead-free perovskite nanomaterials based down-conversion LEDs. ( a) Schematic representation of the synthesis of the 2D (OCTAm) 2SnBr 4 by a facile aqueous acid-based synthetic method in ambient air. ( b) Images of yellow phosphors, blue/green phosphors, and their blends with different ratios embedded in PS films under sunlight (top panel) and 365 nm UV light (bottom panel). The first row in each panel are a yellow–blue phosphor mixture, and the second is a yellow–blue–green mixture. ( c) Chromaticity coordinates of different ratios of the phosphor mixture plotted on the CIE1931 chromaticity chart: Blue phosphor (square), yellow phosphor (round), yellow–blue phosphor 4:1 (triangle), and yellow–blue–green phosphor 4:1:1.5 (star).

( e) Normalized absorption (Abs), PL excitation (PLE, monitored at 620 nm), and PL (excited by 365 nm) spectra of the (OAm) 2SnBr 4 perovskite film. Reproduced with permission [ 75]. Copyright American Chemical Society, 2019. ( f) Absorption and photoluminescence spectra of CsBr:Eu 2+ NCs. The inset depicts the optical images of the NCs dispersed in hexane with and without illumination by a 365 nm UV lamp. ( g) EL spectra and of the white LED operated under different forward bias currents. Reproduced with permission [ 77]. Copyright WILEY-VCH Verlag, GmbH &amp; Co.
