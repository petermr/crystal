<p>Adsorption of monatomic ions to the zabuyelite surface would not be expected to produce their own bands in the IR spectrum. However, changing the chemistry of carbonate nearest cation neighbors produces a measurable difference in the stretching modes of carbonate.

 </sup> Therefore, the spectral position of the carbonate asymmetrical stretch was assessed using ATR-IR. Sulfate band positions were compared with a 0.33 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution without any zabuyelite (

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>c). In all experiments, the same broad bands were observed at 740, 858, 1087, and 1407 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> in the solid phase consistent with the DRIFTS analysis. Sulfate in solution produced an intense band at 1096 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> that is related to the asymmetrical stretch of the tetrahedral sulfate oxyanion.

 </sup> Zabuyelite crystals that are exposed to a 0.33 M sulfate solution show a shift of this band to 1110 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
