 </sup> Compared to the experimental and DFT calculated values, our FF gives a slightly smaller lattice cell. The lattice parameters were predicted to be 5.64, 15.55, and 8.24 Å for a, b, and c axis, respectively. The lengths of a, b, and c decreases by about 0.08, 0.30, and 0.18 Å, or 1.4, 1.9, and 2.1%, respectively, and the lattice angle β varies little, which is predicted to be 100.96°. Because of the little shorter axis, the lattice volume is reduced from 748 Å
 <sup>3</sup> to 711 Å
 <sup>3</sup>, by about 5.0%. Although our FF gives a smaller volume, the molecular position and orientation are in good agreement with the experimental measurements.
 <sup>

 </sup> Because of the symmetry, the position is described with the fraction coordinate of the centroid of a chosen molecule, and the orientation is expressed with three angles between 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic> axis and the vector from N3 to N4 on the molecule. In the result from the FF, the position is predicted to be (0.560, 0.869, and 0.549) for the molecule, which are very similar with (0.559, 0.867, and 0.553) from the experiment.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 </sup> Also the orientation angles are simulated to be (145.65, 67.38, and 114.38°), which are consistent with those from experimental measures.
