<p>Unlike the divalent ions, the monovalent ions examined here are expected only to form solvent-mediated interactions with the components of zabuyelite. Complexation with Na
 <sup>+</sup> may be important at low temperatures particularly for brines where Na
 <sup>+</sup> concentrations are typically higher than 5 wt %.

 </sup> However, our PHREEQC calculations indicate that the influence of monovalent cations such as Na
 <sup>+</sup> is lowered by increasing the temperature of the precipitating system. Chlorine is predicted to form less ion pairs with Li
 <sup>+</sup> in solution. Therefore, the presence of monovalent anions may be beneficial for altering the hydration of the growing surface and Li
 <sup>+</sup> in solution. For predictions of the effectiveness of Li extraction, thermodynamic data for the formation of the important Li-carbonate ion pairs and zabuyelite would be invaluable and should be targeted in future studies.
