 <caption> Coexistence of the smectic-A (Sm-A) and stacked hexatic (Hex-B) phases in a 54COOBC compound. ( a, b) Examples of the in-plane diffraction from the Sm-A phase ( a) and Hex-B phase ( b); ( câ€“ f) spatially resolved maps of the BO order parameter C 6. The color code indicates the normalized intensity of the scattered X-rays. The white dashed line in ( d, e) separates regions of Sm-A (blue) and Hex-B (green) phases. (adopted from Zaluzhnyy et al.
