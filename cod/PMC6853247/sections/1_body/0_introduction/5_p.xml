<p>In this study, we report an extensive characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of lamellae of Anh‐B formed in a sample of polycrystalline olivine annealed at 14 GPa, 1400 °C. Structure refinement is performed from processing three‐dimensional precession electron diffraction data. The structure model is complemented by chemical analysis by energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS), and silicon coordination is characterized by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses. From this structure model, first‐principles atomic scale calculations are carried out to investigate the stability of this phase and to determine its elastic properties, and then its seismic properties.</p>
