<p id="Par46">The calculated EOSs of coesite-IV and coesite-V phases of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) show good agreement with the experiment. Calculated bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives are summarized in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>. In particular, our theoretical results predict that coesite-IV and coesite-V phases of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> are much softer than stishovite/CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>-type silica and seifertite.
