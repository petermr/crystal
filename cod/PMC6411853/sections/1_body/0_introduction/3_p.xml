 </sup>. However, no experimental investigation concerning structure and physical properties of BiI
 <sub>3</sub> monosheets are available. One standard way to prepare a thin film of a layered material is cleaving the bulk crystal which in the case of BiI
 <sub>3</sub> consists of weakly van-der-Waals (vdW) connected sheets. Its disadvantage is that this method neither allows precise control of the film thickness nor the preparation of a single monosheet. Furthermore, handling of bulk BiI
 <sub>3</sub> is hindered due to its notable moisture-sensitivity.
