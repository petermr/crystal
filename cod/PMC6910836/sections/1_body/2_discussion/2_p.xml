<p>Subnanosensitive spectroscopic methods elaborated in this study demonstrate its applicability to detect subnanomaterials with extremely small surface concentration. However, it is still conditional with the current method that SNCs get into the focus of the hotspots to give Raman signals in the Raman spectra. The probability of the measurements can be improved by further spatial design of the hotspots with tuning of the shape and the size of amplifiers. For instance, the introduction of star-shaped amplifiers may increase the density of hotspots on the surface, improving the probability of the measurements.</p>
