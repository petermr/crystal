<p>The displacement pattern associated with the B
 <sub>3g</sub> phonon mode corresponds to a shearing motion along the b direction. The A
 <sub>g</sub> phonon mode is associated with displacement in the crystallographic c axis. It can be clearly seen that A
 <sub>g</sub> and B
 <sub>3g</sub> exhibit softening near the phase transition pressure at 34 GPa. This pressure-induced softening of the low-frequency symmetric mode can be found in other second-order phase transitions [

 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. From the results, it is evident that a second-order phase transition takes place, with the transition of crystal symmetry from a simple orthorhombic phase (
 <italic>Pnma</italic>) to a high, centered orthorhombic phase (
 <italic>Cmcm</italic>). The phase transition is a displacement type induced by the softening of the low-frequency interlayer phonon mode.
