<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, after the various studies about the properties of piezoelectric materials transducers’ PZT transducers were the best to use in harvesting vibrations produced from different kinds of mechanical energies and therefore sound energy as if formed a kind of mechanical energy. Liew Hui Fanga study’s titled with 
 <italic>Characterization of Different Dimension Piezoelectric Transducer for Sound Wave Energy Harvesting</italic> made an investigation experiment as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219373.g001">Fig 1</xref> using a various type of piezoelectric transducers based on energy harvesting system to convert environmental acoustic vibration (noise/ sound) into electric energy. The varieties of piezoelectric transducer structures are targeted to resonate at the ambient frequency which is below 1 kHz. The experimented sound level of the piezoelectric is at the range of 35–100 dB. It is comparable with ambience environmental human sound of level 50 dB to 100 dB.
