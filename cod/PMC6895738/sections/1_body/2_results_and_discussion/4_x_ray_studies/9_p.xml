<p id="p0130">In 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> the dependences of the parameters and the cell volume of the sample NCN0.25 on the temperature are shown. It can be seen that the parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> of the intermediate phase R2 in the wide range of its existence remains the same – 61.83 Å. At heating in the region of coexistence of the R1 and R2 phases, the parameters 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> and the cell volume of both phases also do not change – it is typical for the morphotropic phase transition in solid solutions [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the region of coexistence of R2 and R3 phases during heating, only parameters 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>, which are the same in both phases, increase abruptly at 423 and 403 K, respectively. There are no other features on temperature dependencies. In the process of cooling, the dependences repeat the shape of the heating curves, but pass slightly lower than them till 
 <italic>T</italic> = 393 K. At 383 K, all the parameters and volumes of the cell of the R2 and R3 phases increase, and are exceed their values at heating.
