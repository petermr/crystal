<p content-type="flushleft">We investigate the mode of quinoline-family drug action within 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected red blood cells. We have conducted a quantitative measurement of in vivo distribution of the antimalarial drug BrQ within fully hydrated, rapidly frozen, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cells in the trophozoite stage. These cells are not subject to any artifact deriving from dehydration, staining, chemical fixation, or sectioning and thus provide the closest scenario to an unperturbed biological picture of the drug intervention in the infected red blood cells. Native distribution of chemical elements was measured in the vitrified infected cells at specific time points of parasitic development and drug action.
