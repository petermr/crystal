<p id="Par34">We compare the above3D displacement-field function recovery results with the corresponding ones by using the nonlinear qNGD algorithm based on the Levenberg–Marquardt scheme

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Further, one utilizes the open access NL2SNO program code as an implementation of the qNGD algorithm (see
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> for details). The corresponding optimization results of the target function (
 <xref rid="Equ13" ref-type="">13</xref>) obtained by the qNGD algorithm are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. It is seen that for the spatial grids, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>.: {15, 15, 1–6|
 <bold>7</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold>|10–15} and {15, 15, 1–5|
 <bold>6</bold>–
 <bold>10</bold>|11–15}, the final target function values of order of 10
 <sup>−22</sup> and the error parameter CP ones of the order of 5 · 10
 <sup>−5</sup> are obtained. It should be noted that in the case of the spatial grid {15, 15, 15}, the values of the error parameter CP are much more than the initial error CP ones due to the solution ambiguity of the inverse XRDT problem under consideration.
