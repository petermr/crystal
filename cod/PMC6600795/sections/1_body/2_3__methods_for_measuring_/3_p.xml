<p>In the analysis of a crystal, we have a deterministic signal, the crystal structure in the undeformed condition, and then the deformed structure caused by a loading process. The microscope produces an image of the atom positions in both configurations. It is possible to use also two approaches, measuring changes of distances in the crystalline configuration, utilizing basic parameters of the crystal atoms or a field approach applying fringe analysis techniques (for example, [

 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). In the present study, the authors have selected a specimen to analyze a crystal that contained dislocations and experience deformations under the state of residual stresses produced by the presence of dislocations. The specimen was a thin crystal wafer of about 10 nm thickness under a state of plane-residual-stresses.
