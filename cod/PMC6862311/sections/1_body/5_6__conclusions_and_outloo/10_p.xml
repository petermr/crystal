<p>AXCCA has been developed to investigate the structure of partially ordered systems, to detect hidden symmetries and weak angular correlations. These include various complex fluids, polymer melts, colloids, liquid crystals, suspensions of biological molecules, block copolymers and mesocrystals. Having in mind the astonishing achievements in the synthesis of new molecules of almost any shape and sequences, there are no doubts that in the near future a great number of new substances will appear, the properties of which are hard to imagine at the present time. The various types of orientational order should be an essential feature of newly synthesized materials. Thus, the role of AXCCA as a unique tool in X-ray studies of orientational order and angular correlations will only increase with time.</p>
