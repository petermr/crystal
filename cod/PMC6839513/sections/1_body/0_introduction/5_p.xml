<p>In this work, we demonstrate that a full structure solution can be obtained from GIXD data, despite their limitations. To gain access to the structure of our sample of interest, phenytoin

 </xref>). The computationally generated structures can thus be used to produce theoretical diffraction patterns to compare to the experiments, finally allowing identification of the solution with the best match. This approach is demonstrated here in detail on the exemplary case of the recently found phenytoin thin film phase (
 <bold>form II</bold>). It is known that this phase

 </sup> shows an improved drug release rate compared to the bulk polymorph counterpart, but the previous studies could not clarify why this difference exists. The knowledge of the structure gained in this work suggests that, in addition to differences in the crystal habit, also packing variations can explain the enhanced dissolution rate.
