<p>Vibrational studies of α-B
 <sub>12</sub>- and α-B
 <sub>12</sub>-derived refractories have been previously undertaken for investigating fundamental bonding properties of complex structured, “electron-deficient”, solids as well as for analyzing structural disorder and imperfections in these materials.
