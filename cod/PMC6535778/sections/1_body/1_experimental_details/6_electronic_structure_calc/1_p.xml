<p>The bulk electronic structure calculations for EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> were performed by using the projector augmented wave method as implemented in the VASP package within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme.

 </sup> The experimental structural parameters were employed. Spin–orbit coupling was included self-consistently in some of the calculations for comparison to the expected electronic structure with SOC absent. Spin polarization using GGA+

 </sup> How f electron states are treated in DFT calculations is of interest because when considered as valence electrons then they are always found at the Fermi energy for partly filled f orbitals, which, except in very rare cases such as for heavy fermion materials,

 </sup> is not a realistic picture for their relative position in energy—in our calculations, the energies of the calculated Eu f electron states are tested to match with the experimental ARPES measurements. A Monkhorst–Pack 11 × 11 × 7

 <italic>k</italic>-space integrations.

 </sup> With these settings, the calculated total energy converged to less than 0.1 meV per atom. For the surface spectral weight calculations, a semi-infinite Green’s function method, terminated by (001) surfaces, was employed. Calculations were made for Sn-, P-, and Eu-terminated (001) surfaces. The median line of the Sn bilayer is selected as the Sn-terminated surface.
