<p>Several kinds of QDs have been synthesized, such as CdS [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], CdTe [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], ZnS [
 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and their composites [
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, some of them contain toxic elements in themselves. The tin oxide (SnO
 <sub>2</sub>) QD is an environment-friendly semiconductor. It has the advantages of non-toxicity, chemical stability and low cost. Based on the optical characteristics, SnO
 <sub>2</sub> photoluminescence sensors were developed for xanthene dyes [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], DNA [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and 1,4 Bis ((2-Methyl) thio) Phenylamino methyl benzene Schiff [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, there have been few reports of heavy metal ion detection by SnO
 <sub>2</sub> sensors. There are some techniques to prepare SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs. However, the organic reagents of oleic acid, toluene, oleylamine and hydrazine need to be used in the fabrication [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The organic compounds are harmful to human beings and the environment. They also increase the risk of operator poisoning and the cost of environmental remediation in factories. Therefore, it is expected to find a route to prepare SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs with simple, cheap and environment-friendly fabrication. Furthermore, these SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs are potentially applicable to the detection of heavy metal ions in contaminated water.
