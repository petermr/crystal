<p>The solution-phase photolysis of 
 <italic>trans-</italic>[Cr(PetA)(ONO)
 <sub>2</sub>]BF
 <sub>4</sub> was examined using the Sievers NOA to evaluate the photolability of this photoNORM toward NO release. The NOA determines with high sensitivity and precision the NO that is swept from the photolysis solution with an entraining gas (either He or medical-grade air). For PetACrONO, photoactivated NO release was readily apparent as has been shown previously for the photolysis of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Cr(cyclam)(ONO)
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> (“CrONO”, cyclam = l,4,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane). Earlier studies showed CrONO to undergo reversible CrO–NO bond homolysis to give NO and a Cr(IV) intermediate (

 </sup> Quantum yields of NO release (Φ
 <sub>NO</sub>) were relatively insensitive to excitation wavelength over the range of 365–436 nm with values in the range of 0.18–0.28 over various conditions.

 </sup> Photolysis at 546 nm gave comparable photochemistry, despite the very low extinction coefficients at this wavelength

 </disp-formula>Similarly, 451 nm photolysis of an isobutyronitrile solution of PetACrONO (0.5 mM) led to NO release as detected with the NOA. Medical-grade air was the entraining gas, and the quantitative analysis of the NO released during short defined photolysis intervals gave a Φ
 <sub>NO</sub> value of 0.32 ± 0.01 (

 <italic>trans-</italic>Cr(PetA)(ONO)
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> cation are comparable to those of CrONO itself.

 </sup> Thus, the introduction of phenyl and methyl groups to the cyclam ring and switching to a less polar medium did not inhibit the overall photolability of PetACrONO toward NO release. Analogous photolysis of PetACrONO in acetonitrile solvent using 365 nm excitation gave a similar result (Φ
 <sub>NO</sub> = 0.30 ± 0.01).
