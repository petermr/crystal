<p>To comprehensively reveal the influence of material microstructure on surface topography and analyze its characteristic, Ding et al. conducted orthogonal cutting experiments with a small diamond micro-tool to machine aluminium alloy Al6016 and polycrystalline copper on a vibration-controlled ultraprecision machine tool (Moore Nanotech 350, Moore Nanotechnology Systems, LLC, Swanzey, NH, USA) [

 <xref rid="B114-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. They found that for the aluminium alloy, the hard particles embedded in the material matrix are brittle, which is responsible for the void and scratch line on the machined surface [

Meanwhile, for the polycrystalline copper, few hard particles are found on the material matrix, while the grain boundary relevant step structure (not the wrinkled structures on the chip) is clearly observed on the cutting chips in
