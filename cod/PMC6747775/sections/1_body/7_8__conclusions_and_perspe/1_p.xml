<p>NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and KAlH
 <sub>4</sub> stand out among all of the alanates due to their acceptable hydrogen content and reversibility. Perhaps for light-duty vehicles applications, an option will be the NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, where the catalyst performance is essential. In that subject, along with the consulted papers, the Ti-based catalyst could be limited in the long-term because of the progressive change in the oxidation state of Ti, associated with the decay of performance. Perhaps, lanthanide-metals compounds could be the solution. However, more research on extensive cycling must be done: There is not enough data up to now on the long-term performance of Ce-catalysts on NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>. On the other hand, KAlH
 <sub>4</sub> can be suitable for niche applications where the high-temperature dehydrogenation is not an issue. However, there is no data regarding extensive cycling.
