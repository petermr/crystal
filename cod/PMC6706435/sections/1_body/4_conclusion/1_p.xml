<p id="Par45">The proposed in this work interpretation of the experimental data on the distribution of electrical conductivity at the detonation of condensed HEs is analyzed using statistical criteria. The degree of reliability supports the consistency of the hypothesis on the influence of the grain size of HE on the structure of charge and the chemical reaction zone in the whole range of densities investigated. Results of the work agree well with both the data of numerical simulations and the experimental results.</p>
