 <caption> Ball and stick models of (a) the optimum TiO 2(011)-(2 Ã— 1) geometry and (b) the ideal bulk terminated TiO 2(011) structure. Large light blue (small red) spheres are oxygen (titanium) atoms. The numerical labeling of the atoms is employed in Tables 1 and S1 for the identification purposes. Symmetry paired atoms are denoted by an asterisk (*). </caption>
