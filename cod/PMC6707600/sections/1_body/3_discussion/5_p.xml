<p>In the present study, internal femoral changes in the chondrogenic stage and subsequent endochondral ossification were successfully detected by changing the signal intensity at the diaphysis and metaphysis. We could evaluate the correlation with histological and MRI findings using embryonic rat samples (

The data indicated that the histological findings corresponding to phase 4 according to Streeter’s classification showed low signal intensity compared with phases 1–3, whereas the histological findings corresponding to phase 5 showed high signal intensity (

Considering that fluids such as blood and extracellular fluid collections exhibit high signal intensity on MRI, the difference in signal intensity between phases 4 and 5 might have resulted from the influx of blood flow and degeneration of cartilage cells at phase 5. The change in phase 4 and 5 regions could have followed; that is, phase 4 and 5 regions were first detected at the center of the diaphysis in fetuses with a CRL of 37.5 mm, which moved from the central part of the diaphysis to the metaphysis. Phase 4 and 5 regions became narrow, which might become the epiphyseal cartilage plate in larger fetuses.
