<p>The presence of water molecules (in coordinated and uncoordinated states) in the metal complexes induced the broadening of the bands at ~3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The axial coordination of a water molecule to each metal center was supported by the observation of bands at about 500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>.
