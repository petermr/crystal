 <p>A type of wind speed sensor system is designed and fabricated for wind speed detection by integrating a wind‐driven triboelectrification‐induced electroluminescence (TIEL) component with a perovskite‐based photodetector (PD). This research not only provides essential progress toward an environmentally friendly light source but also demonstrates a practical application of TIEL‐related sensor systems.
