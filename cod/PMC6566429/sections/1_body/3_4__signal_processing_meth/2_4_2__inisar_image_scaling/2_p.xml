<p>Unlike SAR image, in most cases, a high-frequency small-rotation angle ISAR image of a moving target usually consists of several dominating reflectors, such as corner reflectors formed by the tail, fuselage, and wings of an aircraft. The pixels of these dominating scatterers have stronger SNR and more accurate interferometric phase value than the weak ones. In this paper, we achieve the cross-range scaling of all scatterers based on the phases of these dominating scatterers to estimate the rotation rate of target rather than the conventional phase unwrapping operation. Once the rotational rate is obtained, the cross-range coordinates can be determined directly based on the cross-range-Doppler relationship.</p>
