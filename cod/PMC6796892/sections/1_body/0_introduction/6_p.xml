<p>In the present work, we have shown that the V substitution in PTO can induce magnetism, which can lead to multiferroicity in the substituted system. Thus, our ultimate aim to design magnetoelectric materials from nonmagnetic system is satisfied. The coupling between the electric- and magnetic-order parameters is strong due to the presence of two ferroelectric mechanisms (lone pair of Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> as well as d
 <sup>0</sup>-ness of Ti
 <sup>4+</sup>). The 2D magnetism arises in PVO due to the d
 <sub>
  <italic>xy</italic>
 </sub>-type orbital ordering in the ferroelectric ground state. On the other hand, the disorder induced by the substitution may release the frustration in PVO, which can lead to a long-range magnetic ordering. We hope the substitution could reduce the tendency of the system to form a 2D arrangement of V cations, which may lead to form three-dimensional (3D) magnetic ordering.
