<p>The XRD spectra of nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> synthesized at different temperatures are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f004">Figure 4</xref>. In the XRD spectra, the characteristic peak of the anatase phase appears in TiO
 <sub>2</sub> after calcination at 400 °C, but the peak pattern is weak, indicating that the crystal is not complete and only partially transformed into the anatase phase. TiO
 <sub>2</sub> annealed at 500 °C shows a complete anatase diffraction peak, and the main peaks appear at the angles of 2θ at 25.18°, 37.90°, 48.09°, 53.96°, 62.71°, 69.12°, 70.30° and 75.00°, respectively, corresponding to the crystal planes of the anatase phase being (101), (004), (200), (105), (204), (220), (215), respectively. The results show that the amorphous TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is completely transformed from amorphous to anatase (JCPDS No. 021/1272) [

 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. After being calcinated at 700 °C and 800 °C, the rutile diffraction peak (2θ at 27.34° and other positions) appears. The peak pattern becomes particularly sharp after calcination at 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C, reflecting the increase of grain size after calcination at higher temperatures. The grain size is calculated by the Scherrer formula.

 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the grain sizes of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> after calcination at 400 °C and 500 °C are 8.4 and 9.6 nm. When the temperature continues to increase, the grain size begins to increase greatly. This phenomenon is consistent with that in the studies of Rajesh et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Phoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], who reported that the grain size of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> increased with the increase of calcination temperature from 523 K to 1023 K. Generally speaking, anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> has good photocatalytic activity, while rutile has higher stability. In this paper, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> calcined at 500 °C has a complete anatase phase and small grain size.
