 </sup> Even though the maximum reported purities in these works (95%) are slightly lower than ours, it is worth mentioning that these studies used maximum calcination temperatures of 800 °C, whereas our second batch is prepared at a calcination temperature of 850 °C. As it has been clearly demonstrated in this study, this difference in temperature can lead to an increase of ferrite conversion. On the other hand, all works agree on the formation of the tetragonal phase of CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> in the studied temperature range.
