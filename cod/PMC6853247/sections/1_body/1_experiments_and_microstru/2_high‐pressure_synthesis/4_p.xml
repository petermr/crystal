<p>The pressure was calibrated as function of hydraulic oil pressure using the experimental results on the olivine‐wadsleyite transformation (P = 14 GPa at T = 1400 °C) by Katsura et al. (

 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). Temperature within the sample did not vary by more than ~30 K. In the experiment reported here, pressure was increased to 14 GPa over a period of 5 hr. After reaching the desired pressure, temperature was increased rapidly to 1400 °C (&gt;100 °C per min). The sample was then annealed at 1400 °C for 30 min.
