 </sup> was to combine the complementary structural information contained within eight distinct experimental data sets—spanning neutron and X-ray scattering, diffraction and element-specific X-ray absorption measurements, real- and reciprocal-space normalisations, for both powder and single-crystal samples—to arrive at a single consistent structural model of PMN. For context, most previous complex modelling studies—whether of PMN or of entirely separate systems—have included at most two or three data sets. The step-change here was made possible by a recent optimised implementation of the complex modelling code

 </sup>, which used the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm to construct of a 320,000-atom representation of the PMN structure consistent with the entire ensemble of input data. The hierarchical nature of the PMN structure is illustrated and described in Fig.
