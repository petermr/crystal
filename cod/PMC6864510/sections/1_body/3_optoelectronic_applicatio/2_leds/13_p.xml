<p>We summarized the annually reported highest efficiency of 2D and 3D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite–based LEDs in recent years (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>h). The EQE of 2D perovskite–based LEDs has a rapid development from 9.6% to 20.1% for green and near‐infrared emissions in just 3 years, and the current efficiency already approaches the level of 3D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite–based LEDs. Apparently, 2D perovskites have a good prospect in LEDs.
