<p>In order to observe a larger radius, the symmetry centers of the patterns in Fig. 8
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref> were shifted off the image center, and the measured distributions were symmetrized. The electric vector of the incoming X-ray beam is oriented 22° off the surface normal. The as-measured data show that this symmetry breaking has only a minor effect on the observed patterns. The initial directional characteristic is ‘washed out’ by the multiple-scattering processes, hence the diffractograms reflect essentially the sixfold symmetry of the Re (0001) crystal. The same argument holds for the action of the photon momentum, which was crucial in the direct transitions from the valence-bands. Here the fingerprint of the photon momentum is absent and the center of the XPD pattern coincides with the symmetry axis of the crystal, here the [0001] direction.
