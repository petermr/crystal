<p id="Par28">The geometry of this scanner is similar to the SAFIR prototype scanner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is composed of 2 (24) blocks of 8 × 8 detectors in axial (transaxial) direction. The blocks are arranged on a dodecagon prism, i.e., there are two blocks per module, each module on one side of the prism. The inner radius of the scanner is 67.75 mm. The crystal size is 2.1 × 2.1 × 12.0 mm
 <sup>3</sup>. Crystal gap and block gap are 0.1 mm and 0.6 mm, respectively, in both axial and transaxial directions.
