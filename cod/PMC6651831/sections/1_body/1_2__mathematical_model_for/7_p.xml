 <sub>c</sub> and the bottom surface serves as a heat sink with a temperature of T
 <sub>h</sub>. When the electrical current flows in the y-direction, the transverse Peltier effect will trigger heat flux along the z-direction. The maximum cooling capacity of the system is related to the Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T value, according to previous studies [
