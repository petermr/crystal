<p>Wiberg et al. reported the formation of Ti(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> (11.1 wt.% hydrogen content) in 1951 [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The synthetic route was the metathesis reaction between TiCl
 <sub>4</sub> and LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> in ether at −110 °C [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Later, in 1975, Kost et al. reported a similar synthesis while using LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and TiBr
 <sub>4</sub> or TiCl
 <sub>4</sub>. The product was separated from the solution in a filter cooled with dry ice [
 <xref rid="B241-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. The reported stoichiometries indicted that the metathesis reaction was not completed or that partial substitution of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> by [AlH
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> was achieved [
 <xref rid="B241-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. Wiberg reported that Ti(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> was decomposed at −85 °C [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; for its part, Kost reported the evolution of “two g-atom of H per g-atom of Ti” at −70 °C [
 <xref rid="B241-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. The decomposition of Ti(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> was proposed as [
 <xref rid="B241-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]: 
 <disp-formula>Ti(AlH
  <sub>4</sub>)
  <sub>4</sub> → TiH
  <sub>2</sub> + 4AlH
  <sub>3</sub> + H
  <sub>2.</sub>
