<p id="p0150">The FT-IR spectra of the samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. All of them contain a large band below 1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> due to the intrinsic adsorption of the material. It is asymmetric, with a maximum at 640 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and a shoulder at 790 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. This vibrational envelope is formed by stretching vibrations of Nb–O bonds in NbO
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedra and will not be discussed in detail here. Instead, with the scope of our study, we will focus on the adsorption bands in the 3000–3700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> interval and around 1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, where stretching and bending vibrations of adsorbed water molecules (and hydroxyl groups) are falling, respectively. These intervals are shown zoomed in the inset of 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. There are two bands centered at about 3440 and 3250 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> that can be distinguished in the higher-frequency interval by running a multiple peak fit with gaussians (shown by dashed curves in the inset of 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). The former band is larger and can be ascribed to weakly bonded water molecules adsorbed on the surface. The lower-frequency band is consistent with that immanent to confined water (i.e. in the structure of ice), and can be attributed to water molecules embedded into the crystal lattice of the material through the formation of the weak hydrogen, weak ionic or partially covalent bonds [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The profile of NCN0.25 notably contains an additional component, situated at the intermediate position of ca. 3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The attribution of this band is not straightforward; it might belong to intercalated water as well as to hydroxyl moieties from partially dissociated water molecules. In this regard, we recall that stretching vibrations of the O–H bonds in water molecules and those of the OH
 <sup>–</sup> groups are falling close (closely located), hence, the positions of the respective deformation vibrations are worth considering for their identification [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consequently, there are two components that can be individuated at 1635 and 1592 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the complex profile of the O–H bending band (inset in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) for all the samples; with the additional shoulder at higher wavenumbers for NCN0.25 (at 1685 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) as well as for NCN1.00 (at 1655 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The presence of three components in both vibrational intervals of NCN0.25 and NCN1.00 may be indicative for other types of water moieties being built differently into the structure of the compound.
