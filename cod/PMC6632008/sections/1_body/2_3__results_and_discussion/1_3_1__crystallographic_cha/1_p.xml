 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f001">Figure 1</xref>) collected with Cu Kα radiation evidenced the presence of the perovskite cubic phase. In a first approach, the crystal structure was refined on the basis of a simple cubic aristotype defined in the standard perovskite model at Pm-3m space group, with unit-cell parameter of
