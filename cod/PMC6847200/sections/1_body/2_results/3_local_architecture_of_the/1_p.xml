<p>Within the three-way junction of the 2′-dG-II aptamer domain is a set of nucleobase-mediated interactions that are universally conserved within the purine riboswitch family (grey box, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These interactions are primarily mediated by highly conserved nucleotides and/or nucleobase interactions in the joining strands (J1/2, J2/3 and J3/1) of the three-way junction along with the two junction-proximal base pairs of the P1 helix. Most distal to the P1 helix is a universally conserved base triple formed by a Watson–Crick pair between the first and last nucleotides of J2/3 (G46–C53) and a Watson–Crick/sugar edge interaction between A23 of J1/2 and G46. Adjacent to this triple is a Watson–Crick pair between A52 and U22. While in the guanine/adenine and 2′-dG-II classes this is a U–A pair, it is a C–G pair in 2′-dG-I (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); mutation of the U–A pair in the 
 <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch from to a C–G pair imparts only a modest loss in binding affinity (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) in support of the general requirement for a Y22–R52 base pair. The third layer in the junction is a base triple involving C51, C78 and 2′-dG. This triple is universal within the purine family, although the mode of base-base interactions differs amongst the classes (
 <italic>vide infra</italic>). C50 of J2/3 engages the junction-proximal Watson–Crick pair (G21–C79) of the P1 helix through a two hydrogen bonding interaction that is conserved throughout the purine family, despite the differing G–C nucleotide identity of the junction-proximal base pair of P1 in 2′-dG-II compared to the A–U pair found in the other classes. The one variable structural aspect of the core is how the second junction proximal base pair in P1 (U20–A80) interacts with J2/3. Disruption of this interaction in the 
 <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch has a very modest negative affect on ligand binding affinity (
