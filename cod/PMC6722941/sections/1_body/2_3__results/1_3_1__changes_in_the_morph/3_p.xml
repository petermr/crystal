As could be observed from the data represented in annealing, a decrease in the mass of nanoparticles is observed. That is caused by a change in the phase composition and burn up of amorphous inclusions containing oxygen. The results of the change in the atomic ratio of the components as a result of the annealing are presented in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The data were obtained using the method of energy dispersive analysis by taking spectra from different parts of nanoparticles and determining the average values of parameters. Also, studies of the uniformity of the distribution of elements were estimated by taking maps of the distribution of elements using the mapping method.
