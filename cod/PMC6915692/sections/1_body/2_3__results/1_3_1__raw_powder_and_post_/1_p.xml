<p>The comparison of three reference samples is first discussed: the raw powder directly issued from the polyol synthesis; “blue powder”, the sample obtained from a post-annealing treatment under air at 600 °C; “yellow powder”, of the as-prepared raw powder, and the sample resulting from a post-annealing treatment under argon (with pO
 <sub>2</sub> ≅ 10
 <sup>−5</sup> atm) at 600 °C; “black powder”.
