  <p>Ion-O RDFs. (a) Na
   <sup>+</sup>-O RDF in the first three layers and solution. (b) Same as (a) but for Cl
   <sup>–</sup>. (c) Na
   <sup>+</sup>-O RDF for two kinds of Na
   <sup>+</sup> in the first layer, namely, coordinating with (labeled as type I) and without (labeled as type II) counter ions. Here, “total” denotes the sum of type I and type II. (d) Same as (c) but for Cl
   <sup>–</sup> in the first layer. The insets show the focus view of the first peak of ion-O RDF.
