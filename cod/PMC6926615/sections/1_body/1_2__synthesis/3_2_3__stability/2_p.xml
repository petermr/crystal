<p>Lead-free perovskites already implemented as a photosensitive material for photodetectors [
 <xref rid="B64-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and solar cells [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, theoretical work [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] predicted that lead-free perovskites have even higher optical absorption compared to lead-based ones, which shows the advantages of their further implementation in all sorts of photovoltaic devices. In the following sections, we will focus on the light-emitting devices and lasers based on lead-free perovskites together with providing the background of the topic.
