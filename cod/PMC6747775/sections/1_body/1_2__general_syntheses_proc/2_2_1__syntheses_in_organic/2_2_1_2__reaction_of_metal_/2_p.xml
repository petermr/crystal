<p>This type of reaction is known as “the Schlesinger method”. Despite the simplicity of this reaction, it requires the use of milled LiH (finer than 100 mesh). Additionally, this reaction requires an excess of LiH. Substitution of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> by AlBr
 <sub>3</sub> can also be effective [

 <sub>3</sub>, to produce NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and KAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, these reactions need the use of Al(C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> as a catalyst for the reaction with NaH, and C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>-(C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O as the solvent; and Al(C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> or (i-C
 <sub>4</sub>H
 <sub>9</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>AlH as a catalyst for the reaction with KH [
