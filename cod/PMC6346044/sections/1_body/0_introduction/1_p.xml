 </sup>. For example, bulk amorphous alloys exhibit high strength, peculiar elastic properties, and other unusual engineering characteristics

In this article we demonstrate that a topological inspection of the structure of the eutectic sodium-potassium (NaK) alloy using machine learning analyses predicts excellently the solidification fate of the liquid eutectic alloy leading to crystalline and amorphous solids. Indeed, our findings are in full agreement with our Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) simulations using the second moment approximation (SMA) potential
