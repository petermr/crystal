<p id="p0100">At cooling 
 <italic>a</italic>(
 <italic>T</italic>) and 
 <italic>V</italic>(
 <italic>T</italic>) in 
 <italic>C</italic> and 
 <italic>Psc</italic> phases precisely repeat their course at heating; in the 400–450 K interval, all the dependences behave in the opposite way, and in the 320–360 K interval, there are no jumps in the parameters. It can be assumed that the jumps of 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>V</italic> NCN0.10 in the region 320K &lt; 
 <italic>T &lt;</italic> 360 K during heating is caused by changes in the relative content of 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>Q</italic> phases. The temperature ranges of the anomalous behavior of the dependences of the NCN0.10 structural parameters coincide with those in pure NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this paper the following behavioral abnormalities of NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> characteristics have been identified: 
 <italic>ε</italic> (
 <italic>T</italic>) (350 K, 420 K), a change in the slope of the temperature dependence of the relative elongation ΔL/L
 <sub>0</sub> (430 K), the appearance of the incommensurate phase (410–460 K), the coexistence of the 
 <italic>P</italic> (AFE) and 
 <italic>Q</italic> (FE) phases (410–490 K), wherein the amount of 
 <italic>Q</italic> phase increases with increasing 
 <italic>T</italic> and decreases with cooling. In large NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> single crystals [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>Q</italic> phases coexist from room temperature to 530 K. It is noted that the appearance of the 
 <italic>Q</italic> phase in crystals is not reproducible and the conditions for its formation are not known. The parameter 
 <italic>a</italic> of the 
 <italic>Q</italic> phase cell is larger than the parameter 
 <italic>a</italic> of the 
 <italic>P</italic> phase (in NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> by ≈ 0.006, 0.007 Å [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Thus, the anomalies of the temperature dependences of all the parameters of the NCN0.10 SS, established in this study, are completely determined by the features of the NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> structure. Another reason for the abnormal behavior of the structural characteristics of NCN0.10 may be the presence of oxyhydryl groups O
 <sub>m</sub>H
 <sub>n</sub> in the SS structure. Depending on the degree and nature of the bond of the O
 <sub>m</sub>H
 <sub>n</sub> groups with the crystal lattice, some leave the structure at 
 <italic>T</italic> &lt; 370 K, others – at 
 <italic>T</italic> &gt; 370 K [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The process of breaking the chemical bond and leaving the structure occurs in a certain temperature range and may be accompanied by the appearance of broad extremums on the temperature dependences of the structural characteristics.
