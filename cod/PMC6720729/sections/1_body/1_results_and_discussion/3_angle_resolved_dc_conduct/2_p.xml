<p>To perform the angle-resolved DC conductance measurements, a fixed electrode was chosen and defined as the reference electrode (RE), and a constant bias voltage (50 mV) was alternately applied between the other 11 test electrodes (TEs) and the reference electrode. In addition, each pair of diagonally positioned electrodes were separated by 10 μm at 180° apart and the transfer characteristic curves and the output characteristic curves were plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, respectively, consist with the variation of test angles from 0° to 180°. All the obvious angle-dependent linear curves demonstrate the semi-metal phase and anisotropic electrical property of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> shows the angle-resolved resistance in radar coordinates (where θ is the angle with respect to the 0° reference electrode), which was displayed to highlight the large resistance along one direction of the sample. From the fitted data, the ratio of the maximum and the minimum resistance is extracted to be around 10
 <sup>3</sup>, indicating a highly anisotropic DC conductance of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, which indicates its promising application for electronic-related sensors.
