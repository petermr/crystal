<p>It is known that the accuracies of the measured d-values and the angles between the reflections of SAED are inferior to the accuracy in X-ray diffraction (XRD) due to the presence of electromagnetic lenses in the TEM [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, crystal structure of the new phase of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn was further determined from XRD profiles of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn powder (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) using JADE and Jana software after Rietveld full-profile refinement. The refinement result of XRD profile of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn powder at 93 K was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f006">Figure 6</xref>, in which the hexagonal phase and the orthorhombic phase positions were indicated by green bars and red bars, respectively. Phase content could also be obtained, which turned out the existence of 17.34% parent phase (hexagonal phase) left without transformation at 93 K. XRD profile at 93 K was indexed to be base-centered orthorhombic structure with lattice parameters of a = 5.87 Å, b = 10.37 Å, c = 4.76 Å, and the space group was Cmcm, atomic Wyckoff positions were Ti (8g): (0.231, 0.904, 0.250), Ti (4c): (0, 0.636, 0.250), Sn (4c): (0, 0.163, 0.250), as listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02484-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Comparing the orthorhombic lattice parameters of a, b and c obtained from SAED and XRD, the differences were reasonable and within 5% measurement error of SAED.
