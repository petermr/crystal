<p>Thirteen landmarks and three semi-landmarks were defined, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Thirteen semi-landmarks were located on the femoral head (FH13), lateral condyle (LC13), and medial condyle (MC13) in order to describe the external curvature of each individual. Curves consisted of two landmark control points and eleven automatically generated semi-landmarks. Individual semi-landmarks were not determined by anatomical feature but by mathematical calculation so as to locate them at equal interval on the external curvature. The 3-D coordinates of each landmark and semi-landmark were obtained using Checkpoint (Stratovan Corporation, Davis, CA, USA) and were subjected to Procrustes analysis using MATLAB R2018b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Procrustes analysis was performed to ensure that landmark coordinates were translated, scaled, and rotated to the best superimposition. The resultant landmark coordinates were referred to as Procrustes shape coordinates, which were used for both the proximal and distal epiphyses. Changes in the position of the landmarks were observed with each Procrustes shape coordinate. The size of each specimen was represented as the centroid size, which was calculated as the square root of the sum of squared distances from the centroid to each landmark.
