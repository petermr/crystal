<p>The oversight of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> as product from binary reaction mixtures in earlier works is surprising since we could consistently obtain it irrespective of the choice of Si starting material (nano or micro) or Si/B ratio (1:3 or 1:4). Most likely, β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> escaped previous investigations because of the comparatively low temperatures and long reaction times needed. The evolution of products from nano-Si/B = 1:4 reaction mixtures at 1175 °C strongly suggests that β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> forms from conversion of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, which is greatly assisted by the presence of excess B. Accordingly, the reaction α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> + 
 <italic>x</italic>B = β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> is comparatively fast, whereas the direct conversion 3/(3 – 
 <italic>x</italic>)α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> = β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> + 
 <italic>x</italic>Si, which is assumed to occur in 1:3 reaction mixtures, is slow. Importantly, both conversions occur in a narrow temperature window, 1175–1200 °C. Nano-Si/B = 1:4 reactions afforded β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> as 5–10 μm sized crystallites, which could be easily noted by their characteristic orange-red color upon inspecting samples in an optical microscope.
