<p id="Par36">It is commonly assumed that particles are crushed during the pressing, and the influence of the grain size can be neglected already for an intermediate density. Our data shows that the information on the initial grain size of HE is preserved after the pressing up to the maximum achievable density. The influence of the grain size on the electrical conductivity at the detonation of RDX is revealed through the integral quantity Φ(

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The probability that the point for small grain size belong to the linear dependence Φ
