 </xref>a that the 5% decomposition temperature of the CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer hybrid film and the neat polymer film presented at 257.9 and 287.6 °C, respectively, indicative of the significant ligands of TOP/oleic acid-capped QDs. Our result is similar to the previous study of TGA followed by Fourier transform infrared analysis.

 </xref>b, the maximum decomposition temperature (446.5 °C) of the CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer hybrid film was slightly higher than that (431.6 °C) of the neat polymer, reflecting that the involvement of inorganic CdSe/ZnS QDs in the polymer matrix would increase the maximum decomposition temperature. Consequently, the thermal stability can be improved in CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer hybrid films.
