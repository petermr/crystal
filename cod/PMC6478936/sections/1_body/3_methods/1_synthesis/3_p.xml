<p id="Par25">The starting materials were mixed in an agate mortar and put into a tantalum ampule. The ampule was sealed utilizing tungsten inert gas welding. During the welding process, the ampule was water-cooled to avoid untimely decomposition of the lithium azide. The closed ampule was then placed in a silica tube, which was evacuated to prevent the oxidization of the tantalum ampule. This silica tube was placed into a tube furnace and heated to 800 °C. The sample was maintained at this temperature for 100 h and subsequently cooled down to 500 °C with 0.1 °C per minute. Upon reaching 500 °C, the furnace was turned off and the sample was left to cool down to room temperature.</p>
