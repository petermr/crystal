<p>Doping of traditional semiconductors is quintessential for their application in optoelectronics devices; therefore, it is tempting to dope Pb(II) perovskite thin films with various other ions. Monovalent cations Cu(I), Na(I), and Ag(I)

 </sup> It has been found that for these materials, small doping levels with respect to Pb give maximum enhancement of optoelectronic properties with minimal structural modification. Furthermore, the use of additives that influence film formation
