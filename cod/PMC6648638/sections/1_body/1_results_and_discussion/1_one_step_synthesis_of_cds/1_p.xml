 </xref>a,b present the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the synthesized red and green quantum dots, respectively. Although the chemical composition gradient of red and green quantum dots is different, both QDs had a spherical shape and a narrow size ranging from 7 to 9 nm. In our experimental conditions, the QDs exhibited a stable size distribution of 7–9 nm corresponding to a shell (ZnS) thickness of about 1.5 nm.

 </xref>, respectively. The indicated diffraction signals (2θ) of 26.3, 42.6, and 51.9° at the bottom represent the respective (111), (220), and (311) crystal planes (JCPDS 19-0191) of the zinc blende cubic crystal structure of CdSe. The indicated diffraction signals of 28.5, 47.515, and 56.28° at the top represent the respective (111), (220), and (311) crystal planes (JCPDS 05-0566) of the zinc blende cubic crystal structure of ZnS. Note that the diffraction signals of the quantum dots prepared in this work are present at 28.14, 47.13, and 55.78°, respectively. Compared with the standard diffraction signals of CdSe and ZnS, the CdSe/ZnS diffraction peaks slightly shifted from smaller angles (corresponding to the CdSe crystal) to larger angles (corresponding to the ZnS crystal). This implies that the synthesized quantum dots have a core–shell structure.
