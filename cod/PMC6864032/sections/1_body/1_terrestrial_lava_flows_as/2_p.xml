<p id="Par3">Theo’s Flow is a 120 m-thick magmatic pile located in the mafic and ultramafic region of the Archean Abitibi greenstone belt (Munro Township, Ontario)

 </sup> that was affected by metamorphic alteration under greenschist facies conditions (e.g. &lt;500 °C). However, the well-preserved textural relationships and absence of evidence of alteration of the augites within the flow suggest that they did not suffer either a resetting of their chemical signatures or metamorphic alteration

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. The entire magmatic pile contains the following lithologies (bottom to top): peridotite (~9 m), pyroxenite (~60 m), gabbro together with a pegmatitic pyroxenite (~40 m) and hyaloclastite (~10 m thick). The top quenched margin of the hyaloclastite is a breccia

 </sup> that together with pillow basalts and pyroclastites

 </sup> suggests that subaerial setting followed by a submarine environment characterized the origin and evolution of Theo’s Flow. In particular, based on detailed petrography and geochemistry, the pyroxenite layer has always been regarded as the best terrestrial analogue of nakhlites
