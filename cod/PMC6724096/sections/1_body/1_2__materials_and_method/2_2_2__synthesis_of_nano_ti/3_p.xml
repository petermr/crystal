Rotating packing is not only the source of a high-gravity field but also the most important and basic technical support of high-gravity technology. In this experiment, by changing the rotating speed of the packing to 400, 800 and 1200 rpm (according to the calculation formula of Fan et al. [

 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the corresponding high-gravity levels are 10.44, 41.78, 94.01), we investigated the effect of the rotating speed of packing in IS-RPB on the synthesis of nano-TiO
