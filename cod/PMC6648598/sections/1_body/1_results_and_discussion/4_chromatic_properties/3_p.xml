<p>The color of materials can be affected by a combination of factors, such as particle size, packing density, crystal structure, and chemical composition. As the particle size of the pigment decreases, the color tends to be brighter or lighter.

 </xref>, there was no difference in the particle size of monoclinic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and tetragonal (Bi
 <sub>1â€“
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>Ta
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3+
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.03 and 0.04). Therefore, the color of these pigments depends on the crystal system. In contrast, the particle size of (Bi
 <sub>0.80</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.20</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.40</sub> was smaller than those of other samples and the color of (Bi
 <sub>0.80</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.20</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.40</sub> was relatively light. The pale coloration can be attributed not only to the change of the crystal structure but also the reduction of the particle size.
