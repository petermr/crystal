<p>What makes it interesting is that the above result apparently goes against the intuitive judgment on (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub>, which seems easier to get compressed since the long-chain ligands leave sufficient space to reduce the volume. This stiff behavior of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> must be retraced to an unusual lattice change. XRD (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) and first-priciples calculation (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) identically show that evolution trends of lattice constants 
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic>, and 
 <italic>c</italic> of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> under pressure are distinctively divided into two. The deformation Δ
 <italic>c</italic> (~2 Å) is five times greater than Δ
 <italic>a</italic> (~0.39 Å) and Δ
 <italic>b</italic> (~0.47 Å). Even with the valuation of percentage, the deformation along 
 <italic>c</italic> axis (6.0%) is still noticeably greater than 
 <italic>a</italic> axis (4.4%) and 
 <italic>b</italic> axis (5.3%), showing an average of 24% greater of decreasing under hydrostatic pressure within 6 GPa and demonstrating clear anisotropic compression. During the compression, the crystal maintains triclinic structure without any phase transition, which can be proved by the unchanged lattice angles α, β, and γ (shown in fig. S9) as well as the absence of phase transition–induced bandgap “energy jump.” The 
 <italic>c</italic> axis represents the out-of-plane direction (perpendicular to the basal plane formed by consecutive [PbI
 <sub>6</sub>]
 <sup>4−</sup> octahedra), while 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> axes are in-plane directions. On the basis of the lattice constant, the length of Pb─I bond can be obtained, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. &lt;Pb─I&gt;
 <sub>equatorial</sub> and &lt;Pb─I&gt;
 <sub>axial</sub> are along in-plane and out-of-plane directions, which decrease equivalently (3.2 to 3.0 Å versus 3.25 to 3.05 Å). The bond length quadratic elongation and bond angle variance of Pb─I and Pb─I─Pb bond angle between adjacent octahedra are extracted from XRD data and first-principles calculation, which shows no pressure dependence (fig. S10). As a result, the compression of the unit cell is strongly anisotropic, despite the fact that hydrostatic pressure is applied from all directions. However, the compression of the [PbI
 <sub>6</sub>]
 <sup>4−</sup> octahedra is fully isotropic and free of distortion and rotation. The stiff character of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> can be attributed to its unique anisotropic deformation. Comparing to compression of 3D organolead halide perovskites in which 
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic>, and 
 <italic>c</italic> are almost equally squeezed (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>27</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>43</italic>
 </xref>), the parameter 
 <italic>c</italic> of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> dominates the compression. Therefore, the volume reduction (Δ
 <italic>a</italic> × Δ
 <italic>b</italic> × Δ
 <italic>c</italic>, Δ
 <italic>a</italic>, and Δ
 <italic>b</italic> are negligible) is slow, making the crystal present stiff character.
