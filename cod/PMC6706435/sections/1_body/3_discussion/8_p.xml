 </sup>, the analytical relation was obtained between the critical diameter and the grain size through the surface area in the whole density range. The necessity of an experimental verification is mentioned there, and the results our work can be considered as such verification. Since the kinetics of the reaction zone governs the condensation of carbon at the detonation
