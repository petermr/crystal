 </xref>a,b, the level ordering and the oscillator strengths of the various transitions, which depend on the elongated shape. A detailed related discussion is given in ref. [qv: 17b]. The spherical symmetry of the dot‐like core should lead to a band‐edge exciton structure with the same symmetry as for the spherical nanocrystals, which show a low degree of polarization (DOP) for the emission. This is in contrast with the observed strongly polarized emission, which indicates that the anisotropic shell around the core can modify the electronic structure, as was reported, for example, in ref. [qv: 17b] for CdSe/CdS dot‐in‐plate structures. In the excited state, the electron wavefunction from the CdSe core is able to extend into the conduction band of the CdS shell, and into the shell volume to create polarized emission.[qv: 10b]
