<p>By looking at the electron localization function of the single chain and bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>, we identified the bonding characters: the two Se–Se bondings in V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> octahedron and two Se–Se bondings in Se
 <sub>5</sub> are covalent, and the Se–V bondings are ionic. Accordingly, we expect that the charge valence of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> would be (V
 <sup>5+</sup>)
 <sub>2</sub>(Se
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup>)
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sup>2–</sup>. It implies that the system would be diamagnetic because there is no unpaired electron.
