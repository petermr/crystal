<p>Two separate calculations each using different basis sets were carried out. In the first one, we applied the following basis sets for the respective atomic centers: 3-1p1G for hydrogen, and 6-31d1G for carbon and nitrogen. Since Gatti et al. have jointly proposed these basis sets [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], for sake of clarity in the present work we will refer to them as “Gatti” basis sets. For the second calculation, we used triple-ζ valence basis set with polarization (TZVP), applied uniformly for all atomic centers (C, N, H). The employment of the TZVP basis set substantially increased the computational expense.
