This research was carried out at the light source PETRA III at DESY, a member of the Helmholtz Association (HGF). Theoretical calculations of structural properties were supported by the Ministry of Science and High Education of the Russian Federation in the framework of Increase Competitiveness Program of NUST “MISIS” (No. K2-2019-001) implemented by a governmental decree dated 16 March 2013, No. 211. Theoretical analysis of the electronic structure was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Grant 19-02-00871). Financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VR) through Grant no. 2015-04391 and the Swedish Government Strategic Research Areas in Materials Science on Functional Materials at Linköping University (Faculty Grant SFO-Mat-LiU No. 2009-00971) and SeRC are gratefully acknowledged.</p>
