<p>It has been recently shown that a single layer of hard spheres introduced into the f.c.c. crystal of Yukawa spheres (which in its pristine form exhibits weak auxetic properties [

In this work we consider only hard interactions to answer the more fundamental question: is there any, and if so, what is the influence of the inclusion particles’ size (in relation to the size of the remaining particles forming the matrix of the system) on Poisson’s ratio of the model system? The results of the study are compared with the results obtained for the f.c.c. crystal composed of identical hard spheres.
