<p>When designing Ð° complicated holographic device (for example AR display) based on anisotropic liquid crystal-photopolymer composite materials, containing slanted transparent, and/or reflection gratings, the developer must consider the contributions of all of the influencing recording nonlinear processes: Photopolymerization, diffusion, and polarization grating formation.</p>
