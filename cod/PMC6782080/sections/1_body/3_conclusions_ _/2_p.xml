<p>In this work, the cross-sectional investigation of twin defects in ZnO nanospikes complements previous plan-view studies and more generally opens up the fundamental characterization of complex and highly anisotropic nanostructures containing structural defects. The preparation of multiple cross-section specimens of nanospikes attached to a substrate particle to achieve electron transparency was established using the shadow-FIB geometry. Intrinsic and multiple twinning was observed to be a main structural feature and is assumed to reduce the surface energy during the growth process along an energetically more unfavourable

The phase-contrast simulations revealed the nature of the approximate twin boundary configurations and a direct link to plan-view investigations could be demonstrated.
