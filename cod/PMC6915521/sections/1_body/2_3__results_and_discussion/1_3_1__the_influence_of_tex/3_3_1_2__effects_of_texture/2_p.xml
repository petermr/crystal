 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the average friction forces of textured surfaces with different widths. With an increase in width, the average friction forces become higher, and the textured surface with the width 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.3615 nm has the lowest friction force in this work. In [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the textured surface with smaller spacing has higher friction forces, similar to the bigger texture width, and both the smaller spacing and bigger texture width induce a higher texture density. The increase in texture width leads to an increase in contact area, which increases the adhesion component. Besides, the sliding process causes the fracture of the bonds, the transfer of abrasive particles and the generation of dislocations, and all these cause atom accumulation. Taking the case of 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.723 nm as an example, the atomsâ€™ distribution during the sliding contact are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f006">Figure 6</xref>. At the initial stage, there are some atoms filled into the spacings of the textures due to the scratch of the tip, and a few atoms are piled up in front of the tip, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f006">Figure 6</xref>a. As the sliding occurs, many atoms accumulate in front of the tip at the intermediate stage in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. In the final stage, more atoms are piled up, and no textures are left in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f006">Figure 6</xref>c, as the spacings are filled by the accumulated atoms. As texture width increases, more abrasive particles are piled up in front of the tip, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f007">Figure 7</xref>, which induces a higher scratching depth and increases the ploughing component. The corresponding adhesion component and ploughing component are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The two components are increased with the increase in texture width. Compared with the smaller texture width, the ploughing component plays a more important role with a larger texture width. As a result, the increase of both adhesion and ploughing components results in a higher average friction force for a larger width.
