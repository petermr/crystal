<p>Traffic noise is considered as the major source of noise pollution in cities [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All these means of transportation such as airplanes, buses, trains, heavy trucks and motor-cycles increase the noise pollution [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Noise is a kind of energy but with sound pressure levels higher than the levels that are audible by human ear. According to the third law of thermodynamics, mechanical energy can be converted to electrical energy, thus sound as a form of mechanical energy can be converted to electric energy. There are three approached to convert sonic energy to electric energy; by heating, by using the diaphragm and through using piezoelectric materials. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This research will focus on utilizing noise through using piezoelectric materials as an approach of conversion to produce green sustainable electric energy that can be used to decrease the energy consumption produced from non-renewable sources.
