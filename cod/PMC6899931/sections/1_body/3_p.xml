<p>The determination of basic crystallographic information and chemical composition set the stage for optimizing the synthesis conditions. Powder diffraction patterns with LaB
 <sub>6</sub> as an internal standard resulted in lattice parameters of 
 <italic>a=</italic>4.4868(2) Å, 
 <italic>b=</italic>10.1066(5) Å, and 
 <italic>c=</italic>9.0753(4) Å. The optimized synthesis produced ingots containing specimen of sufficient size and quality for single crystal X‐ray diffraction. These were isolated from the crude product by leaching with 0.1 
 <sc>m</sc> NaOH.
