<p>Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> is chosen in this study because of the following reasons: (i) Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> is the first experimentally confirmed magnetic Weyl semimetal, with the existence of a Co atom–derived topologically protected surface states (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>18</italic>
 </xref>). (ii) Co atoms generally serve as active centers for the OER (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>). (iii) The observed high conductivity, robust surface states, and the magnetic Co ions in this compound indicate an intrinsic high OER activity (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>). The crystal structure of Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> is shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. It belongs to the Shandite family, exhibiting hexagonal Kagome lattices with the space group 166 (R-3
 <italic>m</italic>). Co atoms occupy Wyckoff position 3e, while S atoms are located in position 2c with 
 <italic>z</italic>(S) = 0.216. There are two types of Sn atoms, which occupy positions 1a and 1b (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>). This arrangement can be viewed as a quasi-2D structure stacked along the 
 <italic>z</italic> direction with the Sn-[S-(Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn)-S] layer group. The Co atoms form a Kagome lattice network with one Sn atom located at the center (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, top right). Thus, freshly cleaved surfaces of the measured single crystals for catalysis always expose the (001) facet, with three different terminations: (i) six Sn atoms, (ii) six S atoms, and (iii) the Kagome lattice with six Co atoms and one Sn atom. The 3D Brillouin zone (BZ) and the corresponding (001) surface BZ are shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. The calculation details can be seen in the Supplementary Materials.
