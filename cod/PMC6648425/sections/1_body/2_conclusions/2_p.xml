<p>We have carried out first-principle calculations to investigate the oxygen diffusion in double perovskite PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>. Ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and paramagnetic phases, which were experimentally reported, were found with one oxygen vacancy. All of the magnetic phases were electronically metallic, and the state of the Fermi level exhibits the mixed oxygen 2p and cobalt 3d characterization. Surprisingly, cobalt ions in both octahedral and pyramidal sites possess an intermediate spin state in the paramagnetic phase, differing from the typical interpretation of the metal–insulator transition in PrBaCo

 </sub>. Oxygen diffusion path was examined on the basis of the obtained magnetic and vacant structures. The paramagnetic orthorhombic phase was taken into account for the diffusion calculations, since it is responsible for the situation in the temperature range of interest for intermediate temperature solid-oxide fuel cell applications. We conclude that the main contribution of oxygen diffusivity is attributed to the migration from the Pr–O layer to the Co–O layer or vice versa along the direction perpendicular to the one-dimensional oxygen-vacancy channel.
