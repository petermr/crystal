<p>Further structural deliberation of the Sn oxide SNCs required ab initio theoretical calculations that simulated the vibrational features in Raman spectra based on the atomic configurations of model clusters. For this purpose, density functional theory (DFT) calculations (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>34</italic>
 </xref>) were performed, using model Sn oxide SNCs with stoichiometric compositions estimated from XPS data (fig. S5D). These models were constructed starting from a rutile-type crystal structure, which was subsequently geometrically optimized to obtain a minimum energy configuration. Vibrational spectra were then simulated based on the structures obtained for each model SNCs and compared to the experimental SHINER spectra (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The simulated Raman spectrum for Sn
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>17</sub> contained multiple signals over a wide range of wavelengths, including a broad peak in the range of 500 to 800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, dashed line), which is 100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> higher than that observed in the actual SHINER spectra (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, solid line). This clear discrepancy between experimental and theoretical spectra required a reconsideration of the model structure for the vibrational simulations. A survey scan over wide energy range during XPS analyses of each Sn oxide SNC identified the presence of Ag, Au, Sn, O, and Si from either the Au@Ag SHINs or Sn oxide SNCs, while no other elements were detected. Therefore, the reconsideration of the model did not involve other elements, unless those were undetectable by XPS, such as H and He. As Ristić 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>33</italic>
 </xref>) indicated that the broad Raman band can be ascribed to amorphous Sn hydrous oxide, it is reasonable to include hydroxyl groups in the model, originated from the NaBH
 <sub>4</sub> methanol solution, atmospheric water vapor, or the silica shells of the Au@Ag SHINs adjacent to the Sn oxide SNCs.
