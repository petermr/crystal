 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> which appeared to be limited by the fact that the connection between the cavities involves two 8‐rings (i.e. forms a short channel) and is relatively rigid. In contrast, the micropore volume of 0.14 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup> found for SSZ‐27 is much more in line with what is expected for a zeolite (Supporting Information Figure S1). We suspect that the pore configuration consisting of only a single 8‐ring window connecting the large cavities allows for much more efficient diffusion.
