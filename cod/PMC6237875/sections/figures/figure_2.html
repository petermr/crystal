 <caption> Crystal structures of coesite-IV and coesite-V. Polyhedral models of the structures of coesite-IV ( a) and coesite-V ( b) (SiO 6 octahedra are brown; SiO 5 polyhedra are green; SiO 4 tetrahedra are blue); a fragment of the structures, similar for both coesite-IV and coesite-V, showing a three-dimensional framework of SiO 6 octahedra ( c) </caption>
