<p>The lowest-energy structures can be grouped according to hydrogen bonding motifs and packing modes. Five one-dimensional (1D: ribbon chains 1 and 2, ladder, tape, and chain), two 2D (motif 1 and 2), and three 0D (dimers) motifs were identified as recurring (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>c). The tape 
 <bold>form I</bold> motif was found 10 times among the lowest energy structures, albeit the specific packing was not found in the global minimum structure of either the PBE-TS (

 </xref>a) or PBE-D2 (

 </xref>b) lattice energy landscape. The lattice energy difference of the 
 <bold>form I</bold> (structure 780) with respect to the global minimum PBE-TS ribbon chain 1 motif was calculated to be 10.2 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup> and with respect to the PBE-D2 ribbon chain 2 motif 5.7 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup>. Such energy differences may be overestimated due to the lack of entropic contributions (disorder) in the lattice energy calculations, but present in the finite temperature 
 <bold>form I</bold> structure. The close proximity of the tape structures of

 </xref> (similar lattice energies and similar packing indices), all differing only in the packing of the common and strongly H-bonded ladder motif, may be indicative of directional disorder. The combination of structures 780 (ordered
