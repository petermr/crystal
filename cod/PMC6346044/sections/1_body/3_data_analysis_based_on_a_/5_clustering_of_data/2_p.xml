<p id="Par24">For visualizing the clustered data we recurred to identify the temperature at which each of the 18672 configurations was produced and its corresponding enthalpy and system density. Each configuration was given a color depending upon which of the three EM clusters it belonged to, blue for cluster-blue, red for cluster-red and black for cluster-black. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows how the data clustered. We remark that none of these thermodynamic values (temperature, enthalpy, density, volume) entered as attributes in the EM clustering or the PCA. Clearly, we see that cluster-blue corresponds to crystalline structures from our MMC simulations, cluster-black corresponds to amorphous solid structures, and cluster-red contains the liquid and supercooled liquid. Cluster-blue data are sharply separated from the rest, while there is a small region of temperature overlap between cluster-red and cluster-black in the 170–240 K temperature range. Indeed, cluster-red (liquid) has no configurations below 160 K. Likewise cluster-black (amorphous solid) has no configurations above 240 K.
