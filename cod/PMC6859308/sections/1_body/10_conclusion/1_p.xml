<p content-type="flushleft">Using a correlative X-ray microscopy approach, we have identified that in vivo BrQ—the bromo analog of chloroquine—covers a substantial part of available docking sites at the surface of hemozoin crystals formed in the digestive vacuole of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. Quantification of quinoline-type molecule in vivo coverage of hemozoin crystals in fully hydrated cells was achieved. This coverage was as high as 10 ± 4%, enough to prevent oncoming heme docking onto the crystals. The drug was found in abundance in the digestive vacuole. We have provided evidence, albeit indirect, that the drug complexes with free heme, given that the drug binds to the hemozoin surface. This complex accumulates at the membrane of the digestive vacuole, as observed by bromine X-ray fluorescence signal, and possibly spreads to other membranes. In other words, both hypotheses mentioned in the Introduction take place in vivo. This model can be generalized to quinoline drugs, such as quinine, which can stereospecifically bind to the {100}, {011}, and {001} faces of hemozoin.
