<p>Another important factor of image formation in transmission microscopes is the thickness of the specimens. Absorption of electrons in the crystal limits thickness of observed crystal specimens [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Electrons absorption is a function of the applied voltages and results in allowable thicknesses on the order of nanometers. In the images analyzed in this paper, the thickness of the specimen was on the order of 10 nm and the number of atomic planes in the specimen was approximately 30. The depth of focus of the electron microscope was large enough that some 3D features at different depths may appear in the 2D image [
