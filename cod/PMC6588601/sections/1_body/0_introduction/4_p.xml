<p id="Par6">Here, we use PMN to demonstrate an approach for obtaining fully atomistic nanoscale structural models directly from the experimental data. We employ large atomic ensembles and a Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm to simultaneously fit multiple types of diffraction and spectroscopic data, which notably include three-dimensional (3D) X-ray diffuse-scattering intensity distributions. Our results confirmed the rocksalt-type random-site chemical ordering of Mg and Nb and revealed a continuous distribution of the order parameter, with its nanoscale spatial fluctuations yielding regions of stronger order. The displacements of both Pb and Nb are aligned preferentially with the 〈111〉 directions and occur cooperatively over the nanoscale, forming polar 3D clusters. The arrangement of these clusters is nonrandom, resulting in aggregate PNRs that incorporate several inequivalent 〈111〉 clusters. The local alignment of displacements in such PNRs is maintained over an extended range, but the preferred alignment direction varies within a given region. The displacement magnitudes are largest near the PNR centers and decrease monotonically toward their boundaries, with a smooth transition from one PNR to another. No disordered non-polar matrix could be identified. The magnitudes of the Pb displacements are enhanced as the local Mg/Nb ratio increases; however, no spatial correlations between the PNRs and the much smaller CORs could be observed.</p>
