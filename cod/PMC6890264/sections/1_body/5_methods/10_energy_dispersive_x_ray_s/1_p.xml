<p>EDS measurements were performed on Thermo Fisher Scientific Tecnai 20F and Talos F200X electron microscopes using Tecnai Imaging and Analysis software. Sample preparation was similar to the preparation of TEM samples. In all cases, aluminum TEM grids were used. A low-background sample holder was used. Measurements were performed on areas with &gt;500 nanoparticles. Discussed elemental compositions are normalized to the stoichiometric sulfur contents.</p>
