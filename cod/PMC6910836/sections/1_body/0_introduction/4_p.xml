<p>Here, we report a highly sensitive analytical technique based on the principles of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) aiming for the analysis of subnanoscale particles (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In this work, the spectral analyses of the unique Raman signals of Sn oxide SNCs are complemented by theoretical structural and vibrational analyses to clarify the origin of the Raman characteristics of SNCs. The resulting structural and chemical information further explain the specific size-dependent catalytic activity of Sn oxide SNCs during the CO oxidation reaction. This study demonstrates comprehensive understanding of the chemical and structural natures of subnanomaterials, which will facilitate the rational design of subnanomaterials such as catalysts.
