<p>To answer this question, we followed up with a closer examination of the −IpCOHP values for the sulfides. A direct comparison between the −IpCOHP values of compounds with dissimilar compositions cannot be made because the average electrostatic potential in each density functional theory-based computation is set to an arbitrary “zero” energy, whose relative position may vary from system to system.

 </sup> In the lack of a true reference energy, the cumulative −IpCOHP/cell values, i.e., the sums of all negative IpCOHP/bond values for one particular type of nearest neighbor, interatomic interaction within one unit cell, were projected as percentages of the respective net bonding capabilities, a procedure that has been largely described elsewhere.
