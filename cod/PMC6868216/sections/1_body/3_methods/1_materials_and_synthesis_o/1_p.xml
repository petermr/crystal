 <sup>2+</sup> phosphors with different Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> content (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0–0.05) were prepared by employing solid-state reactions. The stoichiometric mixtures of K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (A.R.), Lu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.99%), SiO
 <sub>2</sub> (A.R.), and Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.99%) were thoroughly grounded and transferred into an alumina crucible. After that, the mixed starting materials were sintered at 1350 °C for 6 h in a forming gas atmosphere (N
 <sub>2</sub>:H
 <sub>2</sub> = 80:20), and finally quenched to room temperature. As a typical synthesis, 3.8 g raw materials (K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, Lu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) in the given stoichiometric ratio can produce ~2.3 g products.
