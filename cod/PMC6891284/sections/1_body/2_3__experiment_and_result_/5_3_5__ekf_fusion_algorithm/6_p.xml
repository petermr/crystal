<p>This experiment verified the effect of the EKF fusion algorithm on the positioning results. However, considering the poor positioning stability of the UWB positioning system and the accumulated error of the improved odometer positioning method, the final error of the fused positioning coordinates is still high. Therefore, although the fused positioning results have been improved compared to the use of a single positioning method, there is scope for further optimization.</p>
