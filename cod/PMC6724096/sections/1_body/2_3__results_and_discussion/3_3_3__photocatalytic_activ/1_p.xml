<p>A control experiment was carried out to explore the adsorption of toluene by the catalyst and the direct decomposition of toluene by high-energy UV light; i.e., toluene was degraded by only the catalyst, only light, and both the catalyst and light (1.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was used as the catalyst). The result is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f010">Figure 10</xref>a. Using only the catalyst, there is a slight decrease of the toluene concentration at the initial time, which was caused by the adsorption of the catalyst on toluene, and the concentration no longer decreases when the adsorption reaches equilibrium. Using only light, the toluene concentration remained weakly decreasing as the degradation progressed, because the photon energy at 254 nm was larger and a little toluene was decomposed. Using both the catalyst and light, toluene was greatly degraded. This is because TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is excited by UV light, forming electrons and holes, and a series of reactions produce oxidative species such as Â·OH, which can effectively decompose toluene.
