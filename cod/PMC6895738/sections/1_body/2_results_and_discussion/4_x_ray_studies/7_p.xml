<p id="p0120">The study has shown that NCN0.25 (at room temperature, its condition was designated as the phase R1) above 373 K, through the intermediate phase (R2) returns to the state that corresponds to original NCN0.25 (phase R3). The symmetry of the intermediate phase R2 is also orthorhombic, and the cell parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> has an average value between the parameters 
 <italic>b</italic> of the phases R1 and R3, with almost the same parameters 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 5</xref>a shows the XRD patterns of NCN0.25 in different phase states: at 293 K before heating (phase R1), 363 K (phases R1 + R2), 413 K (phases R2 + R3), 523 K (phase R3) and 293 K after heating (phases R3 and R1).
