<p id="Par15">The 3D electron diffraction data were collected on a 200 kV JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope, which was equipped with a quad hybrid pixel detector (Timepix). For data collection, a micro single crystal was selected and placed in the electron beam, and then the Z height was adjusted to the mechanical eucentric height. The selected-area ED patterns were captured from the crystal continuously when the goniometer was rotated. Finally, 374 ED patterns were recorded and the tilt rang was from −52.29° to 34.3° with the tilt step of 0.23°. The total time for data collection was 191 s. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a HITACHI F-4600 spectrofluorometer. Absolute quantum yields were obtained using a Quantaurus-QY measurement system (C9920–02, Hamamatsu Photonics) and all the samples were excited at 450 nm. A PR735 SpectraScan Spectroradiometer (Photo Research) was used to simultaneously record the electroluminescent spectra and CIE coordinates. The intensity
