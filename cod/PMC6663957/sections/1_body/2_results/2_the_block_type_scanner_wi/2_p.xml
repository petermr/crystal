<p id="Par49">The reconstruction was performed using both scanner models. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the reconstructed images of the uniform cylinder phantom. The cylindrical model creates significant artifacts prior to normalization correction while the block model yields a smooth cylinder. The COV ratio for the block model is much smaller than the one for the cylindrical model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). After correcting for normalization, the block and cylindrical models show similar results. The COV ratio for the block model increases from 18.4% to 20.9%. Although, the block model is visibly more uniform than the cylindrical one after normalization. This can be inferred from the COV ratios in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> which shows the COV ratio for the block model is 19% better comparing to the cylindrical one, after normalization.
