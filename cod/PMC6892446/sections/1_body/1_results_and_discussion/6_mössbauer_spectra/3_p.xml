 <italic>

 <italic>oP</italic>88) structure contains two crystallographically independent iron sites, these could not be resolved. We just observe the envelope of both sub‐signals with very close line width, quadrupole shift and isomer shift. In comparison with Mössbauer spectroscopic data of other iron oxides and hydroxides, the isomer shift is in good agreement with iron(III) in tetrahedral coordination.

Since the hyperfine field at room temperature is still high, the transition to the paramagnetic state is at much higher temperature. The magnetic moment per iron atom at 6 K was derived from the magnetic hyperfine field by using the conversion factor of 12.5 T corresponding to 1 μ
