 </sup> The dihedral angle of C1–C2–N6–O8 varied from 0.00° in gaseous to 18.82° in crystal phase, and the FF gave an accurate prediction about the dihedral angle with 18.82° in the crystal. The other dihedral angle (D(N3–C4–N9–O11)) about C–NO
 <sub>2</sub> is estimated to be −3.48° by the FF and in good agreement with the experimental value.

 </sup> After the crystal packing, all N–H bonds are shortened to 0.860 Å from 1.010 Å, and the angles of nitrogen atoms in amino groups increase to about 120°. Also the bond N12–O13 with the last hydrogen bond O13 bond is lengthened from 1.275 to 1.321 Å. The experimental values
