<p>To illustrate the general applicability of the findings presented above, we used GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP to convert luminescent CuInS
 <sub>2</sub> (CIS) NCs into (Cu,In,Ga)S
 <sub>2</sub> (CIGS) NCs with much brighter photoluminescence (see 
 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">Methods</xref> for details). The parent CIS NCs have an indium-rich composition with a Cu/In ratio of 0.68 ± 0.008:1. EDS analysis of the product NCs gives a Cu/Ga/In ratio of 0.20 ± 0.001:0.16 ± 0.001:1, indicating that Cu
 <sup>+</sup> ions are exchanged for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>. These cation ratios imply that the charge balance is preserved through the CE reaction, as the relative concentration of Ga ions multiplied by their charge of +3 exactly corresponds to the decrease in Cu concentration (with charge +1; 0.16 × 3 = 0.48; 0.68–0.20 = 0.48). Interestingly, the size (∼5.5 nm) and pyramidal shape of the CIS NCs are preserved in the product CIGS NCs (see

 </xref>a,d), despite the removal of a significant amount of cations from the NC. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the high-resolution TEM images allows determination of the lattice spacings, being 0.18, 0.21, and 0.34 nm before and after the reaction (

 <italic>q</italic> values (

 </xref>e), indicating a small contraction of the unit cell. This contraction is consistent with the exchange of the relatively large Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for the relatively small Ga
