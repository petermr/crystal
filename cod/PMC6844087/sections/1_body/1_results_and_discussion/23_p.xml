<p>The Rietveld refinement confirms what was suggested before: the purity is excellent in all of the samples and all of the values are extremely similar. The small diversity is not significant and is influenced by the small differences in the profile fitting quality. The mean purity value is 95.8 Â± 0.2%. This similarity in the results suggests that in these conditions a maximum purity is reached.</p>
