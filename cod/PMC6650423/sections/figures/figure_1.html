 <caption> Temperature-doping phase diagram of Hg1201. Orange filled circles represent T c (see the Methods section). Blue and green filled circles represent the pseudogap onset temperature T * determined by neutron scattering 17, 18 and resistivity measurements 24 , respectively. Purple filled circles show the CDW onset temperature T CDW determined by resonant X-ray diffraction 6, 7 . Red filled circles represent the onset temperature of diagonal nematicity determined by in-plane torque magnetometry, which lies on the pseudogap line (blue dashed line). Red open circles represent the temperature at which a suppression of the nematicity occurs, which is close to T CDW. The inset shows the crystal structure of Hg1201 </caption>
