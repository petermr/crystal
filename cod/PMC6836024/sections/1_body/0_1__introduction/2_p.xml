<p>Therefore, in this work, we present for the first time a strategy that enables the improvement of temperature-sensing properties of V-based luminescent nanothermometers via modification of the host material composition. This approach bases on the gradual substitution of Al
 <sup>3+</sup> ions by Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions into YAG nanocrystals. The introduction of gallium ions, which possess larger ionic radii in respect to Al
 <sup>3+</sup> ones leads to the lowering of crystal field (CF) strength. This arises from the elongation of the metal-oxygen (M-O) distance along with the enhancement of the contribution of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. The modification of the crystal field strength should strongly influence the temperature-dependent luminescent properties of V ions of different oxidation state (V
 <sup>5+</sup>, V
 <sup>4+</sup>, V
 <sup>3+</sup>). Moreover, the introduction of the gallium ions facilitates the stabilization of V
 <sup>4+</sup> oxidation state that possesses favorable performance for luminescent thermometry. However, these expectations have not yet been experimentally verified. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the influence of the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions concentration of the temperature dependent luminescent properties of vanadium ions in Y
