<p>The Au core nanoparticles (45 nm diameter) were prepared by the citrate reduction process, following Frens method (

 </xref>). Briefly, 100 ml of 0.01 wt % HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub> aqueous solution in a 300-ml round-bottom flask was first heated to boiling, and then, 0.7 ml of 1 wt % Na
 <sub>3</sub> citrate aqueous solution was quickly added. The boiling solution turned its color from pale yellow to faintly blue within 30 s and then suddenly changes into burgundy after approximately 2 min of vigorous stirring. Boiling was continued for 40 min to complete reaction and then allowed to cool down to room temperature.
