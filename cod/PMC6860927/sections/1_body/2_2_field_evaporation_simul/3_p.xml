<p>The virtual specimen was synthesized as a 15 nm high conical frustum with 23.6 nm base radius and 4.5° shank angle onto which a 15 nm sized hemisphere was placed. Atomic positions therein were defined by inscribing two rotated aggregates of aluminum (face-centered cubic, 0.404 nm) crystal unit cell lattices. Their orientation was assigned based on the values measured on the bi-crystal by TKD performed directly on the APT specimen (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In Bunge-Euler notation their orientation are

 <sub>2</sub> = 6.7° for grain 2. The virtual bi-crystal synthesis was completed by cutting the two crystals along a 0.2 nm-thick plane with a unit normal [−0.87, 0.44, −0.12] corresponding to the experimentally measured value. Given that the purpose of this setup was to test the application of the boundary tracking algorithm, rather than infer the detailed atomic structure of the grain boundary, the structure generated here was not atomically relaxed. The resulting mesh contained a total of 2.9 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Al atoms. These were encapsulated in a support mesh comprising 3.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> integration points. Field evaporation was simulated assuming (+1) as the evaporation charge state and 19 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> V m
 <sup>−1</sup> field strength, based on image hump model considerations [
