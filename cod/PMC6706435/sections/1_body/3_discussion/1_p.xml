<p id="Par35">Photographs of the RDX grains of different size used in the experiments are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Particles with the average size 〈

 <italic>μ</italic>m mostly have a rounded shape, and the grains have close sizes. This provides a high degree of homogeneity of a charge. The common powder also contains small particles, but the main part of HE is concentrated in large ones, which determine the duration of the chemical reaction zone.
