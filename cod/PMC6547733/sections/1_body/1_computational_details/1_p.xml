<p id="Par7">In order to investigate the effect of structure and composition on electronic excitation induced amorphization, several compounds with variable 
 <italic>B</italic>-site cation composition have been created by using the special quasirandom structure (SQS)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> generation code available in the ATAT toolkit
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. Two series of SQS intermediate structures were created. One series uses the monoclinic layered perovskite La
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> (LTO) crystal as its starting point and substitutes Zr for Ti, giving rise to La
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>2−x</sub>Zr
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> compounds (labeled Z-LTO) with a 
 <italic>monoclinic</italic> lattice. The other series uses the cubic pyrochlore La
 <sub>2</sub>Zr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> (LZO) crystal as its starting point and substitutes Ti for Zr, leading to La
 <sub>2</sub>Zr
 <sub>2−x</sub>Ti
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> compounds (labeled T-LZO) with a 
 <italic>cubic</italic> lattice. For consistency with the end-member LTO and LZO crystals, only SQS structures containing a total of 88 atoms were generated, such that all of the structures possess 16 La sites, 16 
 <italic>B</italic>-sites occupied by either pure Ti, pure Zr, or a mix of both species, and 56 O atoms.
