<p>To examine the potential of the as-synthesized phosphors for near-UV LED application, phosphor-converted LEDs were made using a phosphor powder and a InGaN LED with 365 nm emission.

 </xref> clearly shows that the 365 nm UV light emitted from the InGaN chip is absorbed by the phosphors and simultaneously downconverted into intensive, wide-band-emitting light. Upon increasing the forward-bias current from 10 to 50 mA, the emission intensities of the phosphors progressively increase. At the same time, the luminous output increases and the shape and position of the LED emission bands exhibit similarity, thus confirming that the phosphors show a stable emission property. As presented in

 </xref>, the maximum LED emission intensity for Ca and Sr increases after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, which is consistent with the PL spectra (see
