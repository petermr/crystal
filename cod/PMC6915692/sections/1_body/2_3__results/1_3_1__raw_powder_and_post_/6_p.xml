 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f003">Figure 3</xref>c) are very small with a size around 5 nm. The particle size distribution width is quite narrow (between 4 and 7 nm), but the agglomeration of the particles and their superimposition tend to limit the accuracy of the particle size distribution calculation. This very small size is in good agreement with the previous discussion extracted from the X-ray diffraction patterns. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows that for the black samples, two morphologies can be well distinguished: isotropic nanoparticles with a diameter in the range 5â€“10 nm and anisotropic particles (rod-like particles) with a diameter about 10 nm and a length that can reach about 100 nm. Finally, the air-annealed powder (yellow sample) shows significantly larger isotropic particles of about 50 nm average diameter.
