Transport measurements confirm purely insulating behavior of the samples. However with Ca doping, the structure undergoes into larger monoclinic distortion, which results in a larger deviation of the Ni-O-Re (∠NOR) bond angles from 180°. This deviation enables substantial superexchange interaction between the Ni
