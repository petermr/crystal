<p>Perovskite materials in common can be characterized by ABX
 <sub>3</sub> chemical formula where A is a large monovalent organic or inorganic cation, B is a divalent metal cation, X is a halide anion, or their mixture. Although this formula is relatively simple, it allows one to form materials with different composition and, hence, to achieve a wide variety of physical and chemical properties. Other modifications of the perovskite crystal structure include:
