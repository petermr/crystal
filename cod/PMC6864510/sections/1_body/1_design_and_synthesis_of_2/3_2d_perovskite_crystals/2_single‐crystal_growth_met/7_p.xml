<p>Kamminga et al. used four phenyl alkylammonium cations with different alkyl chains of one to four carbons to prepare single‐crystal perovskites at room temperature by a layered solution technique.[qv: 27a,43] The obtained products have good stability and can be stored in low humidity for several months without damage. It is interesting that two compounds with PMA (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>CH
 <sub>2</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) and PEA cations have 2D perovskite structure where inorganic layers are linked by corner‐sharing PbI
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra isolated by bilayers of organic cations.[qv: 42c,44] However, with longer carbon chains, the 1D perovskites with inorganic layers consisting of corner‐sharing and face‐sharing PbI
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra are obtained. Subsequently, Ye's group synthesized (PMA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI

 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub>, and (PBA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> (PBA = C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>(CH
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>NH

 <sup>+</sup>) perovskites by the same method. The source of fluorescence and the behavior of excitons were confirmed by experiments, and the quantum confinement effect caused by the structural reorganization was demonstrated by calculation.[qv: 27b] A series of phenyl‐ and naphthyl‐containing amine 2D perovskites with non‐centrosymmetric structures were achieved through a simple and high‐yielding liquid‐phase crystallization.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> These 2D perovskites possess broad white fluorescence emission in the long‐wavelength region resulting from the inorganic layer distortion induced by the introduction of large organic cations.
