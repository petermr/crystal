 </inline-formula> allows to describe the Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition within the XY universality class [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is characterized by a second-order phase transition in 3D (see the phase diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The transition of Sm-A into the hexagonal crystal phase Cr-B is always first-order in 3D due to the long-range positional order and the presence of a cubic term in the free-energy expansion in powers of the Fourier coefficients of the density [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The same cubic term is present for a Hex-B–Cr-B transition in 3D and gives rise to the first-order transition. The two lines of the first-order transitions intersect on the phase diagram at slightly different slopes, which also shifts the Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition to the first order [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This leads to the appearance of a tricritical point on the Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition line in the vicinity of the Sm-A–Hex-B–Cr-B triple point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At the tricritical point the Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition changes its order from first to second in the vicinity of the Sm-A–Hex-B–Cr-B triple point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f006">Figure 6</xref>). As a result, in many LC compounds the Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition occurs in the vicinity of the tricritical point.
