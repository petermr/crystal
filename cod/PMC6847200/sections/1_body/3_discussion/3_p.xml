<p>Another distinctive feature of the 2′-dG-II class of riboswitches is a broad range of selectivites for 2′-dG over the chemically related compound riboguanosine. While the 
 <italic>env1</italic> variant binds 2′-dG with high affinity as compared to other members of the 2′-dG-I and -II classes, it has very low ability to discriminate between these two compounds. Since the concentrations of these two compounds are similar in rapidly dividing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, this raises the distinct possibility that a subset of members of the 2′-dG-II class of riboswitches are responsive to either compound to regulate gene expression. This property was also observed in the 2′-dG-I riboswitches, which was divided into two ‘types’ based upon experimental analysis of ligand selectivity (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The first, exemplified by the 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA riboswitch, selectively binds 2′-dG over 3′-dG and guanosine, but the type II sequences bind these compounds with similar affinities. Thus, the ability to respond to a larger pool of guanosine metabolites is found within both classes of 2′-dG riboswitches and likely reflects a regulatory need by a subset of genes whose expression is controlled by these riboswitches.
