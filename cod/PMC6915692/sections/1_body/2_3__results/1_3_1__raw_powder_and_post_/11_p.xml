<p>The polyol synthesis, being carried out in a reducing medium in the presence of W
 <sup>5+</sup> ion in the raw powder can be easily explained, as the germination–growth steps in diethylene glycol in reducing alcohol resulted from the oxy-condensation of both W
 <sup>6+</sup> ions (mainly) and W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions (in a minor way). The particles obtained are therefore not stoichiometric WO
 <sub>3.0</sub>, but clearly exhibit an oxygen sub-stoichiometry with a chemical formulae WO
 <sub>3-δ</sub>. Interestingly, the EPR signal does not show the occurrence of free electrons; it can be considered that all the oxygen vacancies are associated with local O
 <sup>2−</sup> anions, which are associated to each other with two local W
 <sup>5+</sup> cations, to form a “triple defect” forming two W
 <sup>5+</sup> consecutive ions linked by an oxygen vacancy bridge. On the contrary, the post-annealing treatment under argon (about 10
 <sup>−5</sup> oxygen partial pressure) can produce (i) an oxygen exfoliation at the surface of the NPs, leading to an additional reduction associated to a segregation of tungsten W
 <sup>5+</sup> at the surface of the material, or (ii) the migration of the oxygen deficiencies from the bulk to the surface of the materials. In the black sample, the oxygen surface exfoliation leads to supernumerary electrons in regard to the oxygen vacancies in the crystallite core, hence allowing the occurrence of free electrons (oxygen vacancies being known to act as electron traps). A schematic representation of the blue and the black samples, with simplified crystallographic representation and associated energy band diagrams is proposed (
