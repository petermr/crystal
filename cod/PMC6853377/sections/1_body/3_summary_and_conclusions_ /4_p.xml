 <italic>k</italic>-field-of-view allows recording valence-band 
 <italic>k</italic>-maps that comprise many BZs (19 BZs in the case of Re). Thanks to the high brilliance (10

 <italic>h</italic>ν s
 <sup>−1</sup> in a spot of ∼20 µm), valence-band signals reached up to several million counts per second in the 
 <italic>d</italic>-band complex of transition metals (Re, Mo). Under such conditions, 3D bulk BZs can be mapped in a tomography-like manner in a few hours by varying the photon energy and exploiting direct transitions into free-electron-like final states. Recording multiple BZs can be utilized for a multiplexing of the intensity. Adding equivalent repeated patterns (exploiting the 
 <italic>k</italic>-space periodicity) is an effective way of intensity enhancement. Moreover, this procedure largely eliminates the matrix-element effect and partly also photoelectron diffraction contributions. Such an enhancement of intensity via ‘large-area recording’ and adding up equivalent band features of several BZs is not only interesting for momentum-microscopy but also for experiments using hemispherical analyzers.
