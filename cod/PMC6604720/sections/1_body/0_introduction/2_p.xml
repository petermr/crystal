<p>WLED systems composed of a blue LED and YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> is a facile and inexpensive way of obtaining white light. However, the white light by this system displays some inadequate optical properties, such as high correlated color temperature (CCT) and low color rendering index (CRI) due to a deficiency in red light [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To overcome this problem, one can integrate additional phosphors, such as red or red and green phosphors over the blue LED or one can employ the primary RGB colors over a UV or near-UV LED chip or one can use alternative luminescent materials, such as quantum dots [

 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], organic dyes [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], etc. In the case of phosphors, combining a red phosphor with YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> over a blue LED is the simplest way of increasing the CRI while reducing the CCT.
