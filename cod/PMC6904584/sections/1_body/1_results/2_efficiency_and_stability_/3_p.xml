<p id="Par9">The significantly improved spectrum stability in PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films with 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> compared with 3D perovskite materials was ascribed to the dramatically suppressed ion migration in these films, as phase segregation occurs via ion migration

 </sup>. To verify it, we studied the activation energies of ionic conduction in both CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> and PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films using an established method
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>, the ion conduction activation energy of 3D CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film in the dark is around 0.26 eV, which is consistent with previously reported values
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. In striking contrast, we found that ionic conduction is negligible in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>(1:1) film in the temperature range up to 350 K. The derived small activation energy of 0.04 eV can be assigned to electronic conduction. This indicates that the ion migration in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>(1:1) films is significantly suppressed by the presence of layered perovskites, consistent with a previous study

 </sup>. In addition, adding 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in 3D CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film also increased ion migration activation energy from 0.26 eV to 0.75 eV.
