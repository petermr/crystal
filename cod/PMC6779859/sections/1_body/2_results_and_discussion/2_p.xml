<p>The reason behind the overall energy splitting at zero field, i.e., the loss of isotropy, is found in the mixing between ground and excited multiplets with 
 <italic>L</italic> ≠ 0. Indeed, the first-principles treatment of 
 <bold>1</bold>, which consists in solving a Schrödinger-like equation where all multiplets are included into the so-called full Hamiltonian, would reveal that the lowest eight wave-functions depend on both ground and excited multiplets. In Equation (1), we are only considering the ground multiplet, whereas all the effects derived from its interaction with excited multiplets come effectively encoded in 
 <italic>D</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic>. This is what defines the Crystal Field Approximation, where the low-lying energy level scheme of the full Hamiltonian is projected onto an effective spin Hamiltonian which depends only on spin degrees of freedom, while the effects derived from spin-orbit coupling are encoded in the anisotropy parameters. Note that in case of 
 <bold>1</bold> the zero-field energy splitting is much smaller as compared to similar compounds with a different lanthanide ion (Shiddiq et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, excited multiplets might be high enough in energy to assume that the lowest energy levels are well-isolated and hence safely define three qubits.
