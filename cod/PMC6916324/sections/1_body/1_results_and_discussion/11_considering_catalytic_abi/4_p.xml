<p>Looking at the other lattice planes from a similar point of view, plane (110) shows similar properties to (011), but all Co‐atoms are slightly deeper embedded in the surface thus they are much more difficult to be reached by the butanol oxygen atom. At the (10‐1) face exclusively five‐ and sixfold coordinated cobalt atoms are exposed. Due to the solemnly electronically depleted sites at this surface, the chemisorption of a molecule with both, electron‐rich and electron‐poor regions like butan‐2‐ol is much more difficult (Figure 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).The slightly positive σ‐hydrogen atom H
 <sup>3</sup> (Scheme 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-fig-5001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) would probably not find a more basic nearby phosphate site to be activated. The (101) plane also displays Co‐atom pairs with short metal–metal distances but they occur between five‐ and sixfold coordinated Co atom. Furthermore, they are not as well arranged as at the (011) plane. Hence, we conclude that (011) plane is the catalytically most active.
