<p id="Par5">In this work, the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires and α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets were assembled successively 
 <italic>in situ</italic> on the surface of nickel foam by the two-step low temperature oscillation method, resulting in the successful preparation of 3D hierarchical α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction nanorods. The complementary advantages of conduction features and synergistic effect of deformation stress between α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> endow the as-constructed heterojunction nanorods with high utilization rate and structural stability. The 3D highly conductive performance of nickel foam and 3D hierarchical structure of heterojunction composites construct an efficient electronic and ion transport network around the electrode materials. This ingenious design ensures α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction nanorods with a high capacitance retention rate of single electrode between three-electrode system and two-electrode system (the capacitance retention rate is 93.4% at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and long cycle life (the capacitance retention rate is 123.6% at 5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> for 10000 cycles). In addition, the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>//AC device also exhibits excellent rate performance (the capacitance retention rate is 70.2% from 1 to 20 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and idea energy density and power density (72.6 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> at 196.4 W kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and 40.9 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> at 3491.8 W kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). The synthesis procedure is relatively very simple yet allows the formation of heterojunction nanorods with excellent comprehensive performance, which is interesting for large-scale production and utilization in supercapacitors.
