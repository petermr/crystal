<p>In the present mini-review, we show recent development in the field of lead-free perovskite materials application in light-emitting devices. In the ‘synthesis’ section, we discuss in detail different synthetic approaches of fabrication lead-free perovskites with a focus on chemical composition and resulting morphology of materials. In the ‘lasing systems’ section, we discuss the morphology of perovskite materials utilized in the lasing devices with varied resonator’ architecture. In the last section, we discuss recent progress in LED and lasing technologies over the last five years. Finally, we give perspectives of the development of the lead-free perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.</p>
