<p id="p0035">The objects of the present study are the composition of the binary system of (1-
 <italic>x</italic>)NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> – 
 <italic>x</italic>Ca
 <sub>2</sub>Nb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> with 
 <italic>х</italic> = 0.10 (NCN0.10), 0.25 (NCN0.25), 0.55 (NCN0.55), 1.00 (NCN1.00), characterizing different parts of the phase diagram (PD) system. The samples have been obtained by the method of solid-phase reaction, followed by sintering according to the usual ceramic technology. The initial reagents were NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, Nb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> and CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> with the content of the main substance not lower than 99.9 %. The supplier of the raw materials is LLC “Rostekhnohim”, Russia. The synthesis was performed in two stages with intermediate grinding of the samples. The temperature of the first synthesis was 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 1220–1250 K, the temperature of the second synthesis was 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 1370–1470 K (depending on composition), the time of the isothermal holding was 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 4 h. Sintering of the samples was performed at the following temperatures: NCN0.10 – 
 <italic>Т</italic>
 <sub>sin</sub> = 1560 K, τ = 3 h, NCN0.25 and NCN0.55 – 
 <italic>Т</italic>
 <sub>sin</sub> = 1620 K, τ = 3 and 2.5 h, respectively, NCN1.00 – 
 <italic>Т</italic>
 <sub>sin</sub> = 1650 K, τ = 2.5 h. In order to avoid losses of volatile components, the samples were baked during the synthesis and sintering in closed crucibles in the presence of the back filling (dispersed crystalline powder of the batch) of the same composition as the baked SS.
