<p>The mentioned structural elements only take the direct environment of selected sites into account and less localized interactions, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the relative orientation of neighbouring Al–Si diclusters or its effect on the distortion of octahedra, are not analysed here. The analysis of the local environment should only be considered as a rough estimate of the stability of a certain Al/Si ordering pattern because these criteria are not enough to characterize the crystal chemistry of a certain Al/Si permutation. For example, M50 #18 is rather unstable but does not contain Al–Al diclusters or strongly overbonded oxygens.
