 <sub>4</sub>, and water equilibrated with Li-carbonate at room temperature including dilutions by 2/3 and 1/2) were heated to temperatures between 30 and 80 °C and measured using the 488 nm laser of a WITec 300 alpha Raman spectrometer. A 50× long working distance objective lens was used to focus below the sapphire window at the top of the cell. A grating of 600 grooves/mm was first used to obtain the complete spectral range of interest (100–4000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) for each temperature and solution. The most intense Raman band for the ions, which are known to be affected by the formation of ions pairs in solution,

 </sup> were then obtained at a higher spectral resolution using a 2400 grooves/mm grating. Each spectrum was acquired for 5–60 s 10 times and integrated to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Individual crystals from the precipitation experiments were also tested using the same Raman spectrometer. However, to reduce fluorescence of the solid samples, a Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm was used for the analysis of the precipitates with a grating of 600 grooves/mm. Each spectrum of the solids was acquired for 1 s, 15 times and integrated. Data reduction including the removal of spectral background and spurious detector noise was conducted using the WITec Project 4.0 program. The Raman bands were fitted using Voigt functions in the Fityk program.
