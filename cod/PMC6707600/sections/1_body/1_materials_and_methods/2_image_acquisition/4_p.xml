<p>Endochondral ossification was assessed according to modified Streeter’s classification (1949), which was based on the histological observation of the humerus [

Briefly, phases of endochondral ossification (phases 1–3, phase 4, and phase 5 according to Streeter’s classification and initiation of ossification [phase OS]) could be discerned by signal intensity and its distribution on MR images. Ossified regions (phase OS) exhibited low signal intensity or a mixture of low and high signal intensity, whereas phase 5 regions showed high signal intensity. Phase 4 regions showed low signal intensity; however, the border at the epiphysis from phases 1 to 3 was ambiguous.
