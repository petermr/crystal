   <sub>3</sub>(AlF)
   <sub>2</sub>Si
   <sub>3</sub>O
   <sub>12</sub> from Crowsnest Pass loaded in a 6 mm V can and measured for 2.6 h in the sample changer using a center wavelength of 2.665 Å at room temperature. Light-green dots represent measured data, the black line is the model fit to the data and the olive line is the difference curve. Tick marks show the locations of the expected Bragg peaks. (
   <italic>b</italic>) Refinement of high-resolution data collected at beamline 11BM at APS from the same sample. The same 
   <italic>d</italic>-spacing range is chosen for both plots to show a comparison of the resolution.
