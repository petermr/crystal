<p>An experiment is scripted using a table scan, where each line contains information about the desired parameters for a single run, such as temperature or wavelength, and the counting criteria. Each line is executed sequentially and additional table scans may be queued. POWGEN can count based on real time, which is useful for kinetics studies and other time-dependent effects. More commonly, POWGEN counts based on cumulative beam power, also known as proton charge or pcharge, in order to prevent temporary beam outages from affecting the data. More details on data collection are available on the POWGEN web site at

For experiments where data are collected continuously during heating or cooling, a special ramping script is also available, which monitors the beam power and adjusts the temperature ramp rate as needed to ensure consistent statistics at all temperatures.
