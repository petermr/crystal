<p>In addition to the Kikuchi pattern, diffractogram Fig. 8(
 <italic>b</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref> shows a significant intensity enhancement in the center region. This originates from diffraction of the photoelectron wave at lattice planes parallel to the surface as sketched in (
 <italic>h</italic>). Actually, this constitutes the simplest case of quasi-1D diffraction and is equivalent to constructive forward scattering along atom rows perpendicular to the surface. At 3.370 keV, the final-state momentum along 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub>, corrected by the photon momentum according to equation (4)

 <bold>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </bold>
 <sub>f</sub> = 20.5
 <bold>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </bold>
 <sub>0001</sub>. This condition corresponds to the Bragg condition for constructive interference in normal emission [for details, see equation (6) of Schönhense 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2018
 <italic>a</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb64"> ▸</xref>)]. The enhanced intensity in the center of (
