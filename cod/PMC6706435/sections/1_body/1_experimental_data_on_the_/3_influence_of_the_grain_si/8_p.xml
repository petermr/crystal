 <sup>3</sup> deserves special discussion. When HE is pressed into the case for experiments, the plunger rests on the limiting rings thus providing the prescribed density. In this experiment, however, the plunger rested on the HE leading to the obtaining the maximum achievable at the pressing of a pure HE density. We can assume that the decrease of the duration to 36 ns is related to the maximum achievable crushing of HE particles due to the action of a high pressure and the similarity of the pore structure to charges with fine grains.
