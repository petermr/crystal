<p id="Par9">Droplets with a 20 μm diameter were prepared by injecting the photo-responsive cholesteric liquid crystals in a mixture of water and D
 <sub>2</sub>O enriched in tetradecyl-trimethylammonium bromide surfactant. The size dispersity of the droplets is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. D
 <sub>2</sub>O was used to match the density of the liquid crystal and thus prevent the droplets from floating or sinking.
