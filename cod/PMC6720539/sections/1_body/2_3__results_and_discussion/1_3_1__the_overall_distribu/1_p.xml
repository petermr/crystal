<p>The final configuration model can directly reflect the distribution of water molecules in the interlayer of montmorillonite. The Z-density distribution curves reflect the density distribution of each component in the direction of vertical montmorillonite surface in the interlayer. The combination can further study the distribution and relative position of water molecules in the interlayer of montmorillonite.</p>
