 <sub>8</sub> was synthesised by direct single-step synthesis from elements. Sulphur and vanadium powders were mixed with lumps of gallium. The mixture was heated slightly by infrared lamp to melt gallium and thereafter ground and mixed in an agate mortar. The reaction mixture was put into the silica glass ampoule previously filled with argon. The ampoule was evacuated by a rotary pump, filled with argon, again evacuated, filled with argon, finally evacuated to residual argon pressure of about 2 mbar and sealed. The ampoule with reaction mixture was slowly heated at a rate of 40 K/h to 1270 K in a chamber furnace, annealed for 7 days and cooled at 10 K/min. The slow heating is necessary to allow the reaction of sulphur, since at quick heating the high pressure of sulphur can burst the ampoule. Unlike the experience of other authors this single-step synthesis resulted in pure single-phase GaV
