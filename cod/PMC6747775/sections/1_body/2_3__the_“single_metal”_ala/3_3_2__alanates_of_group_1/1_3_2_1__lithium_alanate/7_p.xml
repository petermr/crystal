<p>LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> is a well-known hydrogen storage material due to its facile dehydrogenation, but practically impossible complete rehydrogenation at moderate conditions. Few examples of successful rehydrogenation were observed by transferring the dehydrogenated products to an organic solvent and then exposing them to a hydrogen atmosphere. Among the examples is the rehydrogenation in Me
 <sub>2</sub>O at room temperature, 100 bar hydrogen pressure, and 24 h stirring [
