<p id="Par20">Besides the control of nanowire morphology via drawing direction, the size of the nanowire is also tuneable by manipulating the relative position of neck-shaped ligament to the nanowire bottom. During the uniform growth, the neck-shaped ligament sits at the geometrical center of the nanowire cross section. If the ligament is displaced off the center by shearing the pulling tip, the uniform growth can be changed into non-uniform growth. This suggests that the ligament could be manipulated to tune the size/morphology of the nanowire, as shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>. In the first stage from 0 to 57.8 s in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>, the nanowire only grew uniformly in length by 132 nm, while its width stayed unchanged at 62 nm. To maintain uniform growth, two requirements need to be satisfied. On one hand, the neck has to sit near the geometrical center of the nanowire cross section, thus a steady manipulation is vital. On the other hand, it needs some barrier mechanism to prevent incoming atoms from flowing over to the side facets. In fact, at the edges between bottom facets and its vicinal side facets, the diffusing atoms encounter an Ehrlich–Schwoebel barrier
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>, and this energy barrier at the edge can act in a way similar to a dam to enclose the atomic re-deposition within the end facets. But when a leftward shift of the tip shears the neck by about 25 nm as indicated by the double-harpoon marking in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, the uniform growth in length was interrupted. The facet at the right side instantly started growing. As a result, the apparent diameter of the nanowire increased to 92 nm, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>. To better understand the relation between neck shear and thickening of the nanowire, the displacement of the tip in the pulling direction (

 <sub>tip</sub>), as well as the apparent diameter of the nanowire (Φ), are measured digitally and plotted versus the same time axis in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>. From the plot, the neck shears at 58 s, followed immediately by a 15 s (from 58 to 73 s) period of the increase of the apparent diameter. The thickening rate is measured to be 1.9 nm s
 <sup>−1</sup>. In the growth after 73 s, the apparent diameter stayed unchanged at about 92 nm, and the growing velocity is nearly constant at 4.0 nm s
 <sup>−1</sup>. These results indicate that shearing the neck region may lead to growth of the facet on the opposite side to the shear direction. After the shear, both the diameter and the pulling speed increase, implying dramatic rise in growth rate and the thin neck can still survive. Simple calculation shows that the atomic flux density

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>, we found that the apparent diameter of the neck decreases from 32 to 24 nm. The nanowire adapts this way, because thinner diameter reduces the distance of GB transport and leads to faster deposition.
