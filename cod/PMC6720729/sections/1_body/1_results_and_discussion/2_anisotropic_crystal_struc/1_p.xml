<p>The optical anisotropy of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> was characterized by ADRDM. The ADRDM measurements were conducted by measuring the normalized reflectance difference of two arbitrary orthogonal directions at normal incidence, which can provide a direct, accurate visualization of the anisotropy of low-symmetry 2D materials. In detail, when linearly polarized incident light impinges onto the 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> crystal, as expected, an obvious phase retardance (Δδ) and reflectance difference (Δ
 <italic>R</italic>) appears between the two optical axes. The significant reflectance difference along the
