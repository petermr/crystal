<p id="p0010">Zeolites form a large family of aluminosilicates which have been studied by mineralogists for more than 200 years [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The present-day understanding of the composition of silicate structures is based on the principles developed by Pauling. The primary unit is a tetrahedral complex consisting of cation Si
 <sup>4+</sup> tetrahedrally coordinated with four oxygen ions. The isomorphous substitution of Al
 <sup>3+</sup> for Si
 <sup>4+</sup> causes a negative charge density in the zeolite lattice. Zeolites are alumosilicates consisting of a three-dimensional network of tetrahedrons SiO
 <sub>4</sub> and AlO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>â€“</sup>, connected with one another by common oxygen atoms 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This charge is compensated by the exchanging ions of sodium, calcium and potassium.
