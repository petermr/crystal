 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(i–n)</xref>), interplanar distances for these four planes should be doubled in the η″ phase (
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(b</xref>)). Intersections of these four lattice planes (dark blue circles) then form a body-centered orthorhombic lattice with a doubled 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice dimension. Therefore, the unit cell of the motif structure of the η″ phase is assumed to belong to the body-centered orthorhombic system possessing a unit cell volume twice that of the η phase. However, the atomic arrangement in the FeAl
 <sub>2</sub> framework structure consisting of Fe and Al1 sites with full occupancy cannot be reproduced with any of the nine body-centered orthorhombic space groups (
 <italic>Immm</italic> and so on) listed in the 
 <italic>International Tables for Crystallography</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. Therefore, crystal symmetry of the motif structure in the η″ phase should be lower than body-centered orthorhombic (i.e. either monoclinic or triclinic). After symmetry considerations, we found it to be the base-centered monoclinic space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2
 <italic>/m</italic>, which is equivalent to the ‘quasi’ body-centered orthorhombic space group 
 <italic>I</italic>12/
 <italic>m</italic>1 (
 <italic>β </italic>≈ 90°) listed in the 
 <italic>International Tables for Crystallography</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. We have also confirmed that the base-centered space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2
 <italic>/m</italic> (
 <italic>β </italic>≈ 127°) has the highest symmetry among all possible space groups.
