<p>Herein, we report a photoresponsive coordination cage with ligands based on a first generation molecular motor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Cages with a Pd
 <sub>2</sub>L
 <sub>4</sub> composition are formed from bidentate bispyridyl ligands and Pd(II) ions with a square planar geometry, which have been widely studied [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The photochromic ligands can be switched between three states, forming separate discrete cage complexes, allowing cage-to-cage transformations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>). Interestingly, only homochiral cages are formed revealing that a chiral self-sorting process takes place. In addition, two of the cage isomers can bind a tosylate anion in solution by formation of a host–guest complex.
