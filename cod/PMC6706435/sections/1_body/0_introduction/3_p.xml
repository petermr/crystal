<p id="Par4">It is known that the charge preparation method, the charge structure, and the grain size influence significantly the reaction zone. The most prominent example is trinitrotoluene (TNT) for which the duration of the reaction zone for close densities but different preparation methods change from 0.33

 <sup>3</sup> differ by an order of magnitude (15–30 mm and 3–5 mm, correspondingly). Authors of the work
