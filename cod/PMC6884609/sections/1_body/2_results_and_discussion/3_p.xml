<p id="Par18">To examine the deformation mechanism of the (001) nanoplate in details, we investigated the atomic arrangements and the stress distribution. After relaxation at 1â€‰K, the potential energy of the nanoplate is released to a great extent by structure bending along the [110] direction, as discussed above. During the formation of this metastable state, no inter-layer diffusion of atoms is observed. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a presents the vertical view of its upper surface. Note that the situation in the other two atomic layers essentially resembles the one described in the following. From the analysis of the lattice structure, most atoms (except the ones colored in white) are identified to form (110) facets, i.e., the initial (001) lattice transforms into the most close-packed structure in bcc crystal and the reconstruction occurs. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, atoms in the adjacent facets are assigned to different colors. The unit cell of each facet is labeled by a green rectangle, in which the short yellow line indicates its respective [110] direction. As can be seen, these (110) facets, which are schematically illustrated in the lower right corner of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, are arranged in different orientations. The distribution is roughly in a symmetric fashion. Take one-fourth part of the total surface as an example, facets 1 and 2 basically align in parallel, and they are approximately perpendicular to facets 4 and 5. The atoms in facet 3 are slightly distorted to accommodate the lattices of both facets 1 and 2.
