<p>Hydrogen storage in solid materials is a relatively new branch of hydrogen technologies. It started during the ’60s of the last century with the systematic study of TiFe alloys and Mg [

 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The studies on hydrogen storage flourished with the spread of the use of mechanical milling to produce materials or precursors that exhibited improved properties regarding kinetics or thermodynamics [

 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another breakthrough was the discovery that certain Ti-compounds made the hydrogen storage/release reversible in NaAlH

 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Certainly, there are numerous materials that are potentially useful in hydrogen storage. Among them, the family of alanates stands out because of the high hydrogen content, rich chemistry, and the possibility of reversible storage [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alanates (or aluminohydrides) are robust materials; some of them are so well known that prototypes of storage tanks had been constructed (i.e., NaAlH
