 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the four kinds of polyethylene with different densities have obvious diffraction peaks at nearly the same position 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 21.42°, indicating that these four kinds of polyethylene have typical crystal structures. Moreover, from the image and data, it can be concluded that the diffraction peak intensities for four kinds of polyethylene are arranged from large to small: HDPE, MDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE. The crystallinity of the polymer is directly proportional to the diffraction peak intensity of the XRD. Hence, it can be concluded that the crystallinity of the four polymers is in the order (from large to small): HDPE, MDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE. The image results of XRD are completely consistent with the results obtained through the DSC data calculation. In this way, the crystallinity for four kinds of polyethylene with different densities can be determined in this experiment.
