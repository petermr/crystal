<p>The square root of the eigenvalues represents the vibrational frequencies of the lattice, which are spectroscopically observable. For this reason, calculated vibrational frequencies were used to verify that the candidate structures were stable (imaginary values indicate instability) and, as discussed in 
 <xref rid="doc1" ref-type="other">part 2 of this work</xref>, to experimentally confirm their correctness. Vibrational frequencies and eigenvectors for 
 <bold>form I</bold> and 
 <bold>II</bold> were computed by density functional theory (DFT) methods with the CASTEP v6.1 (without dispersion correction) and VASP software (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package). The VASP calculations used the PBE exchange correlation functional in combination with projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.

 </sup> The effects of van der Waals (vdW) interactions were included with the computationally efficient pairwise D3-BJ method by Grimme.

 </sup> Whenever an imaginary frequency indicated that the stationary point was a saddle, nearby minima were easily reached by repeating the optimization after perturbing the system along the eigenvector of the mode with imaginary frequency.
