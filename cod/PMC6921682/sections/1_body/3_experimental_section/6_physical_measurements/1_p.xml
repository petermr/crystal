 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECS 400 MHz spectrometer. All peaks were referred to the proton signal of Si(CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> at δ = 0.00. Solid-state reflectance UV–vis spectra were measured by a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer equipped with an integration sphere, and a sample was placed between two silica glass plates. IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FTIR-4100. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected on a RIGAKU Rint 2000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) with a scan rate of 1°/min(5 ≤ 2θ ≤ 50°). Corrected emission spectra excited at 400 nm were measured by an absolute emission quantum yield measurement system (Hamamatsu C9920-02) composed of an integrating sphere, a multichannel photodetector (Hamamatsu Photonics, PMA-12), and a xenon lamp as an excitation light source. For emission lifetime measurements, a solid sample was placed between two nonfluorescent glass plates. A pulsed Nd
 <sup>3+</sup>:YAG laser (Lotis TII Ltd., 355 nm, fwhm ∼6 ns or continuum, 355 nm, fwhm 4–6 ns) was used as an excitation light source. The emission lifetime was measured by using a streak camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, C4334) or a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R928) monitored by a digital oscilloscope (IWATSU, DS-5532A). A liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> cryostat (DN1704 optical Dewar and 3120 temperature controller, Oxford Instruments) was used to control the sample temperature. The pictures of luminescence were taken under irradiation of UV light at 365 nm using a UV lamp (Vilber, VL-6.LC).
