 <p>The data illustrates the process of creation of dislocation quadrupoles in FCC Al. The density of dislocations in our data is 3.8 × 10
  <sup>13</sup> m
  <sup>−2</sup> which is the lowest published to date and is comparable to the density of dislocations in real crystals. The data set can be found at the following URL:
