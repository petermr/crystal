 <caption> Rietveld fitting of the XRD patterns for melt spun Al-9.7% Sm ribbon at 464 K, showing the crystallization products of the cubic ε-Al 60Sm 11, fcc-Al and the tetragonal η-Al 41Sm 5. The vertical lines in magenta, cyan, and navy show the diffraction peak positions for ε-Al 60Sm 11, Al and η-Al 41Sm 5, respectively. The fitting of the experimental data gives wRp = 0.0577 and Rp = 0.0398, where wRp and Rp are the weighted and unweighted profile R-factors, respectively 26 . </caption>
