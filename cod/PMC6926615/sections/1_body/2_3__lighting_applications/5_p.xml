<p>Besides lead-free films and powders, nanomaterials with perovskite crystal structure also have found their lighting applications. Xiangtong Zhang et al., at the end of 2018, published a letter [
 <xref rid="B75-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] on lead-free 2D Ruddlesden−Poppertype (C
 <sub>18</sub>H
 <sub>35</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SnBr
 <sub>4</sub> perovskite with high PLQY up to 88% in solution and 68% in the film. The 2D perovskites were synthesized by a hot injection method and passivated by oleylamine cations. Obtained films were further implemented as active media in the inverted orange LED showing a low turn-on voltage of 2.2 V and a luminance of 350 cd m

 <xref rid="B76-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] reported on synthesis of 2D (octylammonium)
 <sub>2</sub>SnX
 <sub>4</sub> (X = Br, I) with &gt;80% chemical yield produced by simple heating of the precursors in acid solution in ambient conditions. The synthesized material possesses 600 nm emission with near-unity PLQY. The position of the PL peak can be also tuned by halide exchange. This novel material was further used as a phosphor in down-conversion LED with white light emission (
