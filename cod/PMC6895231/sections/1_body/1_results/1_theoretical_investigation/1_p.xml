<p id="Par9">To assess the orientation determination ambiguity and error we have performed simulations on Si. Si has cubic symmetry (O
 <sub>h</sub> crystal class) and is well investigated by PRM

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), (110) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and (111) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) planes. The orientation determination results were obtained by fitting Euler angles to simulated data and were represented in a crystallographic color code using MTEX toolbox for Matlab
