<p>To visualize real‐space analogs of the electronic bands from the periodic DFT calculations, we calculated maximally localized Wannier functions centered on the Co atoms. The resulting MLWFs had clear connections to the d‐orbital populations, as well as the locations of the negative charge‐depletion regions and VSCCs around the Co ions. Given that all five spin‐up d‐orbitals are occupied, they form a roughly spherical ED. The two spin‐down orbitals add to the ED in particular directions, as can be seen from a comparison between the spin‐down MLWFs and the VSCCs.</p>
