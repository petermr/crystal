<p>In APT, we have two distinct coordinate systems, namely, the specimen space and detector space. The former is defined as the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of the reconstructed atoms, whereas the latter is defined as the ion impact position on the detector. Detector hit maps are 2D histograms of the raw ion impact positions on the detector, where the color indicates the number of ions which have hit the detector within a two-dimensional bin, i.e. pixel. The detector hit coordinates are contained within a data file (usually .
 <italic>epos</italic>), which also contains their corresponding 3D coordinates within the tomographic reconstruction. Due to their intrinsically different field evaporation behaviour that causes slight trajectory aberrations, microstructural features appear as variations in the hit density. Once a feature has been located on the detector, it should be possible to filter out the points that are associated to this specific feature.
