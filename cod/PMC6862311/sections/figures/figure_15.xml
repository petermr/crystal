  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic view of a single PbS nanoparticle with the shape of a truncated cube with six 100 and eight 111 facets, and the chemical structure of the tetrathiafulvalenedicarboxylate (TTFDA) anion; (
   <bold>b</bold>) Structure of a mesocrystal formed by PbS nanoparticles crosslinked with TTFDA molecules; (
   <bold>c</bold>) Scheme of the diffraction experiment, in which small angle scattering from the mesocrystal superlattice and wide angle scattering from PbS atomic scattering were recorded simultaneously by a large 2D detector. (Adapted with permission from Zaluzhnyy et al. [
