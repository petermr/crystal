Here, we exploit our recent advances in structure-refinement methodology to demonstrate how such models can be derived directly from simultaneous fitting of 3D diffuse- and total-scattering data, and we use this approach to elucidate the complex nanoscale atomic correlations in the classical relaxor ferroelectric PbMg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (PMN). Our results uncover details of ordering of Mg and Nb and reveal a hierarchical structure of polar nanoregions associated with the Pb and Nb displacements. The magnitudes of these displacements and their alignment vary smoothly across the nanoregion boundaries. No spatial correlations were found between the chemical ordering and the polar nanoregions. This work highlights a broadly applicable nanoscale structure-refinement method and provides insights into the structure of PMN that require rethinking its existing contentious models.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The understanding of relaxor ferroelectrics is hindered by the complexity of nanoscale perturbations of their structure.

Glasses or amorphous matter lack structural coherence beyond the first few nearest neighbors, whereas in crystals the disorder exists as a perturbation of an otherwise periodic atomic array. Because of disorder, the local structure&#x02014;a term that refers to atomic arrangements on a scale ranging from sub-nanometer to several nanometers&#x02014;differs from the average. Evidence grows that such fine details of crystal structures, which are largely overlooked by traditional crystallographic methods, control the functional responses of many advanced technological materials. Therefore, the ability to consistently and accurately characterize local structure on the relevant length scales becomes critical for the informed design of materials for applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Relaxor ferroelectrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> are a classical example of systems with properties controlled by nanoscale atomic order that has remained ill-understood despite over a half century of intense studies using the most advanced measurement and computational techniques. Lead magnesium niobate, PbMg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (PMN), and its solid solutions, which exhibit highly attractive piezoelectric characteristics, have been and remain at the center of the quest to understand the structural origins of the relaxor behavior. PMN crystallizes with a perovskite-like structure featuring a nanoscale ordering of Mg and Nb. The polarizable Nb and Pb cations are offset from their respective centrosymmetric positions, thus yielding local electric dipoles. While on average the PMN structure exhibits cubic symmetry (retained down to at least 5&#x02009;K), such polar cation displacements are correlated over a local range; however, the exact nature of these correlations and their relations to the underlying short-range chemical order remain contentious.</p><p id="Par5">Most commonly, the displacement correlations in PMN are perceived to be manifested as polar nanoregions (PNR), several nanometers in size, which emerge below the so-called Burns temperature of &#x02248;620&#x02009;K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and are widely regarded as a key feature associated with the relaxor behavior. A formal definition of PNRs is missing but typically this term refers to finite-size regions, dynamic or static, having nonzero spontaneous electrical polarization. A large fraction of structural research on PMN has involved X-ray and neutron-scattering measurements on single crystals, with a focus on the interpretation of the rich diffuse-scattering patterns in terms of displacement correlations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; this diffuse scattering appears below the Burns temperature and becomes increasingly pronounced as temperature is reduced. Various models of PNRs that could give rise to these patterns have been proposed, ranging from static nanodomains having well-defined shapes and boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> to dynamic displacement patterns controlled by acoustic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and/or optical phonon modes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Some works suggested that the PNRs are distributed in a disordered paraelectric matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, whereas recent molecular-dynamics studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> have rejected this interpretation, claiming instead that PNRs are separated by domain walls. Similarly, while some computational studies associate the PNRs with chemically ordered regions (COR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, others question this relation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The debate continues in part because no comprehensive structural model of PMN that would provide at least a snapshot of the multiscale correlated disorder, while also accounting for all the available experimental data, has been reported thus far.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we use PMN to demonstrate an approach for obtaining fully atomistic nanoscale structural models directly from the experimental data. We employ large atomic ensembles and a Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm to simultaneously fit multiple types of diffraction and spectroscopic data, which notably include three-dimensional (3D) X-ray diffuse-scattering intensity distributions. Our results confirmed the rocksalt-type random-site chemical ordering of Mg and Nb and revealed a continuous distribution of the order parameter, with its nanoscale spatial fluctuations yielding regions of stronger order. The displacements of both Pb and Nb are aligned preferentially with the &#x02329;111&#x0232a; directions and occur cooperatively over the nanoscale, forming polar 3D clusters. The arrangement of these clusters is nonrandom, resulting in aggregate PNRs that incorporate several inequivalent &#x02329;111&#x0232a; clusters. The local alignment of displacements in such PNRs is maintained over an extended range, but the preferred alignment direction varies within a given region. The displacement magnitudes are largest near the PNR centers and decrease monotonically toward their boundaries, with a smooth transition from one PNR to another. No disordered non-polar matrix could be identified. The magnitudes of the Pb displacements are enhanced as the local Mg/Nb ratio increases; however, no spatial correlations between the PNRs and the much smaller CORs could be observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reconstructing the nanoscale structure from the diffraction data</title><p id="Par7">We modeled the PMN structure at 300&#x02009;K and 200&#x02009;K using atomic configurations of 40&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40 perovskite unit cells (320,000 atoms, 16&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x02009;nm), which sample interatomic distances up to 8&#x02009;nm (see the Methods section).

In addition, we included the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data for Pb and Nb to provide chemical resolution.

We started with a random distribution of Mg and Nb on the octahedral sites and fitted these 3D peaks while swapping the locations of the two cations according to the RMC procedure.

The order parameter for the first coordination sphere is at &#x02248;70% of its maximum possible value. Similar results were obtained by starting with a rocksalt-type ordered arrangement of Nb and Mg instead of their random distribution.</p><p id="Par11">We used a local short-range ordering metric, <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>, calculated similarly as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, to visualize a spatial distribution of the ordered regions. A 3D map of this metric for the refined configuration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) reveals the CORs, which appear as the quenched spatial fluctuations of the order parameter, while the degree of ordering varied continuously across the system. We compared our results with those inferred from the experimental STEM images by calculating a (110) projection of our configuration box, with the projected atomic columns assigned intensities according to their average atomic numbers (<italic>Z</italic>) squared. The resulting image, which we call a <italic>Z</italic>-map, approximates the <italic>Z</italic>-contrast in STEM high-angle annular dark-field images (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). The Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of this <italic>Z</italic>-map yields the &#x000bd;&#x000bd;&#x000bd;-type superlattice diffuse spots like those obtained experimentally. Comparison of the calculated map and the experimental image, both FFT-filtered using these spots, demonstrates their qualitative agreement (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Moreover, a map of the 2D ordering metric (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), calculated exactly as suggested in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, closely matches a similar map obtained by these authors from the experimental images (the thickness of their TEM samples was comparable with the dimension of our configuration box along the projection direction). Therefore, we concluded that the presently obtained models accurately represent the state of ordering in PMN and have adopted them for further refinements of atomic displacements (performed without any swap moves); the same Mg/Nb distribution was used for both 300&#x02009;K and 200&#x02009;K since the metal-ion diffusion at these temperatures is negligible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cation displacements and PNRs</title><p id="Par12">Partial metal&#x02013;oxygen PDFs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) calculated from the refined atomic coordinates confirm that both Pb and Nb are off-centered within the respective oxygen coordination polyhedra (cuboctahedra for Pb and octahedra for Nb), while Mg remains approximately central. The double-peak Pb&#x02013;Mg and single-peak Pb&#x02013;Nb distributions indicate much stronger off-centering of Pb relative to its Mg neighbors as compared with Nb, which is in line with the recent inferences from quantitative STEM imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. On average, all the cations retain their ideal cubic positions. Locally, however, both Pb and Nb atoms are displaced preferentially along the &#x02329;111&#x0232a; directions, and this preference becomes more pronounced on cooling from 300&#x02009;K to 200&#x02009;K (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b;</xref> Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>); the displacements of Mg appear to be isotropic.

In fact, competition between long-range electrostatic and short-range Pb&#x02013;O interactions could be a reason for favoring a partially ordered 1:1 type array of Mg and Nb over the completely ordered 1:2 layered arrangement. Thus, the existence of a relationship between the degree of Mg/Nb ordering and at least the static Pb displacements is chemically reasonable. We do observe that the overall Pb displacements in the instantaneous configuration are enhanced in the cores of CORs if only slightly; the small magnitude of this effect is determined by the continuously varying degree of ordering (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> for a detailed analysis).</p><p id="Par15">The 3D Pb-displacement correlations in the form of dense nanoscale regions are evident from considering the local alignment metric, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, defined as the average of the angles between the displacement vectors of a given atom and each of its neighbors within a sphere of a certain radius.

This result resonates with the assessment by Takenaka et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, who attributed the diffuse scattering in PMN to a multidomain state. We investigated the nature of such a multi-domain state by performing an inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the calculated diffuse-scattering amplitude around the Bragg peaks (spherical masks 0.2&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in diameter were used). Extensive testing using simulated structures demonstrated that IFT successfully recovers regions of correlated displacements and the displacement patterns that underlie specific diffuse-scattering features.

The reconstructed chemical and displacive nanoscale ordering in PMN agrees well with the reported STEM images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, which attests to the fidelity of the present structural models and of the information that can be extracted from quantitative STEM measurements. The obtained atomistic picture invalidates the notion of chemical or polar-ordered regions dispersed in a disordered matrix, instead suggesting continuously varying order parameters. The displacements of Pb and Nb atoms at both 300&#x02009;K and 200&#x02009;K exhibit preference for the &#x02329;111&#x0232a; directions, in contrast to previously proposed spherical-shell distributions. The &#x02329;111&#x0232a; displacements are spatially correlated, but an additional higher-level correlation exists that is manifested in a preference for neighboring &#x02329;111&#x0232a; clusters to represent 71&#x000b0; variants, resulting in a hierarchical assembly of PNRs; displacement-magnitudes follow this latter correlation. Preference for the 71&#x000b0; variants has also been noted in the most recent MD simulations of PMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which together with our results point to the significance of this effect. Consistent with the previously made inferences, the PNRs grow on cooling to 200&#x02009;K. In addition, nanoscale regions with ordered antiparallel Pb displacements are shown to exist alongside the PNRs. While we observe no spatial coincidence between the PNRs and CORs, chemical ordering is still expected to affect the behavior of polar displacements, as can be inferred from the dependence of Pb displacements on the local Mg/Nb ratio. Our results suggest that the existing models of PMN that ignore the continuously varying degree of chemical ordering and overlook the inter-PNR correlations should be reconsidered. Understanding the origins of the inter-PNR correlation, its evolution with temperature and chemical substitutions, and ultimately its significance for the dielectric response represent topics for future theoretical and experimental research on PMN and its solid solutions.

The currently used atomic configurations are still at the lower limit of what is required for accurate treatment of nanoscale correlations in systems like PMN. In fact, since the PNRs grow at 200&#x02009;K, this configuration-size already becomes insufficient.

This procedure, which involves an analysis of statistical correlations between changes in the aggregate residual function and each of its terms, drastically accelerates convergence of RMC refinements.</p><p id="Par33">For X-ray total scattering, the energy-integration range is always significantly broader than a span of phonon energies and therefore these data reflect instantaneous atomic positions. For EXAFS, a characteristic X-rays-sample interaction time is &#x02248;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>&#x02009;s thus also probing an instantaneous PDF. In the case of neutron total scattering, the actual energy-integration range is limited by the so-called Placzek shift and reportedly can be less than 10&#x02009;meV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, for a given material, the exact value of this limit will vary between different instruments and is somewhat uncertain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. According to previous studies of PMN using a dynamic PDF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, at <italic>T</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;450&#x02009;K, the off-centering of Pb, which is manifested in the splitting of the nearest-neighbor Pb&#x02013;O peak with the appearance of short Pb&#x02013;O distances at &#x02248;2.4&#x02009;&#x000c5;, is purely dynamic. Our variable-temperature X-ray PDF (X-PDF) data (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17a</xref>) demonstrate that this splitting and the short Pb&#x02013;O distances are observable at least up to 490&#x02009;K, as expected since X-ray total scattering reveals both static and dynamic correlations. Our neutron PDF (N-PDF) at 490&#x02009;K (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17b</xref>) also features a clearly identifiable splitting of the Pb&#x02013;O distribution with a peak at &#x02248;2.4&#x02009;&#x000c5;, as confirmed by the presence of anomalies in the second derivative of the PDF signal (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17c</xref>). Considering that the onset energy for a phonon that involves the off-centering of Pb is &#x02248;15&#x02009;meV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, we conclude that the integration range for our neutron total-scattering measurements extends at least past this energy, and thus the low-energy atomic vibrations are captured in the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Analyses of refined atomic configurations</title><p id="Par34">The 3D local cation-order metric used here to describe a distribution of Mg and Nb over the octahedral sites was defined by adopting an approach proposed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> to characterize the Mg/Nb ordering from atomic-resolution STEM images of PMN. In this work, the order metric has been equated with the coefficient of variation of intensities for the Mg/Nb columns surrounding a Pb column. For a disordered case, all the Mg/Nb columns have similar average atomic numbers/intensities, and the coefficient of variation is zero. In contrast, strong ordering yields large values of this metric. In this case, we defined the ordering metric, <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>, as <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;(<italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub>&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;+&#x02009;(<italic>n</italic><sub>4</sub>&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic><sub>3</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, where <italic>n</italic><sub>i</sub> is the fraction of, say, Nb atoms found in the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> coordination shell around a given B-cation (Nb or Mg) normalized to the fraction expected for this shell from the average concentration of Nb. The metric was calculated for each B-cation in the configuration. With this definition, clusters of the B-cations with large values of <italic>&#x003b7;</italic> represent chemically ordered regions.</p><p id="Par35">Inverse Fourier-transform filtering of the complex diffuse-scattering amplitude calculated from the refined atomic coordinates was performed by placing spherical masks with diameter 0.2&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> around the features of interest. The amplitude of this transform was calculated around each Pb atom on a grid with a mesh size of 0.05&#x02009;&#x000c5;. The atoms that provide the largest contribution to the diffuse scattering features used in the inverse Fourier transform are associated with the largest difference between the maximum and minimum amplitudes. The distance vector that corresponds to the spatial locations of these extrema reflects a component of the atomic displacement that participates in the correlations yielding the diffuse feature of interest.</p><p id="Par36">Distortions of the oxygen octahedral framework from an ideal configuration were characterized by introducing a set of deformation modes for the oxygen octahedra. For a more intuitive interpretation, the modes were selected to mimic both typical lattice distortions (e.g., tetragonal, orthorhombic) and vibrational modes (rotations, bending) while providing a complete orthonormal basis. The resulting modes are depicted in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>, whereas their corresponding coordinate-transformation matrices for cubic symmetry are summarized in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. All the modes, except for the tetragonal, preserve an octahedron&#x02019;s volume. The orthorhombic and rotational modes describe oxygen coordinates adequately within the limits of the small-angle (linear) approximation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
