<p id="Par22">The helical motion of spiral droplets in surfactant-rich water is determined by their handedness (which defines the handedness of the helical motion) and by the confinement of the liquid crystal helix in the droplets (which defines the pitch and radius of the trajectories). The system features transmission of chirality across length scales: the chirality of the molecular motors is transmitted to the spiral organization of the liquid crystal in the droplets, which is in turn transmitted into a chiral trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate that when the chiral dopants used to make the droplets are light-driven molecular motors, the light-induced inversion of handedness operated by the motor is associated with a deterministic reorientation of the droplets. Key to the emergence of directionality in response to light is the possibility of a dynamic conversion between right-handed and left-handed trajectories. The chirality-derived and deterministic reorientation of the spiral droplets shows similarities with the motile behavior of unicellular organisms
