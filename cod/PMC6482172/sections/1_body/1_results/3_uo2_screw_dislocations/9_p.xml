 </inline-formula>0]) directions around the core of a 〈110〉 screw dislocation in MgO were obtained from calculations using both the Buckingham potential and DFT. The agreement between the two types of simulations is excellent at zero external pressure, validating the choice of the pairwise potentials. In addition, it is shown in this paper that the calculated generalized stacking fault energy using the potential almost overlaps with the result from DFT at zero external pressure. Such agreement suggests that, at ambient pressure, the dislocation behavior in MgO can be modelled with the Buckingham potential with reasonable fidelity. In UO

That is, using the SMTB-Q model we find the dissociated vacancy structure to be a local minimum in the potential energy landscape, indicating that the result using the Morelon potential is not an artifact of the potential.
