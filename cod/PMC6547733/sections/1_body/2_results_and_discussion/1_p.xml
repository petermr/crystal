<p id="Par10">The monoclinic LTO structure is a layered perovskite crystal containing TiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra linearly connected, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>. In contrast, the cubic pyrochlore LZO crystal contains ZrO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra inter-connected by corners in a zigzag fashion. A comparison of the two crystals in their respective ground state structure indicates that the monoclinic LTO is 0.325 eV/atom less energetically favorable than the cubic LZO, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>. In the case where a monoclinic perovskite structure is made of 100% Zr atoms (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., monoclinic LZO) it would be 0.039 eV/atom less favorable than its ground state cubic LZO structure. Similarly, if a cubic pyrochlore crystal was made of 100% Ti atoms (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., cubic LTO), its energy would be 0.055 eV/atom less favorable than that of the monoclinic LTO crystal. The general trend shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref> is that the incorporation of Zr in both crystal structures leads to more energetically favorable phases. For both the monoclinic and cubic crystals, SQS structures have been generated to find compositionally intermediate structures with the most appropriate [Ti, Zr] distributions that mimic, for a small number of atoms, the first few, physically most relevant radial correlation functions of a perfectly random structure. Using this method enables us to investigate the effect of progressive [Ti, Zr] mixing on electronic excitation induced amorphization. Among the SQS structures generated for 25%, 50% and 75% of Zr (calculated from the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site only), only those with the lowest energy have been reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>. The energy diagram shows that the phase transition from monoclinic perovskite to cubic pyrochlore should occur for 53% of Zr in the monoclinic LTO structure. It is worth noting that the structures at 50% [Ti, Zr] mixing have very similar energies but different crystal structures. In the following, we have focused our investigations on the most energetically stable structures at any given composition, mainly by considering only a monoclinic layered perovskite phase for compounds with a Zr fraction ≤50% and a cubic pyrochlore phase for compounds with a Zr fraction ≥50%. At a Zr fraction of 50% both phases have been investigated.
