<p>Soft matters or complex fluids have drawn tremendous attention from condensed matter researchers because of some useful features such as complexity in their various forms or structures and flexibility in changing their physical properties through simple chemical modification [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Block copolymers, or polymeric surfactants, are one particular soft matter that is produced by covalently joining two or more different homopolymers. In many cases, disparity in their own cohesive energies leads them to nanoscale self-assembly behaviors [
