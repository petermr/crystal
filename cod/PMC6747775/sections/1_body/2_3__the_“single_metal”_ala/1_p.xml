<p>In this section, experimental and theoretical “single metal” alanates are described. They are ordered in groups according to the periodic table. Alane was also included. At the end of this section, the binary (double cations) alanates are presented. Some of them are well-known, while others are barely developed. This section presents the essential characteristics of synthesis, dehydrogenation reactions, and temperatures, crystallographic data, crystal structures, expected X-ray diffraction patterns, and, in some cases, phase diagrams. </p>
