<p>There are many localized states in the forbidden band gap of the polymer. These localized states can capture the carriers in the material to form a space charge, which acts as a trap. Therefore, the localized state is also called a trap. Space charge is sometimes referred to as trapped charge. Traps are mainly caused by crystal imperfection, caused by structural defects or impurities, or both. Traps are roughly divided into two types, mainly formed by structural defects or chemical defects. It is generally believed that discrete trapping levels are associated with chemical impurities doped in the lattice, and quasi-continuous trapping levels are related to imperfections of crystal structure [
