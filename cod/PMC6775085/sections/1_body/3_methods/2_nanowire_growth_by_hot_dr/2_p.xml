 <sup>−1</sup>. The cold tungsten tip was manipulated to touch the edge of hot aluminum foil to expose fresh metal surface by breaking the native oxide layer. Then the cold tungsten tip was pulled backward in a stepped manner with a speed of a few nanometers per second. The nanowire growth process was observed and recorded by Gatan OneView camera at 5 frames per second. The tip movement was retrieved from the video by tracking a selected feature on the nanowire or tip with the commercial software of Adobe After Affect. The output is a trajectory in pixel coordinates, which can be converted into nanometers using scale bar, thus the instant velocity at any given time can be obtained.
