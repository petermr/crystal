 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, configurations belonging to the amorphous and liquid classes displayed thermodynamic a smooth temperature dependence in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Therefore, a final top down analysis of these two types of configurations was performed with the EM algorithm to yield a first layer of a hierarchical clustering

 </sup>. The amorphous class displayed a sharp split of samples into two sub-clusters. By identifying each sample with its temperature during the simulation, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> illustrates visually the results. The crossing region between130–170 K was identified as the amorphous system transitioning to a volume-arrested amorphous solid. The liquid class displayed a softer split of samples into two clusters, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>. The crossing region between 220–300 K was identified as temperatures where the system was pre-melting and melting. Since the SMA potential of the pure metals predict melting temperature higher than experiment

 </sup>, it is expected that the alloy melting region spreads beyond the experimental 260 K. The system behavior in these transition regions was embedded in the attributes used, which we chose not to inspect before applying the latest clustering. The Appendix includes the temperature behavior of ten top attributes.
