<p id="Par15">To estimate the real temperature distribution, inputting physically plausible 
 <italic>κ</italic> in the neck ligament and nanowire is critical, which has to consider two effects, the contribution from the surface mass transport and the quantum size effect. First, we estimated the effective additional thermal conductivity from surface mass transport, as described in Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>. The results show that the extra heat conduction from off-diagonal contribution is at least four magnitudes smaller than the on-diagonal bulk value, so that its effect is numerically negligible. For the quantum size effect, the thermal conductivity has a strong size effect at the nanoscale regime, when the geometrical size approaches the electron mean free path (

 </sup> or the phonon mean free path (

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. The size of nanowire and the neck ligament is close to

 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>, so that the thermal conductivity in both the neck and the nanowire can be much smaller than the bulk value

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>, thermal conductivity at the neck and nanowire was estimated to be 40 and 75 W m
 <sup>−1</sup> K
 <sup>−1</sup> (compared with bulk value of 
 <italic>κ</italic> &gt; 200 W m
 <sup>−1</sup> K
 <sup>−1</sup>). Based on these modified values, we performed FEM modeling and the results are detailed in Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>. From the FEM results, the real temperature gradient must be as high as 10

 <sup>−1</sup>. Thus, the real thermomigration driving force is about four orders of magnitude larger than the what it needs to be, if it runs unopposed (∇
