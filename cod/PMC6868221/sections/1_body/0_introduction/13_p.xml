<p id="Par14">The present results demonstrate the unexpected feasibility of forming a metastable state in a bulk engineering alloy during a nanostructuring process at room temperature to very high strains whereas the current technology of powder metallurgy and powder compaction through HPT introduces only a small volume of a metastable phase within bulk materials

 </sup>. In practice, a metastable phase involving amorphous structure is achievable after extreme straining by ultra-severe plastic deformation though HPT on several powder mixture and ingot Mg immiscible alloys
