 <caption> CSE correlates with DFT total energy. CSE as a function of the DFT total energy of the model structures of a Au 36(SR) 24 and b Ag 44(SR) 30 clusters. In both cases, 700 model structures that had the correct number of ligands were chosen for the analysis. CSE was calculated as an average over 0.4 eV energy range. For the calculation of the total energy, the SR-group was simplified with the SH-group as described in “Methods” </caption>
