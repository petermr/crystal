<p>A schematic diagram of the electrical conductivity test system is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f001">Figure 1</xref>. A Keithley 6517B electrometer/high resistance meter (Tektronix of Johnston, Ohio, USA) (minimum theoretical measurement accuracy 10–15 A) and a self-made three-electrode system (measuring electrode diameter 25 mm) were utilized in a vacuum environment (the pressure inside the vacuum box was 0.1 MPa). Pure LLPE, LDPE, MDPE, and HDPE with a thickness of 50 μm were measured. The conductivity of the field strength of 5–200 kV/mm was 30 min. Based on the LabView system, a computer accomplished the automation as follows: automatic control of the boost voltage; automatic data acquisition and storage of the high-voltage DC power supply, the 6517B high-resistance meter, and the controller; automatic control of the protection circuit. The voltage source had a step of 250V each time. For 30 min, when the pressurization time reached 30 min, the controller controlled the high-voltage relay to operate, and the 6517B high-impedance meter was connected to the measurement loop for a 30-second current test, collected 10 data per second, and finally selected the average value as the voltage. After measurement, the sample was short-circuited for 25 min. Although the literature indicates that the current steady-state needs to be maintained for several hours or several days [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it was found during the test that the current basically reached steady state during the process of pressurizing or depressurizing for 25 min. Thus, the influence of the previous low field strength and the pressurized residual charge on measurement under the subsequent high field strength is ignored. Subsequently, the controller controlled the action of the high voltage vacuum. The relay operated to continuously disconnect the 6517B high-resistance meter, and then pressurized again to repeat.
