<p>The TG and DTG of montmorillonites with different layer charge densities are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f009">Figure 9</xref>. The derivative thermogravimetric curve of montmorillonite shows two peaks. The first peak appears between 40–100 °C and this is the release temperature of the adsorbed water in the montmorillonite; the second peak appears between 100–200 °C and this is the precipitation temperature of the interlayer water in the montmorillonite. The reason for the different precipitation temperature of water molecules is that the interlayer water is hydrogen-bonded by Si-O surface, and the energy required for precipitation is higher than that of the adsorbed water. However, with the increase of temperature, the movement of interlayer water molecules is more severe, and the above-mentioned hydrogen bonding force formed by O
 <sub>t</sub> and H
 <sub>w</sub> is difficult to limit the movement of water molecules, thereby causing the interlayer water to precipitate.
