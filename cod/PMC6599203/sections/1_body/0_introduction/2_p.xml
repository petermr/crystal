<p id="Par3">Another important characteristic of the investigated material could be the orientation of the crystal structure within the optically inspected area. For example, optically uniaxial domains in crystals exist in several orientation variants that can be easily distinguished by polarisation sensitivity of Raman scattering. Also the crystal grain orientations in optically uniaxial polycrystalline materials can be determined by Raman scattering. In particular, the angle between the local principal optical axis and the sample surface normal can be calculated from the fine spectral shifts caused by dipole-dipole interaction among polar Raman modes (oblique phonon mode method)
