<p id="Par12">The NaK alloy system was NPT equilibrated at 101.325 kPa and a high temperature of 700 K. Next, the system was annealed at constant pressure resulting in two branches of the the enthalpy and system volume below 230 K, as shown in Fig.

 </sup>, which is predictable for a eutectic alloy. The lower enthalpy/volume branch was associated to crystalline packing. The higher enthalpy/volume branch corresponds to liquid states that were supercooled below 230 K and became an amorphous solid below approximately 140 K
