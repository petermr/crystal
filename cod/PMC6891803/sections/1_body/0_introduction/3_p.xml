<p>Epitaxial VANs are self-assembled through physical vapor deposition, without control of the deposition sequence, as is required for planar multilayer films. For epitaxially directed self-assembly, it is desirable that one phase in the film is structurally well-matched to the substrate such that it nucleates, grows epitaxially, and forms the host matrix. The second phase (epiphyte) epitaxially aligns with the matrix phase. Depending on surface energy considerations and the relative concentrations of the two components in the film, the epiphyte phase may or may not seed its growth on the substrate. The host and epiphyte can both be chosen to be active phases whose functional properties are of interest and where the phases interact with each other via strain- or charge-coupling at the interfaces. Dimensional tunability has been demonstrated, in which various nanopillar shapes and dimensions (2â€“200 nm) have been achieved in specific material systems.
