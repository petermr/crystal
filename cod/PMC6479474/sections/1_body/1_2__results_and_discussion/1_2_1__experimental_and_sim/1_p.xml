<p>The simulation of the IR spectrum of melamine in polycrystalline state requires a proper representation of the long-range ordered structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f001">Figure 1</xref>). There exists a decisive decrease in the accuracy for the IR spectrum calculated on the basis of finite model, even in anharmonic approximation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Such spectra are markedly poor and numerous bands are missing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D). In contrast, the spectrum that was calculated for infinite (3D periodic) model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) correctly reproduces all of the major experimental bands (

 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>, likely results foremost from neglecting the anharmonic effects that are typically strong in the X-H stretching region. However, this may be accurately corrected by employing wavenumber scaling. This observation may appear obvious; however, in light of NIR simulations (as discussed in
