<p>The elastic constants were determined as described in [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Simply, a strain was applied and the stress was calculated. The unit cell was fixed and only the internal coordinates were optimised. The matrix of the linear elastic constants was reduced depending on the crystal structure of the phases. For a cubic cell the maximum number of strain patterns (sets of distortions) is one, and for tetragonal or hexagonal cells two patterns are sufficient. Six strain steps (varying from −0.003 to 0.003) were used for each pattern to obtain a consistent linear fit of the stress–strain relationship [
