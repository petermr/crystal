<p id="p0085">The micro-XRF analysis of the ceramic samples has shown that standard deviations for the average concentrations of the elements do not exceed 1% in correspondence to the values derived from their chemical formulas (see the 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table.1</xref>). It confirms the specified ratios of cation concentration in the samples and preservation of composition stoichiometry, ensured by the chosen technology to produce solid solutions.
