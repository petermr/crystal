<p id="Par34">At 40.2(7) GPa, in addition to the standard data collection, we collected the diffraction when DAC was rotated around the X-ray beam direction by 90°. After the integration procedure, two reflection files were combined using program XRPEP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup> in order to increase data completeness and redundancy. In total, we collected 2051 reflections, which were merged based upon identical indices to 900 independent reflections with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>int</sub> = 7.42%. At 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.8 Å completeness of the data was 42.1%. The amount of the collected data allowed us to refine the structure only in an isotropic approximation. The resulting ratio between data (900) and the number of parameters (97) was ~9. Six reflections were omitted from the refinement due to overlap with diamond peaks. The final structure was refined to convergence with

 <sub>2</sub> = 24.76%, for those 789 data with

 <sup>−2</sup>. The most of the intense peaks were within 1 Å of the Si atoms. Values of thermal parameters of all atoms are within the normal interval (0.016–0.021 A
