<p>The use of a very similar amine hydrobromide additive (3-BPABr = 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide) results in a highly oriented film which shows the same preferential orientation along the (100) and the (200) plane shown using 3-CPACl. This corroborates the role of the propylic chain bound to a halide atom into the crystal growth. Diffraction peaks show a shift to higher 2θ values for the perovskite treated with 3-BPABr. In particular, (100) diffraction shifts from 13.89° to 14.09°, and (200) diffraction shifts from 28.09° to 28.29°, and the lattice parameter decreases to 6.2783 Å (

 </xref>a). This finding is also confirmed by the strong shift of the band gap to higher energy, indicating the incorporation of the bromide in the lattice as shown in

 </xref>b. The absorption edge of our perovskite containing Zn(II) and 3-CPACl is around 830 nm, in agreement with FA/MA Pb-based perovskite mostly containing FA and iodide. The absorption in the 750–830 nm region shows a significant enhancement, and we assume that the perovskite surface morphology and coverage induced by the presence of the film-forming agent play an important role in it.
