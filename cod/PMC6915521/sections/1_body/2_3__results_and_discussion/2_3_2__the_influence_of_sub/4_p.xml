<p>Due to the existence of the ball defects, the surrounding atoms reach a new equilibrium state to produce the lattice distortion, which changes the material properties. In addition, compared with the perfect substrate, the defects make the sliding process unstable, and atoms near the defects of the substrate collapse during the sliding process. For the substrate contains defects, the common neighbor analysis shows that the dislocations are more than those of perfect substrate, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f018">Figure 18</xref>. With the increase in dislocation density, the shear strength of material increases, which increases the dissipation energy required to break the bond between atoms during the sliding process, and the friction forces are increased when
