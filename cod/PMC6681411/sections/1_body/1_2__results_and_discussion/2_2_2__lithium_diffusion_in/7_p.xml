<p>Among several possibilities, we chose two for the movements of the Li atoms, i.e., within the layers or between the layers in LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02667-f006">Figure 6</xref>, which we found reasonable from the structural point of view. The calculated structural energy is plotted against the diffusion coordinates, which shows an energy barrier of about 202 meV for the intra-layer diffusion within the Liâ€“Al layers and 177 meV for the inter-layer diffusion path. Such low energy barriers may give rise to a high Li conductivity of partially delithiated Li
 <sub>1-x</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl
 <sub>1-x</sub> (0 &lt; x &lt; 1). Although the Li conductivity may not be the only factor that determines a battery performance, its high value strongly recommends the possibility of utilizing this compound as a lithium superionic conductor.
