 </sup>. We found suitable pararsenolamprite crystals for single crystal structure analysis in a specimen of parallel aggregates of bladed crystals from a National Science Museum sample (sample No.NSM-28015). The crystals are lead-like dark grey in colour and opaque with metallic lustre. The crystal samples have clear crystal faces and perfect cleavage. Pararsenolamprite is sectile and brittle with perfect cleavage on [001]. Euhedral crystals elongated on [010] and flattened on (001). A pararsenolamprite single crystal of dimensions 27 × 39 × 17 µm was cut and removed from euhedral crystal aggregate for use with single-crystal structure analysis. Its chemical composition of As
 <sub>0.97</sub>Sb
 <sub>0.03</sub> was determined by JEOL scanning electron microscope SEM JSM-7001F and Oxford energy dispersive X-ray analyser EDS INCA SYSTEM. This value is consistent with those reported by Matsubara
