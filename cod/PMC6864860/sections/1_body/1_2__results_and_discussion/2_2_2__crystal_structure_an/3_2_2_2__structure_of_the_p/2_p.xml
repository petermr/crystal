<p>A PROG-DHB crystal specimen was easily obtained by employing a method similar to the one used for PROG-CNA, with a solution of MeOH/water/ammonia (2:2:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) instead of EtOH/water (1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) used in this case. X-ray diffraction analysis of PROG-DHB clearly confirmed a 1:1 molecular stoichiometry of PROG and DHB in the single crystal structure. The refinement of the PROG-DHB structure converged at an acceptable final residual factor

 <sub>1</sub> = 0.0502. This experiment shows that PROG-DHB adopts the same
