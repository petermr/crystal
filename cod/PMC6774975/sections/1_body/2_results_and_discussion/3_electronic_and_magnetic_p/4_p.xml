<p>To further elucidate the magnetic variation under different atomic orderings, we calculated the electronic spin density distribution of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in the (110) plane at the equilibrium lattice, and the results are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F4">figure 4</xref>. This electronic spin density is defined as the electronic density difference between the spin-up and spin-down directions and, thus, it can give information about the magnetic origination and distribution. Note that the same colourmap scale is applied for different structures so as to provide a better visual comparison. We can immediately see the bright colour around Fe atoms in all different structures, and this implies that Fe atoms have large spin density difference and strong magnetism. This can be simply understood because Fe atom often shows ferromagnetic properties in most Fe-based compounds. The spin density difference is smaller around Ni atoms and becomes even indistinguishable with background for Si atoms. For Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure, the colour around Fe atoms from two positions are all the same, leading to the same magnetic moments as shown in 
 <xref rid="RSOS191007TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. This is because the two Fe atoms Fe1 and Fe2 from two sites have the same surrounding environment with four Ni atoms and four Si atoms as the nearest neighbours forming two tetrahedrons and six Fe atoms as the second nearest neighbours forming one octahedron. While, for the XA structure of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi, the Fe atoms from two sites have different environments so they have different spin density distribution, as shown by a brighter colour and larger area around Fe2 than Fe1. Similar effects can also be found in Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi with two Ni atoms of same environments and same magnetic moments under L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure yet different magnetic moments in XA structure. In order to investigate the atom site ordering and its impact on magnetic moments, we focus our inspection mainly on the Fe atoms. First, we compare the spin density distribution of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in XA structure and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure with only one atom in A site changed from Fe to Ni. From 
 <xref rid="RSOS191007TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, we can see the magnetic moments of Fe atoms at B sites in these two compounds have very similar values, inferring that Ni atom as the nearest neighbour of Fe atom almost does not affect its magnetic moment when there is no Si atom present in the nearest neighbours of Fe atom. We suspect that the small difference could be introduced by the slightly different lattice constants. We compare the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in XA structure with only one atom in A site changed from Fe to Ni. The two Fe atoms in C sites both have much smaller magnetic moments than that of the two Fe atoms at B sites in the former two structures, which is probably caused by the different atomic configuration as Si atom is present in the nearest neighbours of Fe atom here and it suppresses the magnetism of Fe atom. Besides, the magnetic moments of Fe atoms, in this case, have larger difference and this could be still from the much bigger lattice difference. In combination, we found that Fe atom has much smaller magnetic moment when Si atom is present in its nearest neighbours and vice versa in both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi.
