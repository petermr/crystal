<p>The crystalline structures of the synthesized nanoparticles were detected using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, DX-2700, China). The Raman spectra were determined using MultiRAM Raman spectroscopy (Bruker Corporation, Raman, Italy). The chemical states of the samples were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi, USA). The morphology, microstructure and particle size of the synthesized nanoparticles were measured using an SEM (HITACHI S4800, Tokyo, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM, FEI Titan G2 60-300, USA) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The optical absorption ranges of the samples were ascertained using UV-vis diffused reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS, Agilent cary 5000, USA).</p>
