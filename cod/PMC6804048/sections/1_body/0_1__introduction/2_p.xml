<p>New alloys based on refractory metal intermetallic compounds can offer a balance of mechanical and environmental properties [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Niobium silicide-based alloys can offer an attractive balance of properties that include oxidation resistance, ballistic resistance, creep, ambient temperature fracture toughness and low and high temperature strength with low density [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their microstructures consist of Nb solid solution and silicide(s) and other intermetallic(s) [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The volume fraction of the solid solution critically depends on alloy chemistry and the distribution of phases is dependent on the macrosegregation of Si and other elements. Macrosegregation of solutes can be significant in the cast alloys and depends on alloy chemistry and processing method [
