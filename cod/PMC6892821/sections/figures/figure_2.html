 <caption> Band structures of Cs 3Sb ( a), Cs 2KSb ( b), and CsK 2Sb ( c). Results from DFT calculations are indicated by black lines while band structures including the quasi-particle correction as computed from G 0 W 0 are represented by red circles. The Fermi energy ( E F ) is set to zero at the VBM. </caption>
