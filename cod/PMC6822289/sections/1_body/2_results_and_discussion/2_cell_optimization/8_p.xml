<p>We can see that in many cases the DFT optimization leads to lower density, corresponding to a shrinking of the unit cell of the COF. The most evident case is for COF 18120N3 (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>), where the density increases from 0.49 to 1.13 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>, with a correspondent decrease of the geometric void fraction from 0.72 to 0.39. After the optimization, this structure becomes nonporous (i.e., null N
 <sub>2</sub>-accessible pore volume and surface). By inspecting the change in the atomic positions and the unit cell lengths we can notice that the structure shrunk to reach a more favorable configuration that optimizes the conformation of the ligands and their van der Waals interactions. For this COF, the measured pore volume from the nitrogen uptake is 0.36 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/g,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
 </sup> i.e., well below the value computed from the reported structure (accessible N
 <sub>2</sub> probe occupiable volume equal to 0.96 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/g). We can therefore expect that this structure can shrink after desolvation. For this COF the rigid crystal assumption would not hold to model the adsorption: the reported structure would lead to artificial results.
