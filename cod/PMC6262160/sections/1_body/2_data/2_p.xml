<p id="p0030">Al_disl.tgz is an archive with atomic positions. 1 × 512 × 128 and 1 × 1024 × 512 refer to the corresponding size of the simulations volume. The Al_edge_1 × 1024 × 512 directory contains gzipped files with the atomic coordinates acquired in the process of purely edge dislocation construction in FCC Al. The Al_mixed_1 × 512 × 128 contains files with the atomic coordinates acquired in the process of mixed dislocation construction in FCC Al. The files are visualizable using OVITO software
