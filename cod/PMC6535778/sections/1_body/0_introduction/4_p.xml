<p>Finally, as a third design rule, the inclusion of magnetic lanthanide elements, if well-placed in the crystal structure, can result in the presence of ordered magnetic states that interact relatively weakly with the other electronic states present, due to the localized nature of 4f electrons.

 </sup> With appropriately selected rare earth elements at the appropriate concentration in the appropriate crystal structure, magnetically ordered states can be found at experimentally accessible temperatures. In materials with unconventional electronic structures, this allows for the interactions between magnetic and topological states to be studied.
