<p id="Par17">Trajectories of CB15-doped droplets were followed in time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The correlation of the pitch P and radius R values with the chirality confinement 
 <italic>N</italic> provides additional evidence that chirality defines the geometry of the helical trajectories. Indeed, the pitch of the helical trajectory increases when the helix gets more confined in the droplet, until it reaches a plateau at 
 <italic>N</italic> ≈ 18. The radius of the helical trajectory increases linearly with 
 <italic>N</italic>, which suggests that increasing the chiral character of the drop increases the angular velocity of the droplet.
