<p id="Par5">Here we present, in contrast to spurrite counterpart, the formation of a novel silicate-carbonate phase after compressing tilleyite above 8 GPa. The high-pressure polymorph is characterized 
 <italic>in situ</italic> by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. DFT calculations confirm that the new phase is thermodynamically more stable at these conditions. We also found evidence for a second dense silicate-carbonate polymorph above 21 GPa. The initial tilleyite structure is recovered after pressure is quenched.
