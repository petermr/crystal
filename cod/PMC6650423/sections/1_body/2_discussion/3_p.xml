<p id="Par14">The super-linear temperature behaviour of the nematicity in YBCO and Hg1201 suggests that the pseudogap transition may not belong to the two- or three-dimensional Ising universality class. One possible explanation is that the nematicity may not be a primary order parameter, whereas another possibility is that pseudogap phenomena are associated with physics beyond the Landau paradigm.</p>
