<p>The measurement of NIR spectra was performed on a Büchi NIR Flex N-500 FT-NIR benchtop spectrometer that was controlled by the manufacturer’s NIRWare 1.4.3010 software (BUCHI
 <sup>®</sup> AG, Flawil, Switzerland). The spectrometer was equipped with Büchi accessory for solid samples and operated in diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) mode and at room temperature (~298 K). The following recording parameters were selected; spectral resolution, spectral range, and scan number were 8 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (resulting in the interpolated 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> of data spacing and 2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> of absolute accuracy), 10,000–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 64, respectively. Sample preparation and spectra recording procedures were triplicated for each sample.
