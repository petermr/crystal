<p>Simple liquids are usually characterized by the short-range positional and orientational order with a typical correlation length of the order of few interparticle distances. Thus, in an X-ray diffraction experiment all orientations of bonds within the illuminated area are averaged, and the 2D diffraction pattern consists of a broad and uniform scattering ring as shown in
