<p>Our results provide evidence that periodic twins with periods up to about 35 nm cannot be regarded as, for example, wurtzite inclusions in a zinc-blende structure and rather confer the crystal with a new symmetry resulting in new properties. On the other hand, we suggest that the model with weighted crystal phase contribution can be a useful tool to predict phononic properties with randomly occurring twins and/or crystal phase mixing where coherent phonon effects do not occur.</p>
