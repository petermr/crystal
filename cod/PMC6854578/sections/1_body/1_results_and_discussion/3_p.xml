<p>The first peak of the density distribution for both Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup> does not locate at the epitaxial lattice position (marked as the vertical dash line in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We find that the shift of the first peak is closely related to the local environment of ions, i.e., the coordination number of water molecules or counter ions around an ion. From

 </xref>a,b, one can see that for both Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, the less water molecules in the first hydration shell (FHS) are, the closer to the epitaxial lattice position is. If a Cl
 <sup>–</sup> is coordinated with more water molecules, it will be further away from the crystal surface. By contrast, a Na
 <sup>+</sup> will be closer to the crystal surface if it is coordinated with more water molecules. The results can be roughly understood as follows: the distribution of ions in the first layer is mainly determined by two factors: (1) maintaining the ionic hydration shell and (2) driving ions to the ideal lattice position. Because of the mismatch between hydrate shell of ions and lattice structure, the former makes ions deviate from the ideal lattice, while the latter drives ions back to the ideal lattice. Therefore, with the decrease of

 <sub>w</sub>, the ions will approach to the ideal lattice position gradually. In principle, the structure of interface is the result of competition between the energy and entropy. Our results show that the energy seems to be superior to entropy at the interface, indicated by the increased ordering tendency of both ions and water molecules.
