 <caption>
  <p>a) Schematic representation of the crystal structure of SSZ‐27 with the heart‐shaped cavities (50T) in green, and the 42T cavities in blue. Each 42T cavity connects four heart‐shaped cavities through 8‐ring windows, forming one‐dimensional channels along the 
   <italic>y</italic>‐axis. Red lines indicate the direction of a pair of 8‐ring straight channels. The 8‐ring channels are linked through the 42T cavities. The heart‐shaped cavities can be viewed as large side pockets. Views of the framework structure along the b) 
   <italic>x</italic>‐ and c) 
   <italic>z</italic>‐axes showing the ADPs at 50 % probability. Red Si, blue O.
