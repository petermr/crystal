<p id="Par18">Typical 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs are composed of portions of 2–3 〈111〉-PNRs, which are arranged so that the adjacent regions are preferentially 71° 〈111〉 variants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d;</xref> Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). This preference, which also agrees with the MD simulations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, is evident both from the analysis of the individual 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs and from the histograms that describe distributions of distances between the Pb atoms that belong to the 71°, 109°, and 180° variants, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Thus, PMN exhibits a hierarchical PNR structure, with the correlated arrangement of the 〈111〉-PNRs yielding the aggregate 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs; this aggregate nature of 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs is retained even if the threshold value of 
 <italic>α</italic> used to identify them is reduced. No relation could be found between the PNRs and the significantly smaller CORs; the size difference between these two types of regions becomes particularly pronounced at 200 K.
