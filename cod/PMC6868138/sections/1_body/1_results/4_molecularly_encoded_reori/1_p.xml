<p id="Par19">Under illumination, the operation of the molecular motors inverts the cholesteric helix in the droplets and induces the same absolute values of pitch. Remarkably, when the handedness of the spiral is forced to invert rapidly, by strong irradiation with light (ca. 1 s for the overall inversion), the droplets reorient significantly in three-dimensional space and the handedness of their trajectories inverts also (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). We note that helix inversion occurs in one second and moreover, the final pitch is equal to the initial pitch, therefore the confinement ration 
 <italic>N</italic> does not vary considerably within the timescale of the inversion. Specifically, and considering the time evolution of N (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), we estimate that 
 <italic>N</italic> increases of only 0.03 units in one second. This association between photo-induced reorientation and dynamic helix inversion is reminiscent of the ‘helical klinotaxis’ that is responsible for the complex photo-tactic behavior of 
 <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. This unicellular green alga swims along helical trajectories and, in response to light, it inverts the handedness of its helical motion, which makes it swim towards the light. As a protective mechanism, when the light is too intense, 
 <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> inverts the handedness of its helical trajectory again in order to swim away from the light
