<p>We measured isothermal magnetization at 2 and 300 K for both the directions described above. At 2 K, which is below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>SR</sub>, the magnetization along [001] saturates at 0.3 T, and the saturation magnetization is 4.7 μ
 <sub>B</sub>/f.u, while along [100], the saturation is rather slow and is achieved at 3 T. Thus, below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>SR</sub>, the easy axis is [001]. This magnetic behavior indicates the large magnetic anisotropy present in the compound, while the negligible coercivity shows that the compound is a soft magnet. At 300 K, which is above 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>SR</sub>, [001] is still an easy axis, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>d. Unlike at 2 K, the magnetization along both [001] and [100] varies rather linearly with the magnetic field below the saturation at 300 K. We have measured the electrical resistivity of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn as a function of temperature (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>d) while passing the current along [100]. The resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature, which indicates that the compound is metallic in nature. The slope changes at 392 and 170 K correspond to 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> and 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>SR</sub>, respectively, which are consistent with the magnetization measurements. The values of resistivity at 300 and 2 K are 0.15 and 0.046 mΩ cm, respectively.
