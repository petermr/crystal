<p>Freshly cleaved samples were electronically connected by gold wires (50 Î¼m in diameter) using silver paste (Dupont 4929N) before being mounted onto a rotary probe equipped with a Hall sensor and loaded into a temperature-variable cryostat inside a superconducting or Bitter magnet for low- and high-field measurements, respectively. A Keithley 6221 current source was used to generate an ac current excitation along the chosen axis, and a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research 830) was used for the voltage measurement.</p>
