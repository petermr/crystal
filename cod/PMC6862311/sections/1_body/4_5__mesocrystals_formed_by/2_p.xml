<p>In contrast to colloidal crystals consisting of spherical particles, which were discussed in the previous section, the nanoparticles here are faceted single crystals, and therefore exhibit significant anisotropy [

 <xref rid="B102-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Facet-specific interaction between organic ligands and inorganic nanoparticles can lead to a well-defined orientation of the nanoparticles with respect to the mesocrystalline superlattice [

 <xref rid="B105-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Thus, a comprehensive structural study of mesocrystals addresses not only the structure of the superlattice, but also the orientation of the nanoparticles with respect to the superlattice. AXCCA appears to be especially suited for such studies since it naturally allows to investigate mutual angular correlations between the mesocrystal superlattice and the atomic lattice of the nanoparticles by means of the CCF
