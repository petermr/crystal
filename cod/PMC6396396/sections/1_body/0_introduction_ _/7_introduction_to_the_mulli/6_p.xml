<p>In the range 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.5 there are 30 cases with 
 <italic>L</italic> ≤ 20. As the number of atoms, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>A</sub>, in each supercell amounts to 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>A</sub> = 2
 <italic>L</italic>(16 − 
 <italic>x</italic>) the selected composition range can be studied efficiently with relatively small supercells, which is advantageous for the computational time. Irrational values of 
 <italic>x</italic> correspond to incommensurately modulated structures and were not considered for this study.
