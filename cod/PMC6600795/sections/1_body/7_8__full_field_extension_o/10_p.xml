 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f014">Figure 14</xref>b shows the stress field of the normal stresses σ
 <sub>xx,</sub> corresponding to aluminum, the material of the example for a Volterra’s type of dislocation [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is interesting to observe that the distribution of stress levels for the Volterra’s type of dislocation is similar to the strain levels of the directional derivatives shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f013">Figure 13</xref>. One has in the neighborhood of the dislocation a half-plane that is compressed and the other half plane that is in tension. One solution corresponds to the Eulerian description and the deformations cannot be considered belonging to the region of small rotations and deformations. The other solution corresponds to the Lagrangian representation for infinitesimal deformation. Equilibrium conditions and geometry define displacement fields. Interestingly, application of Cauchy-Born rule as a homogenization technique gives a displacement field whose derivatives indicate the presence of a dislocation, thus merging with the theory of elasticity modeling of an edge dislocation.
