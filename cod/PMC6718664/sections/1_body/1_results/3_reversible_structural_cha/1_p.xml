<p id="Par7">Inspired by the reversible structural change and the improved electrochemical performances, we investigated the reaction mechanism during Na ion insertion/extraction in partially dehydrated Na-bir (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, the normalized Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra shift towards higher energies during Na ion extraction and move back to the original position during Na ion insertion. The edge positions of Mn K-edge XANES spectra after first charge and discharge are identical with those after second charge and discharge, respectively, implying that the redox process is extremely reversible. It has been reported that the

 <sup>3</sup>-weighted EXAFS spectra can identify the characteristic connectivity of MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra composed of edge-sharing di-μ-oxo bridging between Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions, corner-sharing mono-μ-oxo bridging between Mn
 <sup>3+/4+</sup> ions, and combination of both in various MnO

 </sub> compounds. In Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), spectral similarity between the investigated compound and the reference compounds is indicative of identical local structure

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, this technique is suitable for substantiating our aforementioned structural model that eliminating crystal water from the interlayer is accompanied by the migration of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> ions into the interlayer vacancy, leading to a spinel-like phase with edge-sharing and corner-sharing MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. Compared with the previously reported Mn K-edge EXAFS spectra for MnO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> compounds, the spectra for the partially dehydrated Na-bir in pristine and desodiated states clearly indicate both edge and corner-sharing MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra with triple-hump peak in 3–6 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). After Na ion was inserted back into the structure, the EXAFS oscillations are indicative of its structure transformation into a layered phase with edge-sharing MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. In the 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sup>3</sup>-weighted EXAFS spectra at different states of charge and discharge, the distinguishable EXAFS oscillations change reversibly between a double-hump and a triple-hump peak in the 3–6 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> range during electrochemical cycling, which means reversible structural changes between layered and spinel-like phases during sodiation/desodiation (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). In this context, the theoretical calculation represents the reduced electronic configuration toward Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> valence state at the tetrahedral site (migrated state) comparing to the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> valence state at the octahedral site (original state) in the projected (partial) density of states (PDOS) of Mn
