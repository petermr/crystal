 </inline-formula> is plotted for three different settings in Fig. 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>. In the backscattering detectors a resolution of 1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (obtained from FWHM calculations using 
 <italic>GSAS-II</italic>) can be achieved, and even at low angles a very good resolution of 2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> is maintained. Some of the resolution can be traded off for intensity by using the high-intensity guide setting. At center wavelengths of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.665 Å, one can expect intensity gains of 1.2, 1.8 and 2.2, respectively, from the high-resolution to high-intensity settings.
