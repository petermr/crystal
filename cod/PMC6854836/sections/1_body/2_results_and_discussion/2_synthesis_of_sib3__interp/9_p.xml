<p>According to Aselage, the reaction of silicon and boron (to yield α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>) proceeds by the following sequence. First, boron diffuses into silicon, ultimately reaching saturation. (Note that boron diffuses rapidly in Si,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>
 </sup> but the solubility of B in Si is very low, 0.2% at 1000 °C.

 </sup>) Second, under conditions of boron supersaturation, α-SiB

 </sub> nucleates and begins to grow. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that the particle size of Si has a large effect on the reaction rate.

 </xref>b shows a micron-Si/B = 1:4 pellet after sintering at 1200 °C for 24 h. In the former sample, nano-Si appears to be agglomerated to larger, 0.1–1 μm, particles and amorphous boron partially crystallized to SiB

 </xref>). α-SiB

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b), is seen as rather irregular (“wormlike”) particles with sizes around 1 μm. The SEM image of the latter sample shows clearly Si particles with their original size (1–5 μm) and shape and possessing a boron-enriched rim. This rim may be envisioned to develop and host α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> nuclei, which subsequently grow to wormlike crystallites. Upon growth, α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystallites detach from the surface of a Si particle, which eventually gets consumed.
