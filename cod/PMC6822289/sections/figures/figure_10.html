 <caption> Comparison of simulated (lines) CO 2 isotherms with experimental ones (triangles). 36 The isotherms were obtained at 300 and 298 K, respectively. Note that the simulated uptake of COF 05000N2 is set to zero because, from geometric analysis, no accessible volume was found for CO 2 nor N 2. The conventional names of these COFs are, in the same order as in the legend, COF-1, COF-5, COF-10, COF-6, COF-8, COF-102, and COF-103. </caption>
