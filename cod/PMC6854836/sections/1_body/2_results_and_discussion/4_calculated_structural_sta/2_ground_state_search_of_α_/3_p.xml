<p>The final expansion included 1019 σ and employed a total of 70 ECIs. That is, apart from the 0-site and 1-site interactions, the ECIs are composed of 39 two-site interactions and 29 three-site interactions. The final ECIs fit the 1019 input σ with a cross-validation error of 4.817 meV/site (see

 <sub>2.5</sub>, SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, and SiB
 <sub>3.67</sub> were predicted (see

We note further that DFT-derived and CE-predicted ground-state σ agreed with each other and that no other ground-state σ within 42 atoms/primitive supercell was predicted, thus confirming the predictive power of the final ECIs.
