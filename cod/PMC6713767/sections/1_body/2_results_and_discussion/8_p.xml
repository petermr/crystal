<p id="Par28">As a proof of lighting application, the green-emitting zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor is encapsulated on a UV-emitting chip to fabricate green LED. The EL emission spectrum at 3 V voltage is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. It can be found that the emission peaks of the UV-emitting chip and the green-emitting phosphor are located at ~ 375 nm and ~ 523 nm, respectively. And the inset is the photograph of working green LED that emits bright green light at 3 V voltage. The color coordinates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b) is calculated to be (0.295, 0.537) for the resulting green LED, indicating superior green color purity.
