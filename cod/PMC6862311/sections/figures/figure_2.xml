 <caption>
  <p>Schematic representation of different LC phases. (
   <bold>a</bold>) The nematic phase, in which elongated molecules are preferably aligned along the director 
   <bold>n</bold>; (
   <bold>b</bold>) The smectic-A phase, in which elongated molecules form parallel layers in addition to the nematic orientational order; (
   <bold>c</bold>) The columnar phase, in which aligned disc-like molecules form 2D lattice of columns.
