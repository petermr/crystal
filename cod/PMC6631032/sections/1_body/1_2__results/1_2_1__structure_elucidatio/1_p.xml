<p>9-Chlorolumichrome (
 <bold>1</bold>) was isolated as a yellowish solid material, which presented high-resolution (HR) negative ESI-MS mass signals ([M−H]
 <sup>−</sup>) at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 275.0356 and 277.0341 in a 3:1 ion intensity ratio, corresponding to the molecular formula C
 <sub>12</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>Cl and 10 degrees of unsaturation. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) of 
 <bold>1</bold> resembled that of lumichrome [
 <xref rid="B7-metabolites-09-00110" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] except for the absence of one singlet aromatic proton and small differences in the chemical shifts of its other proton signals when compared with those of lumichrome [
 <xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00110" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) of 
 <bold>1</bold>, small changes in the chemical shifts of the carbons relative to those of lumichrome and an additional quaternary sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbon instead of one of the sp
 <sup>2</sup> methine carbons of lumichrome were observed. The latter data suggest that one of the aromatic methines (C-6 or C-9) of lumichrome was substituted by a chlorine atom. Analysis of the 2D NMR spectra of 
 <bold>1</bold> and comparison of the chemical shifts of C-2, C-4 and C-10a with those of lumichrome established 
 <bold>1</bold> as 9-chlorolumichrome. The chlorination of lumichrome with 
 <italic>N</italic>-chlorosuccinimide using the procedure of Tanemura et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-metabolites-09-00110" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] afforded a single product which presented NMR and MS data identical with those of 
 <bold>1</bold>. X-ray analysis of a crystal obtained from the synthetic material confirmed its structure as 9-chlorolumichrome (
