 </xref> presents photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) before and after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping. The excitation spectra of the three phosphors are somewhat different in shape, probably because of the distinct crystal system of host lattices: tetragonal for Li
 <sub>2</sub>CaSiO
 <sub>4</sub>, trigonal for Li
 <sub>2</sub>SrSiO
 <sub>4</sub>, and hexagonal for Li
 <sub>2</sub>BaSiO
 <sub>4</sub>. For Ca and Sr, the emission intensities are increased after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, by factors of 1.8 and 1.5, respectively. For Ba, there is no considerable increase even after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping. The emission spectra exhibit broad bands with band maxima between 450 and 650 nm: 480 nm for Ca, 569 nm for Sr, and 509 nm for Ba. The 4f–5d transition energy of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is greatly dependent on the local environment because the local structure around Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-activator ion has a great influence on the centroid shift energy (CS) and crystal field splitting (CFS) of the 5d levels as well as the Stokes shift (Δ
 <italic>S</italic>) of the emission. Among the factors determining the 4f–5d transition energy of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, the center of gravity (barycenter) of the 5d levels is lowered relative to the free Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in the vacuum state, mainly ascribed to the covalent bonding character between Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and coordinating anions (O
 <sup>2–</sup>). Separately from a centroid shift, the neighboring anions have an additional influence on the 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup> energy level of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, known as crystal field splitting (CFS). The magnitude of the CFS is dependent on the geometrical interaction between 5d orbitals and anion ligands: the energy of the 5d electron is raised because of the larger repulsion between the 5d electron in an orbital oriented toward an anion ligand and the electrons in the neighboring ligands, whereas that of the 5d electron in an orbital oriented away from an anion ligand is lowered. It should be mentioned that Pauling’s rule 3 based on the hard-spheres electrostatic model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 </sup> states that the sharing of edge and face by two polyhedrons decreases the stability of an ionic structure because of the increase in cation–cation repulsions as the cations get close together. For a certain coordination geometry, the degree of cation–cation repulsions also increases in the following order: corner-shared &lt; edge-shared &lt; face-shared. Thus, Pauling’s rule 3 means that most ionic solids will prefer to be corner-shared rather than edge- or face-shared because of the bond stability. Notably, Morrison verified that the shift of the central energy of 4f
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>–1
 </sup>5d configurations (for activator ion) is directly proportional to the summation of ligand polarizabilities over all nearest coordinating anion ligands.
