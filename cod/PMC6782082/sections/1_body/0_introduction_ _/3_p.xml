<p>While space groups and their representations describe the symmetry of the bulk electron and phonon states, the layer groups are essential for the description of the electronic structure and the surface states of crystals. Depending on the interaction between the layer and the bulk, materials with layer symmetry can be classified into five different types: (i) pure layered systems like free-standing films, with graphene monolayers as a notable example of such films; (ii) single layers in layered crystals which, owing to a weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, can be separated from the bulk; (iii) artificial nanolayers grown on substrates or between two bulk materials where the interaction between the nanolayer and surrounding bulk materials is neglected; (iv) layers (or slabs) which model atomically clean crystal surfaces where the slab interaction with the rest of the semi-infinite crystal is neglected; (v) interfaces between different crystals, including domain walls approximated by atomically clean crystal surfaces.</p>
