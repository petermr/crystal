<p>The full-field acquisition scheme of a time-of-flight 
 <italic>k</italic>-microscope is ideal for rapid recording of XPD patterns without changing the sample geometry. However, the angular range is much smaller than in conventional experiments. A sequence of photoelectron diffraction patterns for the Re 4

 <italic>h</italic>ν = 2.8 and 6 keV is shown in Fig. 8

 <italic>k</italic>-images correspond to angular ranges between 0–15° at 2.770 keV and 0–11° at 5.970 keV. Some fine features have widths &lt;0.1 Å
