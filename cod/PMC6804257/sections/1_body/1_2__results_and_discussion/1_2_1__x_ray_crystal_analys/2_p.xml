<p>The ligand molecule was described by quasi-C
 <sub>2</sub> symmetry about the axis through the C4–C5 and C9–C10 bonds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In the carboxylate groups, the C12–O4 and C14–O6 bonds were longer than the C12–O3 and C14–O5 bonds. Each molecule had a zwitterion structure, in which protonated atoms form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the non-protonated atoms of the neighboring molecule with N4-H4∙∙∙O6′ and N1′-H1′∙∙∙O4 to construct a trimeric aggregate, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figure S2 and Table S7</xref>. Protonated and deprotonated N-acetate groups were present in the H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 receptor, supporting the proton population of 0.5 at each donor atom. The formation of a similar zwitterion structure was confirmed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR in solution (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figure S3</xref>). Around pD 9, protons b, d, and e adjacent to the amino nitrogen underwent a large shift to higher δ values with decreasing pD, indicating that the first protonation equilibrium occurred at the amino nitrogen. With a further decrease of pD below ~5, proton d showed a second shift due to the protonation at the carboxylate oxygen.
