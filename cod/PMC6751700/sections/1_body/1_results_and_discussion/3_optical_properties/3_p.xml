 </xref>. The PL peak energy decreased with increasing 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> due to the decrease in the band gap. The chromaticity coordinates converted from the PL spectra changed from (0.058, 0.656) to (0.680, 0.258) by tuning the contents of Br and I, as shown in

 <sub>n</sub> = 0.33 was closest to the coordinates (0.170, 0.797) of the green vertex of the BT.2020 standard. To realize the ideal emission color at the green vertex, a narrower PL peak is required to improve the green color purity. As shown in

 </xref>, the FWHM of the PL peak reached its maximum at 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> = 0.48, while it decreased as the halide composition became closer to containing only bromide or iodide. The increase in the FWHM could be explained by the widening of the particle size distribution and the compositional inhomogeneity of Br
 <sup>–</sup> and I
 <sup>–</sup> between the individual NCs. Swarnkar et al. synthesized CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs that were 11 nm in size by the hot-injection method and found that there was no significant difference between the PL peak widths from their ensemble and single nanocrystals.

 </sup> In this work, the NCs prepared by the hot-injection method included particles larger than 10 nm, from TEM observation (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01858/suppl_file/ao9b01858_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S2</ext-link>), while the exciton Bohr diameters of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> and CsPbI
 <sub>3</sub> are 7 and 12 nm,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 </sup> respectively. In a typical hot-injection method for perovskite CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> NCs, most of the formed NCs are &gt;10 nm in size due to their rapid growth rate.

 </sup> The quantum size effect in the prepared NCs should not be strong; therefore, the influence of the inhomogeneity of the particle sizes on the FWHM of the PL peak should be negligible. The FWHM decreased as the halide composition approached that of a monohalide bromide or iodide, whereas broadening of the PL peak was observed as 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> approached 0.5. This might be due to compositional inhomogeneity between individual NCs. According to the elemental analysis of randomly selected single NCs by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), local I/(Br + I) compositions of 0.20 and 0.46 were detected for NCs prepared at 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>n</sub> = 0.50 (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01858/suppl_file/ao9b01858_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S5 and Table S2</ext-link>). Thus, there was compositional inhomogeneity between individual NCs, causing an increase in the PL peak width. The increase in FWHM is possibly caused by the photoinduced phase segregation, which is known for mixed-halide lead perovskites.
