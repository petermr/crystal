<p>Note here, that the binding diagrams are calculated with the assumption that the molecular conformation (in our case, almost planar geometry of the star after its optimization [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) does not alter upon dimerization, translation or rotation. On the contrary, the formation of hydrogen bonds requires not only the rotation of the stars but also the alteration of the planarity of the BTA cores. More realistic binding models will be considered further when we will discuss the mechanisms of self-assembly of azoâ€“BTA stars in aqueous solution.
