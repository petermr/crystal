<p>Unlike zabuyelite, Na and K-carbonates have high solubility, which for K-carbonate increases with elevated temperature.

 </sup> The absence of these minerals in the precipitated phases is consistent with the expected higher thermodynamic stability of zabuyelite with respect to these phase.

 </sup> As Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> will not compete directly for carbonate via the growth of additional solid phases, the main influence of these ions will be on the chemistry of the system. For example, Na-carbonate ion pairs were predicted based on the PHREEQC simulations. Incorporation of the mineral constituent ion into an ion pair with a nonconstituent ion can significantly lower the supersaturation of the solution with respect to the mineral of interest.

 </sup> Indeed, the time required for nucleation doubled in the presence of 1 M NaCl in comparison to the additive free experiments. However, the formation of rosettes with hollow cores indicates that the supersaturation remained high despite the formation of Na-carbonate ion pairs.
