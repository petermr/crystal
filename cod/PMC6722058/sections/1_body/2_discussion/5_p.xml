<p id="Par30">Unguided stochastic process starts to dictate the generation of the model structures for larger systems so that ever larger number of model structures have to be generated in order to have a complete representation of all relevant overall conformations. A further advantage of our method is that the process can be made guided by weighting the good choices made in model structure generation. In this study we introduced one possible approach for optimizing the global structural search. The main idea is to repeat the predictions by taking for the next run the possible interface atom positions from the set of best model structures of the previous run. Other possibilities would be to weight the interface atom positions on-the-fly based on the success of the model structure generation.</p>
