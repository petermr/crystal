<p>The conventional LCD structure is characterized by an overall optical efficiency of around 3–5% (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref>b), and the light loss across the color filters and polarizers is more than 70%. Field sequential color displays were introduced to manage the losses of color filters, but finding solutions to increase the polarization efficiency of modern LCD still imposes a challenge.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> The backlight equipped with polarized light emitters as a color conversion layer may increase the polarization efficiency of the polarizer films from 45% to 70%, and therefore, the overall efficiency of the conventional LCD may increase from 3–5% to 6–8% (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref>b).
