<p>Electron localization function (ELF) also provides important information about the bonding interaction between the constituents of a compound. It can be seen from

 </xref>c that the ELF is maximum at O sites and minimum at Pb and V sites for both the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases. Finite ELF can be seen in between V and O in the tetragonal phase showing the presence of finite covalent bonding between them. The presence of the stereochemically active lone pair electrons at Pb site is also clearly visible in the ELF plot for the tetragonal case. So, the bonding interaction between Pb and O as well as between V and O in the ferroelectric tetragonal phase can be concluded as having dominant ionic character with finite covalent bonding. The difference in the bonding behaviors of Ti/V–O and Pb–O bonds for paraelectric and ferroelectric phases plays a crucial role for the large volume contraction during the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. We have also plotted the isosurface of the valence electron localization function with an ELF value of 0.7, which is shown in

 </xref>. This figure shows the lobe like lone pairs of hybridized 6s electrons at the Pb site. The charge density and charge transfer plots show that finite amount of electrons from Pb sites covalently interact with O 2p ensuring that 6s electrons of Pb are not completely chemically inert.
