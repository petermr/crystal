 <caption> For a set of 296 porous and DFT-optimized COFs the CO 2 parasitic energy is plotted versus the Henry coefficient for CO 2. The dotted line gives the comparable parasitic energy of the amine-based capture process. In the lower plots the parasitic energy is plotted versus the other two main outputs from the process modeling: the CO 2 working capacity per cubic meter of adsorbent bed and the final CO 2 molar purity of the mixture. </caption>
