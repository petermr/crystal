 <caption> (a) PL spectra of white light generated by employing the PVP/N-CDot drop-cast films layered over a 450 nm blue LED chip as a function of the N-CDot amount (µL) (pink line: 15 µL, black line: 25 µL, red line: 35 µL and blue line: 50 µL). (b) Calculated CRI, CCT, LER and luminous flux (lumen) values of the related drop-cast films with different amounts of N-CDots. </caption>
