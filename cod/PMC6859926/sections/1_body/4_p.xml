<p>Based on the reported literature, the antitumor actions of LB-100 are most apparent when used in combination with therapies associated with DDR-/genomic stress-induced apoptosis (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> cisplatin, doxorubicin) or SAC-triggering mitotic poisons (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> paclitaxel, vinblastine). These observations support the concept that existing therapies that trigger apoptosis in cancer cells can be augmented by the simultaneous suppression of the many PPPases that act to suppress the onset of apoptosis in the DDR, SAC, and other checkpoint control mechanisms. Here, it is important to consider that suppression, without ablation of activity may be needed to achieve cancer cell selective death, because compounds (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> microcystin) that potently inhibit PPP1C, PP2AC, PPP4C, and PPP5C have marked systemic toxicity. At the concentration used in animal studies that appear achievable in humans based on the early phase I data, LB-100 inhibits both PP2AC and PPP5C. LB100M/endothall lacks selectivity, and if present, is likely suppressing the activity of all cantharidin-sensitive phosphatases (PPP1C, PP2AC, PPP5C, and PPP6C). Regardless of whether the biological effects of LB-100 treatment are the result of suppressing one or several PPP family members, the promising results from these early clinical trials should not be ignored.
