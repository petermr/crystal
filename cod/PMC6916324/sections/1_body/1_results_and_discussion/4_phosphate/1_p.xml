<p>Regarding the nature of the P−O bonds in phosphate, there is still a long‐standing discussion about the presence or absence of double‐bond character, hence also about the presence or absence of valence expansion at the phosphorus atom. Different theoretical calculations led to various binding models. Molina, Sundberg et al.
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> investigated the bonding situation of several theoretically calculated and geometry optimized structures by means of QTAIM. They showed that the P−O bond in phosphane oxide is best described with a highly polar σ‐bond with a considerable electrostatic contribution. The same is valid for iminophosphoranes.

 <sup>3−</sup> to be 7.94 and at the sulfur atom in sulfate to be 4.34. He, among many others, regarded the P−O bond in phosphate as very polar. For potassium sulfate, the high polarity of the S−O bond was already established in an experimental charge‐density investigation.
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> In this study, we also show for phosphate that the bond between phosphorus and oxygen is a highly polar covalent bond with no double‐bond character.
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> The evidence for this stems from the high ED and a positive Laplacian, the trace of the Hessian matrix of the second derivative of the ED function, at the BCP. As expected, for all four P−O bonds a high ED was found at the BCP, which suggests a covalent bond (Table 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The values vary from 1.54 to 1.61 eÅ
 <sup>−3</sup> and are in a good agreement with the theoretical data. For the Laplacian at the BCP, positive values were found in the range of 2–5 eÅ
 <sup>−5</sup>, which are slightly higher than those from theory (0–3 eÅ
 <sup>−5</sup>). Given that the BCP is located in a rampant edge of the Laplace function, even a small variation in the position of the BCP will cause a tremendous change in the numerical value and sometimes even a change of sign (Table
