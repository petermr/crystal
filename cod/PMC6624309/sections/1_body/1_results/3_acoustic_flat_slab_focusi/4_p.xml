 <italic>f</italic> = 5λ as the focal length. For the sake of clarity, there is a rule to convert a continuous phase profile to a discrete phase profile. Because the π phase difference of two structural arrangements, the units providing π phase shift is utilized to displace the continuous phase range π ± π/2 at the specified position in the y direction. From Eq. (

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref>. We arrange the two unit structures to construct the lens according to coordinates, and the absolute acoustic pressure field of reflected waves for the designed lens is plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(c)</xref>. It is clearly observed that an excellent focusing effect occurs at the left space of the constructed lens when the plane wave is vertically incident. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(d)</xref> shows the distribution of the absolute pressure field in the vertical direction, where the coordinate of the x axis is selected as −0.13 
 <italic>m</italic> away from the outer structure. The intensity of the pressure at the focal points is approximately 2.3 times larger than that of the incident waves.
