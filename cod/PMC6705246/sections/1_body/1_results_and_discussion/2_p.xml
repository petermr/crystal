<p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BGT:
 <italic>x</italic>Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.2 mol %) samples are displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>. It could be seen that all of the diffraction peaks of these samples were completely matched with those of the standard JCPDS card of the BGT compound (no. 49-1900). Furthermore, other impurity phases were not found. The experimental results indicated that single-phase BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors were successfully synthesized and doping of the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions into the BGT host had no substantial effect on the BGT structure.
