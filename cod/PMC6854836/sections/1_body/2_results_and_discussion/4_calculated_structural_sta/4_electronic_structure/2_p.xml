 </xref> compares the electronic DOS of the predicted ground-state σ of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> and α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, as well as the DOS of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>. Expectedly, our simulations reveal that α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> is a semiconductor with a completely filled valence band due to the electron-precise nature of Si
 <sub>2</sub>(B
 <sub>10</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup>
 <sub>2</sub>). On the other hand, α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> is a metal. Such a metallic behavior of α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> can be interpreted by the electron deficiency of the B
 <sub>11</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup> icosahedron, requiring an extra electron to completely fill all of its bonding states. As a result, the existence of B
 <sub>11</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup> icosahedra not only gives rise to unoccupied electronic states (holes) in the valence band but also implies that nonstoichiometric α-SiB

 <sub>2</sub> and B

It should, however, be noted that the electron-deficient state of icosahedral boron-rich solids, caused by deviations from their electron-precise compositions, can be compensated by configurational disorder arising either from substitutional and interstitial defects or from vacancies, as recently demonstrated for boron carbides B

Because of their more B-rich composition, the latter are expected to possess a higher carrier concentration.
