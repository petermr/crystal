<p>Crystal data and structure refinement details are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03936-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. All the hydrogen atoms bound to the carbon atoms were positioned in predefined positions which have been previously calculated. These positions were then refined using a riding model with C-H = 0.93–0.99 Å,

 <sub>eq</sub>(C-Methyl). All the active hydrogen atoms (OH and NH) were found in difference Fourier maps. During the final refinement cycles, OHs and NHs were repositioned in the initially calculated geometrical coordinates. These positions were then refined using the same riding model, with O-H = 0.82 Å, N-H = 0.87 Å,
