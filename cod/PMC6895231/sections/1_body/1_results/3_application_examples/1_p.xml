<p id="Par20">In the following, we demonstrate the method with a few examples. As an application in 2D, we present work on a polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) solar cell. The SAROM scanning procedure used for the poly-Si sample is shown in Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>. We generated an orientation map of the poly-Si surface as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> by performing a least square fit to the Euler angles based on data from all nine polarized channels (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>). In order to estimate the quality of the analysis technique, we compared this result with an orientation map of the same sample area using EBSD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). A map of the local orientation difference: the misorientation angle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) exhibited an average orientation difference of ~2.1° (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>). We argue that this error is dominated by a geometrical distortion of grains in the EBSD data (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>). In order to minimize this effect we corrected the EBDS map for distortions and removed grain boundaries. Nevertheless, several artifact are still present on the map (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Other sources of discrepancies may be connected with orientation dependent ambiguity of SAROM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and an orientation determination error of EBSD.
