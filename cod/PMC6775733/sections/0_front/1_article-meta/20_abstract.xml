<abstract abstract-type="toc">
 <p>In the title polymeric complex, the tetra­cyano­platinate anions bridge the Fe
  <sup>II</sup> cations to form infinite two-dimensional layers that propagate along the 
  <italic>bc</italic> plane. Two guest mol­ecules of acetone per Fe
  <sup>II</sup> are located between the layers. These guest acetone mol­ecules inter­act with the coordinated water mol­ecules by O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds.
