<p>In summary, the electronic structure of the silicon‐rich cage compound MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> exhibits distinct differences to typical intermetallic host–guest assemblies despite similar structural features. The calculated electronic density of states of MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> reveals a clear pseudo‐gap around the Fermi level. Chemical bonding is organized in form of conventional two‐center two‐electron bonds within the three‐dimensional silicon framework. In addition, there is evidence for multi‐atom bonding between framework and cage atoms in the large cavities as well as lone‐pair‐like interactions in the smaller empty voids of the framework.
