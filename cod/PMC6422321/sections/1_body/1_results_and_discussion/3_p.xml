<p>To attain efficient and tunable white-light-emitting phosphor coatings, the most efficient GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor film was employed as the red-emitting sublayer and the Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>-doped GdVO
 <sub>4</sub> as the green sublayer. As depicted by the black solid line in

 </xref>a, GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor features narrow emission lines in the blue (483 nm) and yellow (572 nm) regions of the visible spectrum. By comparing the excitation spectra of GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> shown by the dashed lines in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>a, one can notice that they are almost identical, which demonstrates the occurrence of energy transfer from the host to Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. Layered phosphor coatings were fabricated by sequential spin coating of nanophosphors. To improve the adhesion to the substrate (quartz), the phosphor bilayer is deposited over a thin layer of ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>. We observed that such a layer improves the uniformity of the nanophosphor films deposited atop, which may originate from the different surface charge of the ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> film compared to the quartz substrate. To achieve white-light emission, stacks with a total thickness of ∼500 nm were prepared, so that full extinction of the photoexcitation was guaranteed as it would be required if these coatings are integrated as downshifters in light-emitting devices. Indeed, our measurements indicate that the PL intensity increases with the thickness of the films up to ∼350 nm, meaning that such value of film thickness is enough so as to absorb the complete fraction of the excitation light that is not reflected in the nanophosphor/air interface.

 </sup> Eventually, layered coatings were sintered at 800 °C. Thermal annealing gives rise to porous but continuous films in which structural defects and surface traps present in the as-prepared nanocrystals are reduced.

 </xref>b. As the crystalline matrix hosting the two types of cations employed is the same, each layer in the stack responds equally to the thermal treatment, making the interface between the two types of RE-doped layers indistinguishable.
