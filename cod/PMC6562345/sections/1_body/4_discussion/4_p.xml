<p>This is consistent with our observations of these structures' flexibility more generally. As previously noted, the rhombohedral structure is distorted along the pseudocubic body diagonal (i.e. the hexagonal 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20180227F1">figure 1</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>), which is perpendicular to all guanidinium ions, and is therefore relatively flexible along this direction. On the other hand, the herringbone arrangement of guanidinium ions makes the orthorhombic structure more rigid. Thus the rhombohedral structure is able to accommodate favourable hydrogen-bonding distances in both 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CdGF</bold>; by contrast, the more rigid orthorhombic structure is unable to distort in this way.
