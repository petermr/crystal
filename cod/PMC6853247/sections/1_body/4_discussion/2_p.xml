<p>This study describes a microstructural characterization with the TEM of a sample of San Carlos olivine partially transformed to wadsleyite at high‐pressure (14 GPa) and temperature (1400 °C). At the SEM scale, the transformation into wadsleyite (in the form of irregular domains at grain boundaries or inside grains) was readily observed. However, some lamellae with morphologies clearly distinct from the wadsleyite domains were also present. At the TEM scale, we have used the recently developed (Rauch et al.,

In this technique, a collection of electron diffraction spot patterns is acquired, while an area of interest of the sample is scanned by the electron beam. The recorded electron diffraction spot patterns are compared with templates calculated for all possible orientations of the phases expected to be present in the area of interest. We have calculated templates corresponding to olivine, wadsleyite, and ringwoodite using crystallographic data from Birle et al. (
