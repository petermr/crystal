<p>During the preparation of this review, the compilation of alanates beyond the group 1 and 2 was a good surprise. Many of them have a reasonable good dehydrogenation temperature and hydrogen content. Others can be viewed just as a chemical curiosity. In general, the reports of the alanates of transition metals and main group are very old. Perhaps, re-visiting and updating the information of these alanates with new synthesis and characterization techniques could provide new approaches for solving the hydrogen storage problem. </p>
