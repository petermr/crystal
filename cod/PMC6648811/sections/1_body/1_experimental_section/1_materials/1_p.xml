<p>The NaYF4:Yb/Tm/Nd/Gd (30/0.5/1/20 mol %)@NaGdF4:Nd (20 mol %) coreâ€“shell UCNPs (Nd-UCNPs) used in these studies were provided by Dr. E. M. Chan and E. S. Levy at the Molecular Foundry of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The biocompatible silicone polymers used included NuSil Technology LLC formulations MED-4805, MED4-4220, MED-6019, MED-6215, MED-6233, and MED-6755.
