<p>We also found cases of the “solvent-assisted” proton transfer schematically indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d–e</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> shows actual snapshots from the MD trajectories for this type of PT. Unlike the PT mechanisms in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, which involved the transfer of only a single proton, the solvent-assisted PT involves the concerted transfer of 
 <italic>two</italic> protons: one proton is donated 
 <italic>to</italic> the solvent H
 <sub>2</sub>O by an adsorbed O*H
 <sub>2</sub>, and one proton is donated 
 <italic>by</italic> the solvent H
 <sub>2</sub>O to an adsorbed O*H
 <sup>–</sup>. Solvent-assisted PT proceeds 
 <italic>via</italic> transiently formed solvent OH
 <sup>–</sup> and OH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> species, that are not stable intermediates (ESI Fig. 3 and 5
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). The events are quite rare. For example, in the 44 ns long simulation for ZnO(101[combining macron]0), only 41 solvent-assisted PT events were observed.
