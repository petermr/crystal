  <p>a) Optical micrograph of a typical device used for the electric field induced alignment, containing eight electrode pairs on a 80 × 80 µm
   <sup>2</sup> Si
   <sub>3</sub>N
   <sub>4</sub> membrane window (copper‐colored square). b) Schematic of a device showing the suspended membrane containing eight patterned electrode pairs with different gap widths 
   <italic>W</italic> (0.5–20 µm) and lengths 
   <italic>L</italic> (0.1–1.1 µm). c) Schematic of the alignment experiment: voltage is applied to the electrodes, while a drop of solution containing QRs dries on the surface. The p‐doped Si layer is grounded. d) TEM image of randomly oriented 38 nm × 3.4 nm CdSe QRs, used in that study, imaged on a holy carbon grid. e) TEM image of aligned QRs, artificially colored in red.
