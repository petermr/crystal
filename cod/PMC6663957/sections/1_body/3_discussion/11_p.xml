<p id="Par67">Since the implementation of block geometry in the STIR library was based on calculating LOR parameters directly from the Cartesian coordinates of detection points, this opens a door to extend the library to more generic geometries, i.e., to any arrangement of the so-called cylindrical PET scanners such that there is no limitation in the size and number of crystals, blocks of crystals, and modules of blocks as long as they stay in a ringed-shape geometry.</p>
