<p>In this section these results are compared with experiments. For that purpose, the DFT calculations of the energetically most stable superstructures of Section 3
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3"/> were repeated with higher precision and applying dispersion correction (PBEsol-D), which is expected to improve the agreement between the calculated and experimental lattice parameters as pointed out in Section 2.2
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.2"/>. Furthermore, the unified superspace model of the last section was used to predict additional superstructures with different compositions (M11, M14, M20, M43, M45), including compositions that are expected to be unstable according to the phase diagram (M11, M14). Selected characteristics of the superstructures are given in Table 1
