<p id="Par12">Hydrated Na-bir was synthesized in an aqueous solution using a CEM Discover microwave accelerated reactor system (MARS 5). Concentrated NaMnO
 <sub>4</sub> (40 wt% in H
 <sub>2</sub>O) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. In a typical procedure, the NaMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution (2.5 mL) was added to deionized water (40 mL) in a 100 mL microwave reaction vessel. The solution was then heated to 220 °C for 6 h under the sealed vessel mode with microwave irradiation. This microwave reaction was conducted in air atmosphere. The resulting brownish-black solid product was isolated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water three times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. To obtain the partially dehydrated Na-bir and fully dehydrated Na-bir, the brownish-black solid product was each heat-treated at 170 and 300 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to remove the crystal water between MnO
 <sub>6</sub> slabs. The synthesized samples were sealed to avoid atmospheric moisture before use.
