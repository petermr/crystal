<p>Heusler compounds are a promising class of materials because they demonstrate various exciting physical properties, for example, superconductivity, thermoelectricity, hard magnetism, magnetic semiconductors, and Berry curvature-induced topology. One of the main advantages of these materials is that their properties can easily be tuned simply by varying their valence electrons. This class of compounds have empirical formula XYZ (half Heusler) and X
 <sub>2</sub>YZ (full Heusler), where X and Y are transition metals and Z is a main group element.

 </sup> Full Heusler compound X
 <sub>2</sub>YZ can be of two types: regular Heusler and inverse Heusler. Normally, the compounds crystallize in cubic structures except when the Y or/and Z elements are heavy metals with large spin–orbit coupling, in which case the crystal field effect becomes large enough to induce a tetragonal distortion. The regular cubic Heusler structure (
 <italic>Fm</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic>) and the inverse cubic Heusler structure (
 <italic>F</italic>4̅3
 <italic>m</italic>), therefore, transform into tetragonal Heusler structures having space groups 
 <italic>I</italic>4/
 <italic>mmm</italic> and 
 <italic>I</italic>4̅
 <italic>m</italic>2, respectively.
