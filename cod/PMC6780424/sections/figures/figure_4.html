 <caption> Bond number vs time plots for the shocked ε-CL-20 crystal, BTF crystal, CL-20/NMP/H 2O cocrystal and TATB crystal. The chemical bonds counted included N–N, H–C, H–N, H–O, C–C, C–N, C–O, N–O and O–O bonds. The sign of the initiation of the reaction under shock was a continuous reduction in the number of trigger bonds. </caption>
