<p>Firstly, as revealed in [
 <xref rid="B118-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], there are ‘uncontrollable parameters’ in the diamond turning process, which include the material defects, tool wear and lubrication condition, etc. Their main characteristic is the random property which results in that it is rather hard to theoretically model their effects. Therefore, in the practical application, it is suggested to introduce the probability method to analyze their effects. For instance, defects such as voids, grain boundary and hard particles are extensively observed in the aluminium alloy material matrix; He et al. employed the uniform distribution coupled with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test method to model the distribution of additional heights in relation to material defects, which effectively improve the prediction accuracy of 3D surface topography model [
