Moreover, it is possible to see that we are even obtaining better results than other works carrying out the calcination at higher temperatures. Furthermore, our calcination process is clearly faster than the others, confirming the low impact of the time on the obtained properties. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that short calcinations at high temperatures are probably the best option is reinforced.
