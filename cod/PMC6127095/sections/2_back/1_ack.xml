This research used resources at the High Flux Isotope Reactor, a DOE Office of Science User Facility operated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for magnetic structure refinement (HC). High-pressure floating-zone technique was employed for single crystal growth under the supervision of JY and BCS who are supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering.</p>
