<p id="Par18">A plausible and alternative activation to the electron doping mechanism described above is the gradual removal of surface oxides which are present on the catalyst surface. It is possible that nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> is initially oxidized, and when subjected to cathodic bias the surface oxides are reduced and removed from the surface, thus revealing the true catalytic material. With this in mind, XPS studies were carried out under inert atmosphere in an attempt to observe any changes in oxidation state after cycling. Accordingly, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref> shows the high resolution 3d Mo and 3d Te XPS spectra, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">28</xref> for comparative spectra on samples exposed to ambient atmosphere). It is clear that there is only minor oxygen content after 100 CV cycles as evidenced by the broad shoulder which may indicate slight oxidation of the activated material. The peak shifts are within the resolution error of the instrument (0.1 eV) and are unlikely to be due to any substantial changes in oxidation state. Therefore, from this perspective, it is unlikely that the reduction of the oxidized surface could be the cause of activation (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">29</xref>).
