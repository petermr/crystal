<p>It is important to realize that most of the errors were found by warnings in the convergence of the DFT optimization and subsequently manually corrected. It was therefore important to monitor this optimization step and double-check the input structure of problematic runs. Problems in the initial structure are typically missing hydrogen atoms, incorrect elements, highly unfavorable protonation states, overlapping atoms (originated by the parsing of partial occupations), and incorrect unit-cell dimensions.</p>
