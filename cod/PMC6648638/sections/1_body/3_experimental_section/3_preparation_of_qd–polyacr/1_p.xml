The mixture was uniformly mixed and then spin-coated on the glass substrate. The single-color organic light-emitting film was obtained by photopolymerization using 36 W UV light for 1.5 min. The thickness of the organic light-emitting film was controlled at about 1 mm by adjusting the speed of spin-coating.
