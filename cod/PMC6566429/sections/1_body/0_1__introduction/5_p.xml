<p>In this paper, we present a 0.22 THz all-electronic one-input four-output imaging radar system. The radar system operates in frequency modulated pulse mode with a bandwidth of 5 GHz, and its pulse width, duty circle, and time delay of local oscillator signal can be set flexibly. This design is for the application of connecting traveling-wave tube amplifier to develop long-distance experiments in the future. Compared with the single-channel SAR/ISAR imaging system, our system can achieve 3-D images of objects through interferometry technique [

 <xref rid="B31-sensors-19-02330" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], where the altitude information can be obtained from the phase difference of ISAR images of different receiving channels. To verify the system performance, interferometric inverse synthetic aperture radar (InISAR) imaging experiments were carried out, and necessary signal processing methods had been applied to acquire high-quality InISAR images.
