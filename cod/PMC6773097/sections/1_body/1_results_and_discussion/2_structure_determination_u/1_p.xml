<p>Preliminary characterizations of SSZ‐27 using XRPD revealed several unindexed peaks, which were identified as coming from quartz and SSZ‐26 (
 <bold>CON</bold>) impurity phases (Supporting Information). In view of the fact that obtaining a pure sample of SSZ‐27 was proving to be difficult (more on this below), we opted to collect electron diffraction (ED) data using the continuous rotation method,

 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> which offers a combination of fast acquisition times and high data completeness, because all of reciprocal space is sampled. We used a recently developed crystal tracking routine to ensure that the crystal stayed in the electron beam during rotation

 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> This makes it easier to collect data with high rotation ranges, and at the same time enables more accurate integration of the reflection intensities for structure refinement. Diffraction data were collected on eighteen isolated crystals between 200 and 1000 nm in size over three sessions (Supporting information Table S2 and Figure S2). Unit cell determination, indexing, and intensity integration were performed using XDS
