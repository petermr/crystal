  <italic>LSITESYM</italic> for the study of materials with layer and multilayer symmetry. This new program, based on the site-symmetry approach, establishes the symmetry relations between localized and extended crystal states using representations of layer groups. The efficiency and utility of the program 
  <italic>LSITESYM</italic> is demonstrated by illustrative examples, which include the analysis of phonon symmetry in Aurivillius compounds and in van der Waals layered crystals MoS
  <sub>2</sub> and WS
