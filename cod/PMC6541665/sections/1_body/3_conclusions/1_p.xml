<p id="Par24">In conclusion, we successfully used mini-CSPLED BLU as the blue light and excitation energy source, along with QD films, to produce a uniform white backlight. Mini-CSPLEDs were subjected to emission angle packaged structure fabricate for 120°, 150°, and 180° to verify that the mini-CSPLED optical performance had significant differences. The lager emission angle and an illumination area of 180° mini-CSPLED improved significantly when compared with that of the 120° mini-CSPLED and 150° mini-CSPLED. Impressively, 180° mini-CSPLED BLU with a 150-μm-thick QD film achieved an excellent uniform brightness planar white light source for backlight displays of approximately 86%, which is significant for the future ultra-thin display technology. We implemented highly reliable CSP technology that can protect the LED chip, solve the emission angle and illumination area problems of LEDs, and fabricate a backlight source for displays with good brightness uniformity.</p>
