 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the threading edge dislocation created by the cooling of SiC crystal. A misoriented crystal grew because of the presence of this dislocation (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The high energy concentration in that region led to creating slip bands that caused the atomic plane to slide as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. The dislocation movement resulted in the generation of two extra half planes indicated by the black dots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f003">Figure 3</xref>c to reduce the energy in the unit cell. This allowed crystal structure to be stabilized.
