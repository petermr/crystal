<p>Analysis between 30° and 70° in 2θ showed the presence of structural disorders associated with the rotation and translational stacking faults of the layers, as demonstrated in phyllosilicate minerals [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), in the range mentioned above, had diffraction peaks located at 2.91, 2.47, 2.40, 2.29, 2.17, 1.81, 1.43, 1.39, and 1.35 Å, which are in agreement with those reported for triclinic birnessite [

 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For Mn8 it was observed that X-rays diffracted at angles of 12.42°, 25.06°, 36.48°, 38.54°, 41.36°, 44.48°, 44.80°, and 53.46° 2θ, which correspond to interplanar spacing of 7.12, 3.55, 2.46, 2.33, 2.18, 2.03, 2.02, and 1.71 Å, respectively. These are characteristic of a hexagonal birnessite [
