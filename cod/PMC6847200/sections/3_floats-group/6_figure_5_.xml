  <p>Interactions mediated by the U75-C76 J3/1 insertion element. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Local structure of the J3/1 element (nucleotides U75–C78) in the 
   <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II riboswitch aptamer domain and its interaction with ligand. Base-base interactions are denoted by grey dashed lines. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Local structure of J3/1 (nucleotides A73–C74) and its interactions with ligand (hypoxanthine, HX) in the 
   <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch aptamer domain. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Base pairing interaction between U75 of the J3/1 insertion element and A24. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Indirect water-mediated interaction between A73 and the U22–A52 base pair in the 
   <italic>xpt</italic> riboswitch (4FE5). Note that these highly ordered waters are consistently observed across multiple high-resolution crystal structures of the 
   <italic>xpt</italic> riboswitch. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Direct interaction between A77 and the U22–A52 base pair in the junction.
