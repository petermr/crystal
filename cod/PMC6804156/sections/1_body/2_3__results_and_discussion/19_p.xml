<p>The quantum efficiencies (
 <italic>QE</italic>) of all prepared samples as a function of excitation wavelength and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentrations are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The 
 <italic>QE</italic> value for the 50% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> doped sample is close to unity under 393.5 nm excitation. Such high 
 <italic>QE</italic> value is very favourable for practical application. Further increase of the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration resulted in decreased 
 <italic>QE</italic> values under the same excitation wavelength. Moreover, excitation at 265 and 465 nm has also resulted in somewhat lower 
 <italic>QE</italic> values. This leads to a conclusion that the synthesized phosphors in practical application should be used with near-UV emitting LEDs.
