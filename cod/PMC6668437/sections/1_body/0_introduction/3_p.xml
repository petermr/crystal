<p id="Par5">On the basis of these considerations we have grown single crystals of EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (a previously reported compound
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>) and YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (not a previously reported compound). Our ARPES, magnetization and magneto-optical microscopy measurements clearly demonstrate the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in one of the materials, YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>, in excellent agreement with the calculations considering a canted antiferromagnetic order. Two kinds of fully relativistic calculations reveal a number of Weyl points and predict YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> to be the first canted antiferromagnet hosting a magnetic Weyl state of the second type
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. We detect the Weyl points as well as an extra state (Fermi arc) of the Fermi surface both experimentally by ARPES and theoretically by semi-infinite-slab calculations. Our findings provide evidence for a TRS-breaking-induced type-II Weyl state that is present in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>.
