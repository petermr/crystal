 <caption> Recording schemes of a HAXPES experiment using a k-imaging time-of-flight spectrometer ( a) in comparison with a dispersive hemispherical spectrometer ( b). In ( a), 3D data arrays I( E kin, k x , k y ) are recorded using a delay-line detector. There is no beam-confining slit (except the field aperture selecting the region of interest in real space). In ( b), 2D arrays I( E kin,θ) are recorded and the second angular coordinate is varied either by sample rotation or by deflectors in the lens optics. The desired energy resolution demands a sufficiently ‘thin’ isochrone surface with small width Δ t at the entrance of the ToF section ( a) and a sufficiently narrow entrance slit with width Δ x at the entrance of the hemisphere ( b). </caption>
