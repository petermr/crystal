<p>A sizeable dataset was taken for the UHV prepared sample [TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)-(2 × 1)], comprising 10 419 reflections from 21 CTRs and 23 FORs that after averaging, using 
 <italic>pg</italic> symmetry, were reduced to 5991 non-equivalent reflections. Subsequent to this, the chamber pump was switched off and the sample was exposed to a static pressure of ∼30 mbar of ultra-pure H
 <sub>2</sub>O via back filling of the chamber, which equates to about twelve monolayers.

 </sup> The chamber pump remained switched off for the duration of measurements. A further 4978 reflections from 22 CTRs were measured from this surface that reduced to 3507 non-equivalent reflections after averaging by the same symmetry. Water was thoroughly degassed using several freeze–pump–thaw cycles, with cleanliness confirmed by mass spectrometry (MKS Microvision Plus). Here, the partial pressure of water was increased to ∼10 mbar in the baby chamber and, through a precision leak valve, the differentially pumped mass spectrometer was exposed to a maximum of ∼1 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> mbar H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Several masses were recorded simultaneously (O = 16, H
 <sub>2</sub>O = 18, CO = 28, O
 <sub>2</sub> = 32, CO
 <sub>2</sub> = 44, CH
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> = 29, 46 and CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH = 43, 45, 60). While there was an increase of CO and CO
 <sub>2</sub> to ∼1 × 10
 <sup>–8</sup> mbar and ∼5 × 10
 <sup>–9</sup> mbar, respectively, there was no indication of formic or acetic acid evolution.
