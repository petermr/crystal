<p id="p0125">One can cite some 
 <italic>a priori</italic> objection to the previously mentioned qualitative reasoning, from which it follows that there is a singularity (that is, zero or infinity) in the rates of molecular transitions. This objection is that the nuclei, even because of their substantial inertia, cannot return an excited light electron to its original ground state since the electron is already in a well-defined quantum state from which it cannot escape because of the presence of an energy gap in the electronic energy according to quantum mechanics. Therefore, in the excited state, the electron is forced to slowly adjust the nuclear subsystem to its new charge distribution. This constitutes the essence of the Franck-Condon principle. However, our 
 <italic>a priori</italic> objection and the Franсk-Condon principle itself are entirely based on the 
 <italic>a priori</italic> assumption that quantum mechanics works in this case. As previously mentioned, this assumption has no formal evidence. Moreover, qualitative considerations about the continuous energy spectrum in the transient state, which appears due to the electron provocation of chaos in the vibrational motion of the nuclei to control their motion in this state (as previously mentioned), indicate that in reality there is no gap in the electronic energy, and consequently, quantum mechanics ceases to work in a transient dynamic molecular state. In other words, the excited electron in principle cannot be “hooked” into the quantum state, which follows from the standard solution to Schrödinger's equation, and therefore it quickly “rolls” over the continuous spectrum of energy to the ground state, as discussed in our initial qualitative reasoning.
