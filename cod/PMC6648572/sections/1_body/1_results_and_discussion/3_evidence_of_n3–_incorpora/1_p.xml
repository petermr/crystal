<p>The infrared (IR) spectra of Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) compounds before and after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping are shown in

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>. As the chemical bond of Si–O is stronger than that of M–O (M = Li, Ca, Sr, and Ba), the internal vibrations of SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra are nearly independent of the lattice vibrations and exclusively observed in the 400–1000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> range. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>, the [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] internal modes are assigned to the Si–O stretching modes

 </sup> the reduced mass (μ) of M–O (μ = 11.43 for Ca–O, μ = 13.53 for Sr–O, μ = 14.33 for Ba–O), and the M–O stretching modes are estimated to be 314 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> for Ca–O stretching, 257 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> for Sr–O stretching, and 239 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> for Ba–O stretching. Remarkably, the Si–O stretching modes between 770 and 950 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are somewhat decreased after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, which implies that the N
 <sup>3–</sup> ions are partially substituted into the Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) host lattice. The Gaussian-fitted IR modes of LSSO and LSSON between 1100 and 770 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>) corroborate the presence of N
 <sup>3–</sup> ions substituted into the host lattice, i.e., after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, the sub-band centered at 825 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> shifts to the band with a maximum at 817 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. This chemical shift can be easily explained by a comparison of the chemical bond distance (1.62 Å for SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and 1.73 Å for α-Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,

 <sub>2</sub> and 426 kJ/mol for α-Si
 <sub>3</sub>N

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
 </sup> between SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results warrant the evidence of N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, closely related to the red shift of the Si–O stretching modes (from IR measurement) in these compounds. 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure

 <sub>2</sub>, ref α-Si
 <sub>3</sub>N

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>, the Si 2p binding energy (ref SiO
 <sub>2</sub>) is 102.8 eV with a single Gaussian band (Full width at half-maximum = 1.9 eV), whereas the Si 2p binding energies (ref α-Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>) is composed of two bands (101.4 and 102.8 eV). In the Si 2p binding energy (ref α-Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>), the sub-band at 102.8 eV may be due to superficial oxidation. The Gaussian-fitted LSSO and LSSON XPS images (middle) reveal that the Si 2p binding energy of LSSON (100.7 eV) is lower than that of LSSO (101.5 eV), which means that the N
 <sup>3–</sup> ions are partially substituted into the LSSO crystal lattice. Furthermore, the N 1s binding energy (393.4 eV) of LSSON corroborates the N
 <sup>3–</sup> introduction in the LSSO host lattice.
