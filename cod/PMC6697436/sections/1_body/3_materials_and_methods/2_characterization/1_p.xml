<p>Single-crystal XRD measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer equipped with a Triumph monochromator and a Photon100 area detector, operating with Mo Kα radiation. HRTEM was performed on a large lamella fabricated by FIB. The longitudinal electrical resistance measurement was conducted using a standard four-probe method with the alternating current (AC) transport option in a physical property measurement system (PPMS). XPS spectra were carried on a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) surface analysis system equipped with a Scienta-200 hemispherical analyzer. The base pressure of the sample analysis chamber is 2 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> mbar. Magnetization measurements were carried out on oriented crystals with the magnetic field applied along the 
 <italic>a</italic> axes on the vibrating sample magnetometer (MPMS 3, Quantum Design). For STM, Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals were cleaved in situ at 
 <italic>T</italic> &lt; 20 K to expose a (001) surface. After cleaving, the samples are quickly transferred to the STM head and kept in ultrahigh vacuum (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 3 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> Pa) and at low temperature (
 <italic>T</italic> = 2 K). The tunneling spectra were measured using tungsten tips acquired by the standard lock-in technique.
