<p>Nanosys also employed edge‐lit optics, particularly with films that generate trichromatic light with the right white color point, allowing a color filter to produce a wider color gamut than could be achieved with bichromatic light from a down‐converting yellow phosphor.

The scattering particles were introduced in order to maximize the light usage. Nanosys' QDEFs can be used with either an edge‐lit or a direct‐lit BLU, which replaces the diffuser film by inserting red and green emitting QDs inside a film illuminated by blue LEDs (Figure
