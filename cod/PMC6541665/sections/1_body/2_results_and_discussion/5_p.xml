 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a–e show the light distribution images of 120° mini-CSPLED BLU, 150° mini-CSPLED BLU, and 180° mini-CSPLED BLU with and without a diffusor and different QD film thicknesses. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a shows the light distribution images of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED blue BLUs without diffusor and QD films. By placing the diffusion plate on the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs, it can be seen that the 180° mini-CSPLED BLU has a better uniform planar light compared to the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU and 150° mini-CSPLED BLU. However, the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU and the 150° mini-CSPLED BLU show the stripe patterns, in which the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU is the most visible, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. Similarly, as shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c–e, the QD films are placed on the diffusion plate, and as the QD film thickness is increased, the light distribution images of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs clearly presented that the BLU brightness is increased and is closer to white light; the stripe pattern is also less and less unobvious. The light distribution images observations are in good agreement with the CIE chromaticity coordinates (
