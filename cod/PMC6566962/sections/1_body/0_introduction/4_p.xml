<p>In the present study, we investigate the crystal structure of the η″ phase with two different compositions, by using single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and electron diffraction combined with atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), as we have successfully applied to the crystal structure refinement of a series of intermetallics of the Fe-Zn system formed on galvanized/galvannealed steels [
