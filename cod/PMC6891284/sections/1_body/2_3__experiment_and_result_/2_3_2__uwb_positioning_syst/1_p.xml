<p>The mobile node of the UWB positioning system is installed on the head of the robot and the reference nodes are deployed at the four top corners of a square whose side is 15 m long. The installation height of the reference nodes is 2.25 m. The computer software reads the position coordinates of the UWB positioning system using UDP. The control signal is sent to the main control board through the ROS platform in order to control the motor so that the delivery robot runs along the red track in

Situation I is comprised of three groups of experiments and the number of people within the scope of the experimental area is less than four. While situation II is made up of two groups of experiments and there are more than 10 people within the experimental area. In addition, the other obstacles such as tables and chairs are identical in both situations. The track of the delivery robot positioned by the UWB positioning system is shown in
