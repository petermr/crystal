<p>The static deformation density is based on the difference between the total ED from the MM and a spherical reference ED from the IAM. This already provides a very informative picture of the ED distribution around the metal atoms. Regions of negative charge concentrations are depicted in light blue and those of negative charge depletion in orange (Figure 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> c and d). Interestingly, the number of charge‐concentration regions coincides in both Co

 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> shows only six minima, each directed to the negatively charged oxygen atom of the phosphate, already fueling the idea of an electrostatic Co−O interaction. In contrast, Co

Five of the vertices point to a coordinated phosphate oxygen atom each and the remaining three exposed minima are left uncoordinated, indicating free coordination sites.
