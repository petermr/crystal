<p id="Par15">In our previous work on dissociated vacancies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, we derived an analytical model of the energetics of the dissociated vacancy based on both elasticity theory and electrostatics. In this subsection, we revisit that model. We use linear elasticity theory of dislocations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup> to derive the dislocation-jog interactions and compare with the atomistic results in MgO. The elasticity model is schematically illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, and similar to our previous work
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. A segment of dislocation 
 <italic>a</italic> climbed a height of 
 <italic>h</italic>, to form a jog-pair of width 
 <italic>w</italic>. In the periodic dipole supercell, the distance between the screw dislocation dipole (
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) is 
 <italic>L</italic>.
