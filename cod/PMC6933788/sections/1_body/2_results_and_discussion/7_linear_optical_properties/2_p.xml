 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a). The largest reflective index is in the (0 0 1) direction and the (H

 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sup>−</sup> groups is in parallel to the light incident direction in the unit cell (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b). Thus, the largest contribution to birefringence comes from the (H
 <sub>2</sub>C

 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sup>−</sup> groups. The birefringence was further investigated by using visualized total electron density and electron localized function map (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>c). It can be inferred that (H

 <sup>−</sup> holds high electron densities owing to strong covalent C–N and C–O bond. A nonspherical symmetric density distribution is clearly presented around each N (no hydrogenation) and O atom, which is composed of umbrella-shaped N 2s lone pairs and O nonbonding 2p electrons. Six parallel p
 <sub>π</sub> electrons are uniformly distributed at the C
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub> ring, thus corresponding to a π-conjugated group; the π-conjugated groups produce strong anisotropy to be conducive to birefringence. We also calculated the bond population of Rb

It can be found that the bond population of the H–O, C–O, C–N, and N–H groups are in the range of 0.98–0.99, 0.6–1.06, 0.78–0.98, and 0.69–0.72, respectively. It indicates that the H–O, C–O, C–N, and N–H groups display strong covalent property. As is known to all, the covalent property is beneficial for optical anisotropy and generating large birefringence for the compounds. In conclusion, the large birefringence of Rb
