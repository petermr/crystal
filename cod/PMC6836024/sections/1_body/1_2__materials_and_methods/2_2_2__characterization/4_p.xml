<p>The emission spectra were measured using the 266 nm excitation line from a laser diode (LD) and a Silver-Nova Super Range TEC Spectrometer form Stellarnet (1 nm spectral resolution) as a detector. The temperature of the sample was controlled using a THMS600 heating stage from Linkam (0.1 1C temperature stability and 0.1 1C set point resolution).</p>
