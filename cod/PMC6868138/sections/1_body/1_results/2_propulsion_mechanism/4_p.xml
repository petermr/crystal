<p id="Par14">We used light-responsive chiral dopants that behave differently in response to light. The possibility to vary the confinement of the cholesteric helix in the drop allowed investigating droplets that show different swimming behaviors and to unravel the role of chirality in the chirality of their motion. The chirality confinement ratio 
 <italic>N</italic> = 2
 <italic>d/p</italic>, where 
 <italic>d</italic> is the diameter of the liquid crystal droplet and 
 <italic>p</italic> is the pitch, corresponds to the number of spiral turns in the drop and therefore it can be used to quantify the chiral character of the drop and how it varies during motion.
