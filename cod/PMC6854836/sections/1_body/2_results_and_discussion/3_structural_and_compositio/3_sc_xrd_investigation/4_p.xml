<p>The crucial hint on how to improve became evident when removing the constraint of equal ADPs between Si
 <sup>p</sup> and B
 <sup>p</sup> atoms (model 
 <bold>2</bold>). The resulting 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and Δρ values were again reduced significantly and the composition swung back to SiB
 <sub>2.58(1)</sub>. The split B
 <sup>p</sup>–Si
 <sup>p</sup> distance decreased to 0.28 Å and the ADP of the B
 <sup>p</sup> atom almost doubled (
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>eq</sub> = 0.019 Å
 <sup>2</sup>) and became strongly prolate, with the long axis pointing toward the Si
 <sup>p</sup> atom. The largest negative 
 <italic>Q</italic>-peak of −1.14 e/Å
 <sup>3</sup> is now located inside the icosahedron close to the B
 <sup>p</sup> atom. This B
 <sup>p</sup> position is now conveniently split into two individual boron positions B
 <sup>p,Si</sup> and B
 <sup>p,B</sup> (model 
 <bold>3</bold>) after which the negative 
 <italic>Q</italic>-peak disappeared, along with a further reduced 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. (The notation B
 <sup>p,
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sup> has been chosen to indicate that the boron atom shows a reasonable exo-distance with respect to an atom A in the neighboring icosahedron.) Note that the ADP for these split boron atoms was kept equal for stability reasons and the sum of the occupancies for B
 <sup>p,Si</sup>, B
 <sup>p,B</sup>, and Si
 <sup>p</sup> was constrained to unity.
