 </xref> provides a schematic illustration of the algorithm on a BCA C–C bond. The volume of the DORI domains (in blue) associated with the bond increases with decreasing DORI-
 <italic>f</italic> until the merging occurs (visible in red). This covalent bond is properly captured at DORI-
 <italic>f</italic> values, for which the three basins defining this bond are merged into one basin. Because the annulene ring of the BCA is composed of 14 C–C bonds, the value used to study the pressure-induced bonding modifications corresponds to the average 
 <italic>f</italic> value of the 28 merging points (see
