 <italic>S</italic> wave polarization anisotropy has a complex pattern. The maximum 
 <italic>S</italic> wave polarization anisotropy (6.1%) is observed for 
 <italic>S</italic> waves propagating obliquely to all three main crystallographic axes, close to [111] directions. These 
 <italic>S</italic> waves are polarized parallel to &lt;uv0&gt; directions. Low 
 <italic>S</italic> wave polarization anisotropy (&lt;2%) is observed for propagation directions along (100) and (010) planes, except parallel to [001] and [100], where intermediate polarization anisotropy values (2.5‐3%) and fast polarizations parallel to [100] are observed. Apparent 
 <italic>S</italic> wave polarization isotropy is observed for propagation parallel to [010] or within approximately 25° of [100].
