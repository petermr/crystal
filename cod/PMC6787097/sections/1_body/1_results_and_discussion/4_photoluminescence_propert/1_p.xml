 <sup>3+</sup>, and only the 232 nm centric broadband excitation peak was observed. After Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> incorporation, the main peak showed a red-shift, and the excitation peak appeared at 257 nm, 273 nm, and 284 nm. Therefore, we determined the broadband strong excitation band (220–300 nm) with the peak of 248 nm in Fig.

 <sup>3+</sup> Within the range of 300–500 nm, a series of very weak excitation peaks caused by f → f transition of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> ions can be observed. The emission peaks of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> may be located at 589 nm and 613 nm, respectively, in order to exclude the interference from the Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> emission, the emission wavelength of 704 nm is selected as the monitoring wavelength, the strong excitation peaks at 248 nm and a series of excitation peaks caused by the superposition of the f → f transition from Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> and the 4f → 4f transition of the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> are also observed

 <sup>3+</sup> were observed when the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> characteristic emission was monitored. This result confirms that the energy transfer of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> may be effective.
