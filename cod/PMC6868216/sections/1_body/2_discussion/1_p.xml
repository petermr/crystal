<p id="Par18">To conclude, we have designed and successfully synthesized the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated broad-band-emitting NIR phosphor with super-broad excitation band from 250 to 600 nm. Under 460 nm blue light excitation, K

 <sup>2+</sup> shows an unprecedented broad NIR emission band peaking at 740 nm and also demonstrates a high FHWM of 160 nm. Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> selectively occupancy at Lu and K2 sites, and the small coordination numbers and small average bond lengths lead to the as-observed NIR emission with characteristic 4

 <sup>2+</sup> phosphors have been applied in night-vision devices and demonstrated potential applications. This finding gives the feasibility of the feasible strategy to discover Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doped NIR phosphor with large redshift by occupying polyhedrons with small coordination numbers. More importantly, it initiates a new way to explore NIR phosphors, i.e. achieve NIR emission by Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doping in the solid-state materials.
