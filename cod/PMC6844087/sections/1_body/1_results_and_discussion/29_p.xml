<p>The behavior seen in 
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>
 </xref> is similar to the one previously discussed in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>: spherical-shaped nanometric particles sinter by thermal processes, forming micrometric clusters. Nanoparticles have been clearly formed, but the applied thermal energy produces this sintering effect between particles. Therefore, an equilibrium needs to be found to maximize the ferrite purity and to avoid sintering. Once the maximum purity is reached, as happens in this second batch, it is recommended to work at the lower possible temperature and time to reduce the agglomeration.
