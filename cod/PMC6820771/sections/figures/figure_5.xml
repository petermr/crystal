   <bold>a</bold> 3d Mo XPS spectra of activated (after 100 cycles) and non-activated nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe

   <bold>b</bold> 3d Te XPS spectra of activated and non-activated nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
   <sub>2</sub>. 
   <bold>c</bold> Cyclic voltammograms showing the consequent deactivation of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
   <sub>2</sub> in 1 M H
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub> under a nitrogen atmosphere using a scan rate of 10 mV s
   <sup>−1</sup>. During the first anodic sweep, two oxidations occur followed by a decrease in current density at cathodic potentials indicating catalyst deactivation.

   <sub>2</sub> before and after 100 cycles during which the edge sites are reversibly oxidized/reduced. Measurements were performed in 1 M H
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub> under a nitrogen atmosphere with a scan rate of 100 mV s
