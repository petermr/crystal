<p>The chemical antioxidant capacities of H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 and its Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complexes were studied based on the original procedures of the ABTS [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and DPPH [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] assays, with slight modifications. A dose–response curve was constructed as a function of the concentration of each complex, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined. The concentration of ABTS in ethanolic solution was adjusted so that the absorbance was 0.7 ± 0.02 at 754 nm, and the concentration of a DPPH methanolic solution was adjusted to show the absorbance 0.7 ± 0.02 at 515 nm. First, 245 µL of the ABTS radical solution was placed in every well of a 96 well microplate (Costar
 <sup>®</sup>, USA). Then 5 µL of sample solutions at concentrations 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM were added to wells. After 5 min of incubation, the absorbance of each tested solution was read at 754 nm on an Omega spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech Inc., Ortenberf, Germany). For DPPH, 280 µL of the solution was placed in each well of the microplate, and 20 µL of sample solutions of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM were added to different wells. After 30 min of incubation, the absorbance was read at 515 nm.
