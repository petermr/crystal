<p id="Par17">Further, we will use the image peculiarity of the XRDT 2D projections that are directly linked with strongly distorted regions near around a single defect core. As is shown in
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>, in such the regions the X-ray diffraction scattering is, in general, kinematical owing to the interbranch scattering of the Bloch X-ray waves. Physically, it does mean that the so-called 
 <italic>direct</italic> defect image contrast on the XRDT 2D projections is due to the diffracted wave propagation through the strongly distorted crystal region along the wave vector
