<p>In this work, co-crystals of progesterone with 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 4,4′-biphenol were synthesized by slow evaporation and with a molar ratio of 1:1. The crystal structures have been presented and discussed in detail in this paper. Specifically, CNA and DHB, which present similar molecule configurations, show a rather diverse hydrogen bonding network when they co-crystallize with PROG. Both CNA and DHB work as a powerful “traffic hub” which generates a complex hydrogen bonding pattern in the co-crystal structure and multiple weak interactions. The linear shape of the DOD molecule generates a broader connectivity pattern that, to some extent, may help in the prediction of the crystal/co-crystal structure. Additionally, all the co-crystal structures were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The dissolution tests indicate that faster rates and higher concentrations of PROG were attained after the co-crystallization, especially for PROG-CNA. This might be attributable to more stable and abundant interactions which are composed of multiple C-H···N hydrogen bonds and α···π interactions between CNA and PROG. In the long term, the investigation of crystal structures provides positive support for the selection of suitable co-formers using the crystal engineering strategies.</p>
