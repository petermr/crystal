<p>By investigating the relationship between the creep curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and nanocrystalline NiAl model amorphization, we found that the height and shape of the RDF peaks at 1200 K did not change much with time, but the peaks at 1400 K changed significantly with time. This is because the model entered the tertiary creep stage at 40 ps and 1400 K, and the creep rate was faster than at steady-state creep. Therefore, the height of the peaks in the RDF curve dropped significantly. Another conclusion can be derived from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref>, namely that the crystalline structure of the model remains substantially stable when the creep deformation process is in a steady state.
