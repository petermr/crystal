<p>The introduction of 2D RPPs into 3D perovskites has been proved to guarantee a high efficiency and improved stability of the solar cells.[qv: 149d] For example, Liu's group reported a high PCE of 20.62% for 2D/3D heterostructure solar cells. The devices demonstrated significant long‐term ambient stability and worked for more than 2880 h when the efficiency dropped to 80% of the initial value without encapsulation.

The highest PCE (&gt;22%) for 2D/3D perovskite solar cell was achieved by Grätzel's group, and the solar cells showed remarkable stability with 90% efficiency of 1000 h in moist air under simulated sunlight. The excellent performance comes from the formation of ultrathin, ultra‐hydrophobic, and highly uniform 2D (FEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> (FEA = phenylethylammonium) perovskite film casted on the 3D perovskite layer. The incorporation of (FEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> not only protects FAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> film from the influence of moisture due to its hydrophobicity of fluoroarene, but also promotes the hole transfer from perovskite layer to spiro‐OMeTAD.
