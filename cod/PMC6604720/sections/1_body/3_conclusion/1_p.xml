<p>A facile, water-based, rapid synthesis method for the fabrication of lanthanide-doped hydroxide-based phosphors at room temperature is presented. Introducing acetate-based metals and lanthanides into the LiOH/water solvent system (specifically, yttrium and europium acetates, for this study) demonstrated rapid crystallization of lanthanide-doped hydroxides. These crystals were driven by a crystal splitting growth mechanism that leads to the formation of a multipod structure. Furthermore, this method allows the controlled doping ratio by varying the dopant concentration. The fabricated red-emitting Y(OH)

For future applications, this study may lead to fabrication of various phosphors doped with different lanthanides that can result in a targeted color emission. In this sense, one can produce a white LED system composed of a UV-LED chip with red–green–blue phosphors since the method presented here offers an easy, inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthesis for the fabrication of these phosphors.
