<p>Single crystal silicon wafers containing a layer of native oxide (Siegert Wafer, Germany) were used as substrates. Prior to use, the wafers were cut and cleaned subsequently in acetone, ethanol, and NaOH. Finally, they were rinsed with deionized water and blown dry under a nitrogen stream. Such substrates have isotropic surface properties. Thin films of phenytoin were fabricated by spin coating on top of the clean and dry substrates. For this, the substrate is mounted horizontally on a standard device and, after the deposition of 200 Î¼L solution, the sample is put into rotation at a speed of 17 rps for 60 s to spread the liquid. After solvent removal, the film was crystallized. To maximize the amount of the new phase, the entire setup and the solution were placed inside an oven at 304 K. The optimization results are provided in the
