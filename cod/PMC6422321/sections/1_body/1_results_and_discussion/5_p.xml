<p>The photophysical properties of the coatings were studied by means of photoexcitation and PL spectroscopies using a spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh FLS1000). The excitation wavelength (λ
 <sub>ex</sub>) was varied from 250 to 320 nm. The results for a particular configuration, namely a bilayer stack composed of ∼300 nm of GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and ∼200 nm of GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> annealed films, are shown in

 </xref>a. Notice that the thickness of each nanophosphor layer can be precisely controlled through the concentration of the nanophosphor dispersion and the deposition speed. As a result, the film thickness can be processed with a precision of a few nanometers. Interestingly, the PL spectra are extremely dependent on the excitation wavelength. This is a direct consequence of the layered structure of the coating. In the selected example, light encounters first the GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> layer and then the GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> one. The shorter the wavelength, the smaller is the penetration depth in the stack. Hence, for 250 nm ≤ λ
 <sub>ex</sub> ≤ 290, all incoming intensities are practically absorbed by the GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> layer and hardly reach the second GdVO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> layer. Hence, the features of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> dominate over those of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> in the PL spectrum. As the photoexcitation wavelength increases, the penetration depth also increases, and the balance between the contributions from both species improves, as it can be seen for those spectra attained when photoexciting with 295 nm ≤ λ
 <sub>ex</sub> ≤ 320. This is further illustrated in

 </xref>b, in which the PL spectra attained when illuminating the same bilayer at either λ = 275 nm (black) or λ = 300 nm (gray) are plotted. Although both emissions lie in the achromatic region of the chromaticity space, their spectral composition is very different. Remarkably, the tuning of the emission shade is not achieved at the expense of a significant reduction of the amount of emitted light. Indeed, although the extinction coefficient of the phosphor reduces by 60% from λ
 <sub>ex</sub> = 265 nm to λ
 <sub>ex</sub> = 320 nm, the total emitted light only diminishes by 15% when photoexciting at λ
 <sub>ex</sub> = 320 nm.

 </xref>c shows the time-dependent PL of the 
 <sup>4</sup>F
 <sub>9/2</sub> level of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and the 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> level of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> activators when they form an isolated film and when such films are stacked in a bilayer. Our results indicate that the structuring of the phosphors does not alter their dynamics, and the associated lifetimes are nearly identical. Indeed, the fitting of the decay curves yields the average lifetimes of 0.22 and 0.94 ms for Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, respectively. The QY of the Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> layer is ∼25%, whereas the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> film features an efficiency of ∼75%, which gives rise to QYs above 35% for the stack, as shown in
