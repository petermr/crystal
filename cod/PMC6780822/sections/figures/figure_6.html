 <caption> Relative angular luminance distribution of OLED devices with the implemented YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer versus the thickness of scattering layers, compared to the reference device and Lambertian distribution. The Lambertian distribution is plotted using scale-up to the same value of reference device at 0 degree for relative comparision. </caption>
