<p>This distinctive 1D material V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> could be used in optoelectronic devices because it can absorb photon energy without being disturbed by phonons. The charge mobility calculation of 1D V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> is needed to determine whether there are further applications for the field effect transistors that require a direct band gap and appropriately fast mobility, as with 2D MoS
 <sub>2</sub>.

 </sup> The spin property of this 1D material is also needed to be analyzed in future research. The 1D materials have higher surface-to-volume ratios and no dangling bonds, unlike the 2D materials; therefore, the 1D material V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> described in this study seems to be a promising material in nanoelectronics.
