<p>To perform a hopping event, a random number, 
 <italic>r</italic> (0 &lt; 
 <italic>r</italic> &lt; 1), is generated, and the adatom with a hopping probability closer to 
 <italic>r</italic>·
 <italic>K</italic> is chosen to hop, where 
 <italic>K</italic> is the cumulative sum of the hopping probabilities. Adatoms with a higher hopping rate have a higher probability of being chosen. After an adatom is selected, the 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>ES</sub> barrier determines the probability of diagonal movement. After each hop, the location of the adatoms in the (
 <italic>X</italic>, 
 <italic>Y</italic>, 
 <italic>Z</italic>) matrix is updated, and the hopping rates that may have changed and a new adatom is selected. The time of the simulation is updated after each hop using Δ
 <italic>t</italic> = −log(
 <italic>r</italic>)/
 <italic>K</italic>.

 </sup> Once a simulation time equal to 
 <italic>1/f</italic> has passed, where 
 <italic>f</italic> is the deposition frequency, a new pulse of the material arrives, and the simulation steps begin anew.
