<p id="Par17">White LEDs were fabricated with the cyan phosphor NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, the commercial yellow phosphor YAG:Ce, the commercial red phosphor KSF:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> and a blue LED InGaN chip (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 455 nm). The phosphors were thoroughly mixed with epoxy resin, and the obtained phosphor−epoxy resin mixture was coated on the LED chips. The photoelectric properties, including the emission spectra, CCT, color-rendering index (CRI, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>a</sub>), luminous efficacy, and CIE color coordinates of the LEDs, were measured by using an integrating sphere spectroradiometer system (ATA-1000, Ever fine).
