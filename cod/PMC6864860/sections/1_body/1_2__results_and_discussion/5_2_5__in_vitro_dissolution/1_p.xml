<p>The results of the dissolution tests are overlaid in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f008">Figure 8</xref>. All the co-crystal forms of PROG demonstrate some improvement in solubility and dissolution rate compared to untreated PROG. Among the three CCFs, only PROG-CNA and PROG-DOD have an obviously faster solubility rate in the first 1 h, and then the maximum concentrations are only slightly increased compared with PROG. However, PROG-CNA shows a significant increase and a faster rate. The maximum concentrations measured for PROG-CNA are almost double their PROG counterparts. In addition, the HPLC chromatograms show that the samples have maintained the same retain time peak as PROG before and after the dissolution study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f009">Figure 9</xref>). This may have a considerable impact on the bioavailability of PROG.
