<p id="Par18">The structure and composition of the chips were measured by microbeam XRD and XRF at a high-throughput X-ray set up on the Sector 33-ID-D of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, USA. The X-ray photon energy was tuned to 20 keV (λ = 0.062 nm). At an incident angle of 10 degrees, the beam was focused on the sample to a size of about 75 × 100 µm
 <sup>2</sup> by a pair of KB mirrors. A Newport 6-circle diffractometer was used to hold the sample and the detector. The chip was scanned with a step size of 360 µm in the longitudinal direction and 400 µm in the lateral direction with a total of 1,325 diffraction patterns recorded from the triangular region on each combinatorial chip. A Pilatus II-100k detector was mounted on the Del arm of the Newport at about 300 mm from the sample. For every spot on the sample, the diffraction signal was collected through a trajectory scan of Del’s arm from 10 to 50 degrees, which covered 2-theta from 7 to 57 degrees.
