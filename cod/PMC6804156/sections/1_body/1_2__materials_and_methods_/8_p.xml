<p>For thermal quenching (TQ) measurements a cryostat “MicrostatN” (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK) was used with above-described spectrometer. The sample was cooled by liquid nitrogen. The temperature-dependent emission spectra were measured at 77 K and at 100–500 K in 50 K intervals. The stabilization time for each temperature was 120 s and temperature tolerance was ±5 K. Dried nitrogen was flushed over the cryostat window during the measurements in order to prevent water condensation at low temperatures.</p>
