OA (1.0 mL) and OAm (1.0 mL) were injected into the flask, and after completely dissolving the salt mixture, the temperature was raised to 180 °C. The Cs-oleate precursor solution (0.8 mL) was swiftly injected into the reaction flask and then cooled in an ice water bath after 5 s. Crystallized nanoparticles were precipitated by adding
