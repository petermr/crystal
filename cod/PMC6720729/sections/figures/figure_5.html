 <caption> Angle-resolved photocurrent response of the photodetector based on 1T’-WTe 2. a) Real-time photocurrent response of different test angles (from 0° to 150°, spaced at 30° apart) under the following conditions: V ds = 5 mV, incident power = 1.4 mW, incident wavelength = 633 nm. b) The magnified photocurrent response of test angle at 60° with a response time of around 200 ms. c) Angle-resolved photosensitivity of the photodetector. </caption>
