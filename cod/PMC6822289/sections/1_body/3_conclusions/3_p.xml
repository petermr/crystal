<p>We plan to extend the same concept to other classes of materials, e.g., metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolites, aiming for an extensive database for adsorption properties, useful not only for comparison but also for training machine learning models that can later be used to prescreen new materials from quickly computed geometric properties. We will need to face more complex challenges, e.g., dealing with the DFT modeling of transition metals, or tuning the standard force fields to better describe the interaction with open metal sites in MOFs. In this perspective, AiiDA can serve as a common language for the whole scientific community to collaborate, systematically improving and recombining workchains that need to model more and more complex systems.</p>
