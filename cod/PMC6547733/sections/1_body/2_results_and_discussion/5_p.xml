<p id="Par14">A direct comparison of the overall interplay between structure, composition and electronic excitation concentration on transition temperature is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. For both 0.4% and 0.8% excitation concentration, the monoclinic compound made of 50% [Zr, Ti] mixing is found to be more resistant than cubic compound of the same composition. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> also shows that the variations of the transition temperature with Zr fraction are larger for the cubic phase than for the monoclinic phase. This behavior suggests that the introduction of Ti in the cubic LZO phase has a greater impact on its resistance than the introduction of Zr in the monoclinic LTO phase. Breaking the high symmetry of the cubic phase by mixing the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition has a more destabilizing effect than having a mixed 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition in the already low symmetry monoclinic phase. Interestingly, since the transition from monoclinic to cubic phase occurs at 53% Zr fraction, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows that the 50% [Zr, Ti] composition of the cubic lattice, which is the most vulnerable to electronic excitation, should not be involved. This has been symbolized by the black dashed lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Therefore, starting from a monoclinic layered perovskite LTO structure, the gradual substitution of Ti by Zr would yield structures that are increasingly more resistant to electronic excitations, with the cubic pyrochlore LZO being the most resistant to electronic excitation. This overall trend is in agreement with several experimental observations

 </sup>, which found that the susceptibility to amorphization by electronic excitation increases with cation radius ratio r
 <sub>A</sub>/r
 <sub>B</sub>. In the case of cubic LZO and monoclinic LTO, the r
 <sub>A</sub>/r
 <sub>B</sub> ratio is 1.61 and 1.92 respectively, making the LZO pyrochlore phase more resistant to electronic excitation. It is worth noting that the increase in electronic excitation resistance shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is not monotonic; a monoclinic compound with 50% Zr is predicted to have a similar transition temperature to a cubic compound with 75% Zr. While only the monoclinic and cubic phases were considered to model the phase transition between LTO and LZO, the potential for other phases to be involved in the transition region could lead to some uncertainty in the amorphization behavior in this regime. We also note that the trend in the resistance to electronic excitation follows the variations of the band gap (

 </sub>) of the materials, which increases with Zr fraction. While in each case the highest occupied orbitals are those of O 
 <italic>2p</italic>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(c)</xref> shows that the band gap reduction in cubic La
 <sub>2</sub>ZrTiO
 <sub>7</sub>, compared to cubic LZO, is essentially due to the presence of unoccupied Ti 
 <italic>3d</italic> states that have a lower energy than the unoccupied Zr 
 <italic>4d</italic> states. In contrast, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref> shows that the presence of 50% Zr in monoclinic Z-LTO crystal allows to reduce the number of lower energy Ti 
 <italic>3d</italic> unoccupied states, replacing them by higher energy Zr 
 <italic>4d</italic> unoccupied states. Altogether, the panel of projected density of states shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> indicates that the band gap of the monoclinic phase with 50% Zr (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>) is slightly larger than the band gap of the cubic phase with 50% Zr (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(c)</xref>), such that in order,

This correlation supports the idea that the radiation response cannot be solely described in terms of cation radius ratio and that other factors, such as defect formation energy, bond type (i.e. covalency and ionicity), electronic structure of the compounds, and energy of order-disorder transition, also play an important role in the amorphization resistance of ceramics to electronic excitation
