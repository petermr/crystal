<p id="Par28">Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed for the Pb 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and Nb 
 <italic>K</italic> edges at the NIST beamline 06-BM at NSLS-II (Brookhaven National Laboratory). The data were collected at room temperature in transmission. All the data were processed using Athena

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. For the Nb EXAFS, the 
 <italic>k</italic>-space data were multiplied by 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> prior to the Fourier transform, which was performed over the 
 <italic>k</italic>-range from 3.3 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> to 13.2 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>; the 
 <italic>r</italic>-space fitting range was from 1 Å to 4.2 Å, with both single- and multiple-scattering paths of a photoelectron included in the fit. For Pb, the 
 <italic>k</italic>-space data were multiplied by 
 <italic>k</italic> and the 
 <italic>k</italic>-space range used in the transform extended from 2.2 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>; the 
 <italic>r</italic>-space fit was performed from 1 Å to 3.5 Å, with only the single-scattering paths included.
