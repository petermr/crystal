 <caption> (A) Refined crystal structure of MgTa 2N 3; N, Mg, and Ta atoms are represented as orange, pink, and gray spheres. (B) Backscattered electron SEM micrograph of MgTa 2N 3 powder. (C) Characteristic EPS potential profile vs specific capacity (bottom axis) and vs moles of virtually extracted Mg 2+ (top axis), calculated considering that this is the only redox phenomenon taking place, for MgTa 2N 3 electrode (with 15% wt of Super P carbon) in Li cell, with 1 m LiBOB, EC/PC (1:1 vol) electrolyte at 100 Â°C and C/100 rate and corresponding ex situ X-ray powder diffraction patterns (D). Diffraction patterns of the pristine and chemically oxidized samples are also shown in (D) for comparison. </caption>
