<p>A single crystal of a suitable size was obtained by cutting down a selected large specimen to appropriate thickness. It was then placed in an Almax Plate Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) of the modified Merrill and Bassett design [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] together with a small piece of ruby, the latter serving as an internal pressure calibrant. The DAC was equipped with 0.75-mm culet diamonds and a steel gasket of an initial thickness of 0.3 mm and a 0.5-mm gasket hole. The DAC’s nominal maximal opening angle was 42
