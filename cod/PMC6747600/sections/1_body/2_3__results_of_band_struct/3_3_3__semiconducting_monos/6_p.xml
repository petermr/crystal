<p>Interesting results concerning the broadening of the dispersion lines due to the finite lifetime of coherent states connected with on-site correlations were obtained in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B87-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In the case of FeSi, the degree of incoherence increases with temperature, and the band gap decreases from 100 to 500 K, and then increases above 500 to 800 K. In contrast to FeSi, the degree of band-state incoherence in CoSi is small, in the range of Â±0.3 eV near the Fermi level, and decreases with the temperature [
 <xref rid="B87-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Thus, for CoSi, DFT seems to give quite accurate results. This conclusion was indirectly confirmed by the better agreement of the calculated lattice constants and bulk moduli for CoSi compared to other monosilicides of the fourth period.
