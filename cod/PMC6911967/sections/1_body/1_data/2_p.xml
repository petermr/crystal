<p id="p0030">The dataset contains the raw relaxed atomic coordinates and related calculated STM images for various Si(110) and Si(17 15 1) surface atomic models. Atomic structure relaxations were performed using the SIESTA code [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while the constant-current STM images were calculated using the WSxM software [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
