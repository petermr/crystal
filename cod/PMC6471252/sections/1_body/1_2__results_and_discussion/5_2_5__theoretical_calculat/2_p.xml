<p>The lattice-stabilizing energy decreased with increased pressure, becoming twice less negative at 4.4 GPa than at no external pressure. The most important in-stack interactions became less stabilizing fast, showing interaction energies of only âˆ’3.58 kJ/mol at 4.4 GPa (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01107-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The trend suggests that such an interaction would become repulsive at around 5 GPa.
