  <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> strain A134 was isolated from 
  <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> colonies collected from Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel. The 
  <italic>Aeromonas</italic> culture media inhibited the growth of 
  <italic>M. aeruginosa</italic> (strain MGK). The crude extract of a large-scale culture of 
  <italic>A. veronii</italic> A134 was separated in a few chromatographic steps to yield three new secondary metabolites, 9-chlorolumichrome (
  <bold>1</bold>), veronimide (
  <bold>2</bold>) and veronipyrazine (
  <bold>3</bold>), along with a known lumichrome and several known diketopiperazines. The structures of the new compounds were established by analyses of the data from 1D and 2D NMR experiments and HRMS data of the compounds, as well as a single-crystal X-ray analysis of synthetic 
  <bold>1</bold>. The structure elucidation and proposed biogenesis of the new compounds are described below.
