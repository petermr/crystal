 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f010">Figure 10</xref> shows the average friction forces of textured surfaces with different orientations. For the orientations of 0째 and 90째, the average friction forces are greatly higher than the other cases. The case of 0째 orientation presents the highest average friction force, and the average friction force of 45째 orientation shows the minimum value.
