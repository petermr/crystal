<p id="Par34">Implantation was performed at the National Ion Beam Centre, University of Surrey, UK. The sample was partly implanted with helium at 298 K, using a 2 MeV ion accelerator, and a raster scanned beam, to ensure a uniform implantation dose. Using a combination of different ion energies and fluences (Appendix D in Supplementary Material), a near uniform helium ion concentration of ~3000 appm within a ~2.8 µm thick implanted layer was obtained

 </sup>) is shown in Appendix D. A helium ion concentration of ~3100 ± 410 appm, with an associated damage of 0.20 ± 0.03 displacements per atom (dpa) was obtained between 0–2.8 µm depth. Frenkel pair formation is the main damage mechanism, since helium implantation induced recoils at energies &lt;2 MeV have predominantly low energy
