<p>The change of each component of the structure will influence the properties. For example, the selection of cations is an important factor affecting the lattice orientation of inorganic layers and the number of inorganic layers is related to the reaction stoichiometric ratio. All these factors will change the physical and optical properties of 2D perovskites.</p>
