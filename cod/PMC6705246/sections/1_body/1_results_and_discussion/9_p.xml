<p>Finally, we compared the as-prepared BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors with several reported Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>-activated perovskite-type red-emitting phosphors. Their host materials, optimal Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> doping concentrations, PL and PLE peaks, and IQEs are shown in

  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>. It can be seen that BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors had a higher IQE and better PL properties than other phosphors. These results further demonstrated that the as-prepared BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors with outstanding optical properties could be applied in plant growth LEDs.
