<p>The ten data sets belonging to the largest cluster were merged using XSCALE
 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> and structure refinement was initiated using the lattice parameters obtained from the XRPD data, reasoning that these would be more accurate than those obtained from ED data. Indeed, this immediately resulted in more reasonable average Si−O bond lengths. Restraints on the Si−O distances and O‐Si‐O angles were not necessary. The atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) for all framework atoms were refined anisotropically. In the final stages of the refinement, the SWAT instruction was introduced to model the diffuse species in the channels (such as, the SDA, residual water, Na
 <sup>+</sup>). This instruction suppresses the contribution from the strong, low‐angle reflections where the contribution of extra‐framework species is strongest. This significantly reduced the 
 <italic>R</italic>1 value, and resulted in more meaningful shapes for the ADPs (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> b,c). The refinement of the framework structure of SSZ‐27 converged with 
 <italic>R1</italic>=0.178, 
 <italic>wR2</italic>=0.486, and 
 <italic>S</italic>=1.47 (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> b). Crystallographic details and the geometry of the zeolite framework are summarized in the Supporting information (Tables S6–S8).
