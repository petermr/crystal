<p>The intense, sharp N–H ν band of H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 between 3320 and 3350 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> reduced its intensity after Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> coordination and became broad by the formation of the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complexes even to overlap the C–H ν band at 2930–2945 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The broadening of these bands and the appearance of an additional broad band around 3300–3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> or an even smaller wavenumber are attributable to the presence of water molecules and the consequent hydrogen bonding. The sharp C=O ν band of amide I (at 1644 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 receptor in Raman spectra was slightly weakened in the Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> complex, and additionally broadened in the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complexes, as a consequence of the participation of amides in the coordination of the metals to the receptor.
