<p id="Par18">Our observations imply a possible formation of a very complex network of polyhedra, including face-shared octahedra in silicate liquids at high pressures. A possible influence of such structural peculiarities on the elastic properties of silica (and indirectly on silicate melts) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>) may be assessed through a comparison of the compressibility and bulk sound velocities of coesite-IV and coesite-V with those of dense silica phases with hexa-coordinated silicon (stishovite, CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>-structured SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and seifertite)

 </sup>. Obviously, the presence of unconventional structural elements like SiO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra and face-sharing octahedra significantly decreases density and, what is even more important, it leads to a drop in the bulk sound velocity above 40 GPa (by about 10% compared with high-pressure crystalline SiO
 <sub>2</sub> phases; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9c</xref>). If silicate liquids with such properties are present in the lower mantle, they should be clearly seismically detectable.
