<p>The fast decomposition of the oxohydroxoferrates impedes the magnetic measurements. Even washing results in a minor amount of amorphous iron oxide, which has a very large magnetic moment in comparison to the oxohydroxoferrates. Therefore, we prepared the samples for magnetic measurements directly out of the vacuum‐dried hydroflux for each compound, which means, without removing the alkali metal hydroxides. The amounts of the bases were determined by titration experiments and resulted in approximate oxohydroxoferrate contents between 10 and 20 %.</p>
