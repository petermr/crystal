<p>Cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals have been by far the most common QD materials for the emission in the visible spectral range, spanning it from the blue (CdS) to cyan, green, yellow, orange, and red (CdSe), and extending further into the deep red for CdTe.

 <sub>2</sub> for the visible spectral range.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> For II‐VI QDs, high PL QYs often become accessible with the growth of an epitaxial inorganic shell, leading to the formation of so‐called Type I core/shell particles. Depending on the band gap alignment of these materials, such heterostructures are commonly denoted as Type I or Type II.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Type I band alignment describes a core/shell system where the band gap of the core is smaller than the band gap of the shell material, and both the conduction and the valence band edges are higher/lower for the shell material as compared for the core material. A typical example for the Type I core/shell QDs are CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals, where the shell keeps excitons in the core and at the same time efficiently passivates surface traps, which results in enhanced stability and high PL QYs (see inset in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). While PL QY is one of the main factors for the QDs used for down‐conversion, the spectral linewidths of the emission peak, measured as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), is equally important for display applications. Narrow emission peaks indicate good size homogeneity in an ensemble of QDs and ensure high color purity of the emitters, translating into a wide range of accessible, vivid colors for the devices employing red‐green‐blue (RGB) mixed colors.
