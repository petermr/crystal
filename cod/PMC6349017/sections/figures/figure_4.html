 <caption> Calculated proton transfer free-energy landscapes (PTFELs) at T = 300 K and schematic structures for the surface-PT and adlayer-PT coordinates at the (a) ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and (b and c) ZnO(112[combining macron]0) interfaces in the presence of liquid water (only the species participating in PT are shown). The numbers given in the PTFELs are the corresponding PT barriers in units of k B T. For ZnO(112[combining macron]0) (b and c), proton hole centers (PHCs) are transferred within the same surface “row” (intra), or between two adjacent surface rows (inter); the gray lines connect atoms within the same surface row. In (b), the left and right hand sides of the adlayer-PT coordinates are different because of the polar crystal direction in the substrate. </caption>
