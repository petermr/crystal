<p>Three-dimensional photoemission recording has been implemented two decades ago in photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) with ToF-analysis, by adding a low-energy drift space and an (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb63"> ▸</xref>). Angle-resolving ToF instruments as described by Ovsyannikov 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb55"> ▸</xref>) and Berntsen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2011
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> ▸</xref>) are based on electron-lens systems similar to those used in hemispherical analyzers, complemented by the same combination of drift section and DLD. ToF-ARPES instruments record a circular cone of emission angles and an energy interval of several eV simultaneously. This concept is similar to the 
 <italic>k</italic>-microscope described in the present work. For photoelectrons with low kinetic energies and a moderate angular range (as accepted by the lens) the recording efficiency of ToF-ARPES instruments and the present microscope are identical. As long as both stay in the parameter window of 100% transmission, the total efficiency is just given by the detection sensitivity of the DLD. The recording schemes (polar coordinates in ToF-ARPES versus direct 
 <italic>k</italic>-imaging) differ just by a simple transformation.
