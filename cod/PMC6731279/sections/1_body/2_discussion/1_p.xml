<p id="Par15">The present study demonstrates that a robust EG can be generated at the heterointerface of an epitaxially grown CHO film and a STO substrate with either termination. This EG is distinctly different from that of LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub>/T-STO because it is insensitive to the termination of STO, has no strict critical thickness of CHO, and is stable against polar adsorbates. This EG is also remarkably stable against annealing in oxygen, comparable with that of LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub>/T-STO. Using this EG as the conducting channel, and CHO as gating dielectrics, FETs are constructed. The high-performance gating ability, integrated with the robustness to environments (temperature, oxygen, humidity, and solvents), makes the EG at the interfaces of CHO/STO very attractive for applications in oxide electronics.
