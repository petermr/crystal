<p>The thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs) of the metal complexes were carried out with a Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1 TGA apparatus at a heating rate of 5 °C/min for CuL14 and MnL14, and 2.5 °C/min for FeL14 in a temperature range of 25 to 800 °C under an O
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Spectrum evaluations were performed using the Pyris version 11.1.1.0492 software package.
