<p>According to the energy computed here for Anh‐B (Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and combining with those computed by Hernández et al. (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) using the same set of pseudo potentials, we verified that above 14 GPa, the mixture Anh‐B + stishovite is indeed a little bit more stable than forsterite but less stable than wadsleyite. Ganguly and Frost (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) have also calculated the possible reactions (Fo/Wads/Ring) = Anh‐B + Stishovite. They show that at 1400 °C, the formation of Anh‐B is indeed not expected. To grow Anh‐B, Kojitani et al. (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and Yuan et al. (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) started from mixtures having the stoichiometric composition of Anh‐B. Alternatively, Anh‐B has first been reported by Herzberg and Gasparik (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>) from melting experiments at 16.5 GPa on chondritic material, and in the run product of melting experiments of forsterite at 16.5 GPa, 2380°C (Presnall &amp; Gasparik, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the only report for direct formation of Anh‐B from stoichiometric olivine composition has been done by Hazen et al. (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>) in a Fe‐bearing system (Fo80). The unexpected stability of Anh‐B was attributed to the presence of Fe.
