<p>From the references above, the textured surfaces or the surface defects influence the friction behaviors greatly, while the effects of the subsurface defects on friction properties are still unknown. Besides, the detailed influence of the texture parameters on the friction process needs further study. Therefore, in this paper, textured surfaces with different depths, widths, orientations, and shapes are modeled, and the friction behaviors between a rigid cylindrical tip and the textured surfaces are investigated. Furthermore, the influence of subsurface defects in the substrate is also discussed.</p>
