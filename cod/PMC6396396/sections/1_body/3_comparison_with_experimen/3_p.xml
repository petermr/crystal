<p>The Al/Si ordering in superspace of M25 #1 was also determined and implemented for more accurate calculations in the range 0 &lt; 
 <italic>x</italic> &lt; 1/3, which are labelled AS2. This Al/Si ordering scheme is not applicable for 
 <italic>x</italic> &gt; 1/3 as described in Section 3.2
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.2"/>. However, the qualitative difference between M25 #1 (AS2) and M25 #2 (AS1) is the orientation of Al–Si diclusters at the borders between vacancy blocks and vacancy-free blocks. This orientation scheme can be implemented in supercells with 
 <italic>x</italic> &gt; 1/3 by adapting the orientation of respective diclusters and triclusters (AS3). Geometrically optimized structural models of M25 (AS1, AS2) and M43 (AS1, AS3) are shown in Fig. 9
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"> ▸</xref> and of M50 (AS3) in the supporting information.
