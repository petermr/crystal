  <p>Emission mechanism of the wind‐driven TIEL. a) Schematic diagrams displaying the generation of electricity by the TIEL material resulted from the wind flutter vibration. b) Serial photos showing four vibration states of an oscillating ZnS:Cu film. c) Variant vibration modes of the ZnS:Cu film simulated by ANSYS. d) COMSOL simulation of displacement distribution of the ZnS:Cu film at wind speeds of 5, 10, and 15 m s
   <sup>−1</sup>. e) Lateral electric potential distribution simulated by COMSOL at wind speeds of 0, 5, 10, and 15 m s
   <sup>−1</sup>. f) Corresponding electrical potential distribution and g) electric field on the ZnS:Cu film along the dashed line defined in inset (f) at wind speeds of 0, 5, 10, and 15 m s
   <sup>−1</sup>. h) Lateral electric potential distribution in an intact contact‐separation cycle under four states at a wind speed of 10 m s
   <sup>−1</sup>. i) Corresponding electric potential distribution along the dashed lines defined in the inset that shows the electric potential difference.
