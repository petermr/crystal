<p id="Par23">Thus, the momentum resolved photoemission experiment indicates a considerable modification of the electronic structure of both, the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub>(0001) surface and of the BiI
 <sub>3</sub>-film. At first view this comes as a surprise given the rather weak structural modification of the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub>(0001) surface, but recent theoretical studies have predicted the appearance of interface states even in vdW epitaxial interfaces
