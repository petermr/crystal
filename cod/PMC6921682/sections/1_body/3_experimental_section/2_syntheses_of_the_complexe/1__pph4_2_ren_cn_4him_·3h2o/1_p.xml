 <bold>Method 1</bold>: Him (212 mg, 3.12 mmol) and 
 <bold>1</bold> (121 mg, 0.123 mmol) were dissolved in 2 mL hot water. The solution was cooled to room temperature to give yellow crystals. The crystals were washed with cold water and dried under vacuum. Yield: 122 mg (91.2%). Anal. Calcd for C
