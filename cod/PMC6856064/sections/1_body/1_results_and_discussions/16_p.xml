<p id="Par18">The CVGs and the local Chroma shift of the PKG-1-1UV2B-GR and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LEDs are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The local Chroma shifts for these LEDs are under 7%, mostly positive shifts. The D
 <sub>uv</sub> values are −0.0061 and −0.0050 for PKG-1-1UV2B-GR and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LEDs, respectively indicating that these light sources will be highly preferred.
