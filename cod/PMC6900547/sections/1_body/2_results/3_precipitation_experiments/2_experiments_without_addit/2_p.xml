<p>A white precipitate was observed to form within 3 min after the Li-bearing and carbonate solutions were mixed. XRD identified the precipitates as zabuyelite, and DRIFTS analysis of the bulk precipitate (

 </xref>a) confirmed that our precipitates were consistent with zabuyelite precipitated using LiCl.

 </sup> SEM images of the precipitates show that the crystals formed a consistently prismatic morphology (average length: 9 μm) with one elongated axis (

 </xref>a), in agreement with previous synthesis experiments.

 </sup> One terminus of the elongation axis was observed to have a rough appearance. Closer inspection of the images revealed that this is probably related to the formation of rosettes, where the center of the rosette is hollow, and crystals show a similar texture at their terminus. Raman spectroscopy of single crystals confirmed the identification of zabuyelite through the characteristic carbonate symmetrical stretching band at 1093 cm
