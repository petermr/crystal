<p id="p0160">The descent of the TG curves of the both NCN0.25 and NCN0.55 samples proceeded in several steps. Their limits were defined from the derivatives and marked with numbers (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>), allowing for the accurate evaluation of the step heights. The limit 1 at 313 K (40 °C) defines the beginning of the dehydration, which ends at 677 K (limit 5) for NCN0.25 and at 673 K (limit 6) for NCN0.55 (i.e. at ca. 400 °C for both). The three intermediate limits are located at 405, 464 and 548 K and separate four steps of weight loss. The first of them occurs at 382 K for NCN0.25 and at 374 K for NCN0.55, constituting 0.5 and 0.4%, respectively. The second one occurs at the same temperature of 423 K for the both samples, increasing the difference in weight loss from 0.1 to 0.4%. Next, NCN0.25 looses the rest 1.3% in one step at characteristic temperature of 537 K, while NCN0.55 proceeds in two steps of 517 and 573 K, decreasing for 0.4%. The final weight of NCN0.25 accounts for 97.7% of initial weight, while that of NCN0.55 is reduced to 98.9%. The overall weight loss for NCN0.55 is two times lower than that for NCN0.25 being in accordance to what had been observed with XRD and FT-IR techniques earlier.
