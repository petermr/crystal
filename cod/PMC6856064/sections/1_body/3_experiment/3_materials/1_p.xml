<p id="Par25">The yellow phosphor used in this study is commercial YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor. The green and red phosphors are GNYAG3757 and R6634 developed by Intematix. In the 1B-GR LED package, the optimized ratio of green and red phosphors was 14% and 2.7%. In the 1B-BYR LED package, the ratio of blue, yellow, and red phosphors were 4%, 6%, and 2.3%, respectively. Two blue LED chips were used in the study, with the peak emission wavelengths around 452 and 455 nm. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the various chips analyzed for the present study. PKGs were fabricated using the chips to achieve the required CRI. After careful evaluation, Corp.C’s 2140 chip was used to make 1UV2B-GR LEDs.
