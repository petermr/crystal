<p>At zero pressure, the density of the localized electrons along the Ge–Se–I bond is steady, and the value of the ELF along bond I is approximately 0.4, which suggests that bond I forms a covalent bond. The blue region along the long Ge–Se–III bond indicates low density of the localized electrons, which demonstrates that the covalent bond fails to form because there are almost no valence electrons in the long Ge–Se pairs. The hydrostatic pressure slightly changes bond I and it significantly compresses bond III as noted above, driving the phase transition. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f006">Figure 6</xref>b, at high pressure, there are four equivalent Ge–Se pairs in a layer. The atomic structure model illustrates the fact that the four bonds have the same bond length. The ELF profile also shows the density of the localized electrons, which are uniformly distributed between Ge–Se bonds. Furthermore, compared with the profile of the ELF between the paired Ge–Se atoms in bond I under different pressures, the hydrostatic pressure slightly reduces the density of the localized electrons between the paired Ge–Se atoms.
