<p>Finally, we comment on the magnitudes of the calculated diffusion coefficients. Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are particularly pronounced for light elements like H, and have been shown to lower the proton transfer barriers of, for example, H

It is not unreasonable to assume that similar considerations of NQEs would lead also to greater diffusion coefficients of the PHCs on the nonpolar ZnO surfaces. Although NQEs may affect the PT barriers, and, consequently, the PT rates and diffusion coefficients, they would not necessarily affect the relative diffusion coefficients along the polar and nonpolar crystal directions. An explicit treatment of NQEs lies outside the scope of the current work, but would give a more quantitatively accurate picture of the pertinent diffusion coefficients.
