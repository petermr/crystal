 </sup> we demonstrate a novel route toward efficient production of red phosphors for LEDs. By a high-gravity-assisted process intensification method to achieve uniform Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> doping in GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> particles at mesoscale, the reaction time for the preparation of the precursor was reduced from 2 h in STR to 20 min in RPB. The product of red phosphors with luminescence quantum yield of up to 78.11% was obtained and makes one of the best red phosphors. The GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors synthesized by high-gravity-assisted methods also show excellent thermal stability at 423 K, maintaining 98% of luminescent intensity at room temperature. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of the as-synthesized GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor were determined to be (0.598, 0.341), and primary applications of these phosphors for NUV LEDs were demonstrated. These studied illustrated that high-gravity-assisted approaches are promising for tuning the doping of rare-earth ions in microparticles at mesoscale toward efficient production of phosphors.
