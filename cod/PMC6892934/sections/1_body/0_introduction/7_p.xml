<p id="Par8">We hypothesize that initially He
 <sub>2</sub>V-SIA defect complexes can strongly obstruct dislocation motion owing to the strong binding energy of the di-helium-vacancy complex of ~3.1â€‰eV (which makes it difficult to cut through the He
 <sub>2</sub>V-SIA obstacle)

 </sup>. However, as deformation progresses, we propose that there comes a stage when gliding dislocations can exert sufficient force on He
 <sub>2</sub>V-SIA pinning obstacles to dissociate the helium from the helium-vacancy complex. The SIA component of the defect complex may then quickly jump into the vacancy, annihilating the Frenkel-pair which was retained by the helium. This defect removal would facilitate easier glide of subsequent dislocations through defect-free channels and lead to the slip step formation seen near nano-indents in helium-implanted tungsten, as mobile dislocations exit at the free surface
