 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, where the SOFs of Ag (4a), In (4b) and Te (8d) are all 1.0 in AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> without the antisite defect In
 <sub>Ag</sub> identified. In addition, the main peaks of the patterns are indexed to the existing chalcopyrite AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> (PDF: 65–0355) with the minor impurities AgTe
 <sub>3</sub> (1.3 wt.% at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0) and Te (less than 3.1 wt.% at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0, 0.15, 0.2) precipitated. In order to prevent the precipitation of the impurities AgTe
 <sub>3</sub> and Te from the main phase AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub>, all the samples were subject to heat treatment at 813 K for 72 h. After the heat treatment, the materials were purified without any impurity phases in the samples at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0–0.1, and only trace Te element still exists in the samples at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.15 and 0.2, as shown in the refined XRD patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>. The crystallographic data, Wyckoff positions, atomic coordinates and site occupancy factors (SOFs) in the heat-treated samples are not shown here.
