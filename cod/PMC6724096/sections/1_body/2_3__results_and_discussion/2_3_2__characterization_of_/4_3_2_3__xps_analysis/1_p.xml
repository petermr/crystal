<p>XRD and Raman analysis did not find the specific existence state of iron, but both showed evidence of the existence of iron. Therefore, the synthesized Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was analyzed by XPS to determine the specific existence of iron. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the full XPS spectrum of 5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and the high-resolution spectra of Ti2p, O1s and Fe2p. All electron binding energies were calibrated according to C1s (284.6 eV) of contaminated carbon. The full spectrum of 5.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f006">Figure 6</xref>a; the main elements are Ti and O, and there are relatively few Fe elements in the sample, meaning that the detected signal of the Fe element is relatively weak. The peaks at 458.7 eV and 464.5 eV correspond to the Ti2p characteristic peaks of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. The peaks at 529.9 eV and 531.5 eV correspond to the characteristic peaks of O1s in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f006">Figure 6</xref>d shows less obvious Fe2p characteristic peaks than
