 <caption> Mapping of peak position measured in high-throughput XRD experiments ( a) as-deposited, ( b) annealed at 373 K for 110 h, ( c) the mapping of FWHM(sigma) of the peak as-deposited, ( d) the mapping of FWHM of the peak annealed at 373 K for 110 h, ( e) the XRD pattern following the red arrow at as-deposited state and ( f) the XRD pattern of annealed at 373 K for 110 h ( A is chosen to be the boundary between amorphous and crystalline structure). </caption>
