<p id="Par36">Distortions of the oxygen octahedral framework from an ideal configuration were characterized by introducing a set of deformation modes for the oxygen octahedra. For a more intuitive interpretation, the modes were selected to mimic both typical lattice distortions (e.g., tetragonal, orthorhombic) and vibrational modes (rotations, bending) while providing a complete orthonormal basis. The resulting modes are depicted in Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. All the modes, except for the tetragonal, preserve an octahedron’s volume. The orthorhombic and rotational modes describe oxygen coordinates adequately within the limits of the small-angle (linear) approximation.
