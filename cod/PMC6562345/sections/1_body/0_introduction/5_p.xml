<p>One common trend in hybrid perovskites with disordered 
 <bold>A</bold>-site guests is that the decrease in void space with pressure causes these cations to freeze into an ordered configuration; this has now been established in both halide [
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and formate perovskites [
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Here, we consider instead a family of materials, the metal guanidinium formates, in which the 
 <bold>A</bold>-site guests are ordered under ambient conditions. We report single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction, powder neutron diffraction and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on these compounds under pressure. Our results demonstrate that the phase diagrams of these materials are dictated by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the guanidinium and formate ions, with implications for crystal engineering of the hybrid perovskites more generally.
