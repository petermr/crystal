<p id="Par12">Our calculations show that not only the net spin polarization, but also the local spin polarizations of Ga and As atoms for these two single degenerate bands vanish. This can be understood by symmetry arguments. The site symmetry groups of Ga and As atoms are 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> and the little group of Î› line is 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3v</sub>, which is a subgroup of 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>. The magnetization of Ga and As atoms must satisfy the symmetry of 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3v</sub> which is a non-pseudo-polar point group.
