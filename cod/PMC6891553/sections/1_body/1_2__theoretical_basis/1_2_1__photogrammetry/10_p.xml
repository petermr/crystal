<p>(iii) Generation of a scattered three-dimensional points cloud: This phase is usually called bundle adjustment [
 <xref rid="B34-sensors-19-04881" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], where the first ground coordinates are obtained from the intersections of the straight lines of each frame of a series of dispersed points of the photographed object. To do this, block adjustment of the coordinates of the centers of each camera, the control points, and those defined for the scattered cloud is carried out.
