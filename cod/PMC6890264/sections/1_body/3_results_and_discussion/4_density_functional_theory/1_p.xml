<p>To corroborate our assumption of weaker Ga–P bond strengths in GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP with respect to GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, we conducted DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p);Ga:SDD level to estimate both the ground-state geometry of the complexes and the Ga–P bond enthalpy. In the DFT calculations, we modeled TOP as triethylphosphine to avoid an extensive conformational search due to the many degrees of freedom of the long alkyl chains. We expect that only the first few CH
 <sub>2</sub> groups of TOP significantly influence the Ga–P bond, making PEt
 <sub>3</sub> an acceptable surrogate for TOP. To verify whether the outcome of these calculations is physically reasonable, we compare calculated geometries to experimental structures obtained from X-ray crystallography. We include an additional complex (GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–PPh
 <sub>3</sub>), as, to the best of our knowledge, the structures of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP have not been resolved experimentally. The results of the DFT calculations (Ga–P bond lengths and dissociation enthalpies) and the experimentally determined Ga–P bond lengths are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>. The Ga–P bond lengths determined by DFT deviate from the experimental ones by only 4–5%. Moreover, the DFT results reproduce the experimental trend in Ga–P bond length from GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–PEt
 <sub>3</sub> to GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–PPh
 <sub>3</sub>. Thus, although the absolute values obtained from the DFT calculations are 4–5% longer than the experimental ones, the trends in the DFT results are reliable. We observe that, with increasing electron-withdrawing nature of the side groups on the phosphine ligand, the Ga–P bond length

 <sub>3</sub>–DPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP are weaker than those in GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP.
