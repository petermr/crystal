 </sup> on cuprates forming over certain homogeneity ranges showed that the presence and, furthermore, temperatures of metal-to-superconductor transitions are linked to the amounts of oxygen vacancies in the crystal structures. Another series of superconductors, which form over certain homogeneity ranges, has been identified for chalcogenides crystallizing with the rock salt-type structure.

 </sup> More recent research

 </sup> on the electronic band structures of such rock salt-type chalcogenides based on initial, defect-free structure models revealed that flat bands were located near, but not at the Fermi levels in several of these compounds. In the flat band/steep band scenario,

 </sup> results. This apparent discrepancy was explained by additional investigations showing that the locations of flat bands relative to the Fermi levels ought to be manipulated by the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of these chalcogenides. But, what are the driving forces to crystallize with compositions that are related to vacancies in the crystal structures of the respective rock salt-type chalcogenides? To answer this question, we sought to investigate the electronic as well as vibrational properties, and the nature of bonding for a series of prototypical chalcogenide superconductors, i.e., MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu). In this contribution, we present the results of our explorations.
