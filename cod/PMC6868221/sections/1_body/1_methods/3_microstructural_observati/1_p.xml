<p id="Par17">Detailed microstructural observations were conducted using TEM, JEOL JEOM-2100F, at the center and edge of the disk processed by HPT for 100 turns. The TEM specimens were prepared using a focused ion beam, FEI Quanta 3D FEG, where the samples were taken at the disk center at 
 <italic>r</italic> ≈ 0 mm and at the disk edge at 
 <italic>r</italic> ≈ 4.0 mm, respectively, where 
 <italic>r</italic> is the radius of the disk. High-resolution compositional analysis was conducted using energy dispersive spectroscopy in a scanning TEM mode.
