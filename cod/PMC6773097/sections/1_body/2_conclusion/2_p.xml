<p>At the same time, developments in electron diffraction methodology, both hardware and software, have reached a point where high‐quality data can be collected routinely on a large number of crystals. As the XRPD data were insufficient for structure refinement, ED data were collected on eighteen crystals, four of which belonged to an SSZ‐26 impurity phase, corroborating our conclusions from the molecular modelling studies that SSZ‐26 forms equally well using all three isomers. The other fourteen crystals belonged to the SSZ‐27 phase. Key to this study is the application of hierarchical cluster analysis that leads to an optimal selection of data sets for structure refinement. This, in turn, helps to obtain more reliable and precise atomic coordinates of the framework, but also to get a handle on the atomic displacements of the atoms. The fact that physically meaningful atomic displacement parameters can be obtained from submicron‐sized crystals opens up new possibilities for studying atomic motion (e.g. internal vibrations) and disorder (static or dynamic). The framework structure that emerged for SSZ‐27 is that of a small‐pore zeolite with a one‐dimensional channel system connecting heart‐shaped cavities with smaller cavities through 8‐rings. Through molecular modelling, we were able to establish that the SDA is located exclusively in the heart‐shaped cavity. It is assumed that the other cavity contains water.</p>
