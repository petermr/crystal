<p>To predict the room-temperature electrochemical behavior, we analyzed the electronic structure of Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> in the paramagnetic state. From the ionic picture, because of the nonclosed shell configuration of the valence electrons (3 × Co − 3

 <sup>7</sup> + 2 × Sn − 5
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> + 2 × S − 3

 <sup>4</sup>), a metallic nature is expected in this compound. The charge-carrier density is determined to be around 1.22 × 10
 <sup>21</sup> cm
 <sup>−3</sup>, showing the semimetallic characteristics. We show that the band structure in the paramagnetic state without spin-orbital coupling (SOC), as depicted in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, shows the electronic band structure without inclusion of SOC. Because of the crystal mirror symmetry, the band inversion induced the linear crossing near the Fermi energy can be found around the L point of the BZ, which is consistent with the reported Weyl semimetal state in ferromagnetic Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> (

 </xref>). These nodal lines are gapped everywhere by SOC, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S1, allowing to define a Z
 <sub>2</sub> invariances. As given in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, a nonzero Z
 <sub>2</sub> of (1; 000) can be found in Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> if the Fermi level is located within the band gap exactly. Subsequently, we investigated the surface band structure with Sn and S terminations. 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> shows the nontrivial surface states on the (001) facet for Sn termination, as calculated by using Green’s function based on the tight-binding Hamiltonian. Nontrivial surface states can be observed but are difficult to distinguish because of the weak SOC effect. With increasing strength of the SOC, the upper surface states become nontrivial here (fig. S2, surface states with 2SOC and 3SOC). Furthermore, we calculated the contribution of the Co (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), Sn, and S atoms (fig. S3) to the nontrivial surface states (surface states with S and Sn) and found that almost all of the surface states are derived from the Co atoms. The same results were obtained when exposing the S layer (fig. S4). Further orbital analysis indicated that almost all of these surface states are almost from the Co 
 <italic>d</italic> orbital. These TSSs are unoccupied and located only 0.23 eV above the Fermi level, in addition to being nontrivial and robustness against static perturbations that preserve the relevant symmetries. Last, we calculated the decay depth of the surface states, which is estimated to be approximately 30 unit cells in the bulk. All these observations suggest that Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> is the ideal candidate to be used for exploring the electron transfer kinetics in the water oxidation process.
