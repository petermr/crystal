<p>The structure and associated mutational analysis of a member of the 2′-dG-II class of purine riboswitches in complex with 2′-deoxyguanosine has yielded new insights into how modification of similar RNA sequences can potentially alter selectivity to bind alternative small molecules. The 2′-dG-II riboswitch aptamer domain shares significant sequence and structural homology with other members of the purine riboswitch family in regions critical for establishing global 3D architecture and ligand recognition. Compared to the guanine/adenine class, both classes of 2′-dG binding riboswitches use similar changes in sequence and architecture in J2/3 to accommodate the 2′-deoxyribose sugar: a shift of the pyrimidine residue that contacts the sugar edge of the ligand nucleobase in all purine riboswitches and flipping out of three nucleotides from J2/3. This five nucleotide element (
 <italic>xpt</italic> and 
 <italic>env1</italic> nucleotides 47–51) is critical for conferring 2′-dG selectivity. A single point mutation, U51C, in the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch is sufficient to switch the ligand preference from guanine to 2′-dG, and additional changes within this element further enhance 2′-dG selectivity and affinity.
