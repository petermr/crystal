<p>In an ideal lattice, atoms are located strictly regularly and periodically. In an actual lattice, due to the formation conditions of crystals, the thermal movement of atoms, or other reasons, there are some defects in crystals, and the symmetry of the lattice is not perfect, which changes the mechanical properties of the material. Besides, the defects can be produced during the sliding process, and produce a noticeable contribution to the friction [
