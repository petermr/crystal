 </sup>. An integrating sphere (Labsphere QE sphere) was connected with a PL spectrometer (Ocean Optics QEpro) by an optical fiber. A continuous wave 403 nm laser was used to excite the sample. The incident laser intensity was changed by neutral density filters and the intensity was measured by a power meter (Newport 843R). The samples for PLQE measurement were encapsulated and the measurement was performed in air at room temperature. The PLQE results were confirmed by our collaborator at Xi’an Jiao Tong University (Supplementary Fig.

The Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer has an integrating sphere with a diameter of 150 mm. The excitation light was a monochromatic 365 nm light and the intensity is 0.5 mW cm
