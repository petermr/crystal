<p id="Par48">On the other hand, 2D-SAROM needs separate rows on the spectroscopic CCD for the registration of Raman signals from differently polarized laser beams. In the case of 3D orientation measurements in 2D-SAROM configuration, the diffraction limited laser points become blurred and overlapped, due to reflection index-caused aberrations when the laser is focused in the depth of the material

 </sup>. Therefore, for the 3D orientation mapping of polycrystalline sapphire we decided to use 3D-SAROM configuration. In such a way, the responses from differently polarized laser spots become non-overlapped on spectroscopic CCD.
