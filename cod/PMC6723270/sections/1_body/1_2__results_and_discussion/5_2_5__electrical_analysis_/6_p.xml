<p>The values for the relaxation time are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The increase in relaxation time with temperature is consistent with the decrease of the resistance at “bulk process”, most likely due to higher K–O bond distances in Mn8, as was observed by the Rietveld refinement (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This relaxation time was almost linear with respect to the temperature for Mn8, but it decreased nearly exponentially for Mn4. This suggests that the relaxation time in the “bulk” is thermally activated and is lower for Mn4, indicating a fast electron mobility correlated to a high surface area and low crystal size (
