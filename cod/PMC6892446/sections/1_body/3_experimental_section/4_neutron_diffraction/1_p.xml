<p>The characterization of the magnetic properties of

  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> was carried out on the SPODI high‐resolution powder diffractometer at the research reactor Heinz Maier‐Leibnitz in Munich (FRM II). Diffraction data were collected at 4 K and 300 K using a closed‐cycle cryostat and a Ge(551) monochromator with a neutron wavelength of 
 <italic>λ</italic>=154.83 pm and a step width of 0.05°. The detector bank consists of 80 spatially resolved 
 <sup>3</sup>He counter tubes (active measuring height: 300 mm; 2° angular range).
