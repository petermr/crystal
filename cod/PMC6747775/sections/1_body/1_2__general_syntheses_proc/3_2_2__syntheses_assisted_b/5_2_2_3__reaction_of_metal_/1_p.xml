<p>Another disadvantage of the reaction of metal hydrides and aluminum salts is the loss in hydrogen capacity. This is the result of the formation of salts, such as LiCl, NaCl, or MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, which usually are not separated from the products. Alternatively, to avoid the formation of these salts, a reaction of a metal hydride with AlH
 <sub>3</sub> has been proposed [

 <xref rid="B42-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], for example:
