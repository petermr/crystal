<p id="Par19">The supercell required for the small-displacement method consists of 32 atoms (1 × 1 × 2) per cell and a total of 12 k points are used in integrations over the Brillouin zone. The energy eigenvalues are broadened with a Gaussian with 20 mRy energy width. Most other computational details are the same as in our recent review article on plutonium
