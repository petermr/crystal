<p id="Par7">In most of the earlier investigations of α-plutonium the details of the monoclinic structure were assumed to be those of Zachariasen and Ellinger

 </sup>, observed at room temperature. Our DFT framework, however, considers zero temperature and a more thorough investigation of α-plutonium requires that the structure is resolved from theory. This was done recently

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> and the theoretical structural parameters at zero temperature are actually very close to the room-temperature x-ray results

 </sup>. The small differences (less than 2%), however, have a slight but noticeable effect on the chemical bonding and related properties of α-plutonium.
