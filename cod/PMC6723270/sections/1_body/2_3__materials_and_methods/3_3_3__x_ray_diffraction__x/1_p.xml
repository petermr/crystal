<p>All X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powder samples were performed at room temperature with a Brag–Brentano focusing geometry in a RIGAKU MINIFLEX II diffractometer, (Rigaku Company, Tokyo Japan), using CuKα radiation at 30 kV and 15 mA with a scan rate of 2° (2 θ min
 <sup>−1</sup>, sampling width of 0.01° (2θ), and between 3° and 70° (2θ). Rietveld refinement [
 <xref rid="B69-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], for the obtained birnessite-type materials, was performed with a General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) [
 <xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] using the EXPGUI interface [
 <xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. An experimental XRD pattern of a silicon powder was refined in order to obtain the instrumental parameter file. Because of the differences in the layer arrangements between each material, the initial structural parameters, triclinic [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and hexagonal [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] symmetries, were used. The crystallographic information file (CIF) was obtained from Crystallography Open Database [
 <xref rid="B72-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. All polyhedral crystal structure drawings were made by using Vesta software.
