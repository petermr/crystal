<p id="Par58">Using the more accurate block model, we expect to get smoother sinograms for the plane source (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), however, still not perfectly smooth. A slight non-uniformity is observed close to the edges of the detector blocks in the sinogram of the block model. This effect is well pronounced in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d in the normalization sinogram which is the result of the superposition of the measured sinograms followed by an inversion. This slight non-uniformity, unlike the severe non-uniformity in the cylindrical model, is because of the crystal interference effect within a block. It is a pattern that is repeated for the detectors in every block [
