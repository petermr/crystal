<p>A novel hot‐coating technique has been proposed to achieve high‐quality RPP films with favorable orientation for charge transfer eventually.[qv: 35,45d,64] In order to obtain high‐quality films, Tsai et al. reported that 2D perovskite (BA)

 <sub>+1</sub> single crystals were dissolved in DMF, and the solution was under continuous stirring for 30 min at 70 °C before the coating. Then, FTO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were preheated for 10 min from 30 to 150 °C, and the precursor solution was dropped on the hot substrate and spin coated at a speed of 5000 rpm for 20 s.

From AFM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, the films obtained by hot coating not only have larger grains, leading to a more compact and uniform film, but also have lower pinhole density, compared with films obtained by room‐temperature coating. From the synchronous diffraction data, the main growth direction of perovskite is along (101) plane parallel to the
