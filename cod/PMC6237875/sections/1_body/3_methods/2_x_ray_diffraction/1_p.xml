<p id="Par21">The single-crystal XRD experiments were conducted on the Extreme Conditions Beamline P02.2 at PETRA III, Hamburg, Germany (MAR345dtb image plate detector, Perkin Elmer XRD1621 flat panel detector, λ = 0.2898–0.2902 Å); on the ID09A (now ID15B) beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France (MAR555 detector, λ = 0.41273 Å); and on the 13-IDD beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Chicago, USA (MAR165 CCD detector, λ = 0.3344 Å). The X-ray spot size depended on the beamline settings and varied from 4 to 30 μm. Sample-to-detector distance, coordinates of the beam center, tilt angle, and tilt plane rotation angle of the detector images were calibrated using CeO
 <sub>2</sub> (for data collected at P02.2 beamline), Si (ID09A), and LaB
 <sub>6</sub> (13-IDD) powders. XRD images were collected during continuous rotation of DACs typically from –20 to + 20 on omega; while data collection experiments were performed by narrow 0.5–1° scanning of the same omega range. DIOPTAS software
