<p>QRs in an QREF for the LCD backlight application have to be arranged in a suitable configuration to provide the desired white balance of the backlight unit. There are two possible alternatives: first, mixing both types of QRs in the same film and optimizing the concentration. In this configuration, it is particularly important for the green emitting QRs to compensate for the reabsorption of the green emission by the low energy emitting QRs. Second, making a multiple layer stack and arranging the high‚Äêenergy emitters on top of the low energy emitters. Both of these alternatives were studied by Srivastava et al.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> The DOP of the mixed QREF and multiple layer QREF were measured as 0.67 and 0.76, obtained from Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>f and g, respectively. Based on these results, one can conclude that the multiple layer configuration is better. However, for LCD backlight applications, there are two scaling factors for the QREF brightness, first, the PL QY for the QRs, and second, the DOP of the aligned QREF. Thus, to enhance the LCD performance, both the PL QY and the DOP should be optimized.
