<p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was used to study the thermal stability of montmorillonite and further study the effect of layer charge density on the interlayer water precipitation temperature of montmorillonite. Derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) is a function of the rate of change of weight and temperature or time, which can accurately reflect the initial reaction temperature of samples. The combination of the two techniques can be used to study the thermal stability of montmorillonite and further study the effect of charge density on the water precipitation temperature between layers of montmorillonite. The TG analysis was carried out using a TG/SDTA851e thermogravimetric/differential thermal synchronizer, manufactured by Mettler-Toledo (Zurich, Switzerland), with a working gas of N
 <sub>2</sub> and a heating rate of 5 째C/min. The starting temperature was 40 째C, and the end temperature was 300 째C; the sample was thoroughly dried at 100 째C for 12 h in advance.
