 <italic>L–I–V</italic>) characteristics of these mini-CSPLED was measured at room temperature using a Keithley 2400 source meter and an integrated sphere with a calibrated power meter (CAS 140B, Instrument Systems, Munich). The spatial radiation patterns of these mini-CSPLEDs were measured using a goniophotometer (LEDGON-100, Instrument Systems, Munich). The BLU luminance and electroluminescence (EL) spectra with QD films were analyzed using a spectral luminance meter (SRI-RL-5000, Optimum Optoelectronics Corp., Taiwan).
