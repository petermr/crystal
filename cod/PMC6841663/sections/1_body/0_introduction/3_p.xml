<p id="Par4">Here we developed a ML-aided Local Structure Analyzer (ML-LSA) for classifying complex local mesoscopic structures of molecules that are composed of not only isotropic particles but also anisotropic rigid functional groups such as mesogens. The proposed ML-LSA was applied to classifying the local structures of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) systems.</p>
