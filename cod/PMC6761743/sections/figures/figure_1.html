 <caption> Representations of the crystal structures of (a) the rock salt-type MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and (b) the metal-deficient structure models M 31S 32 ≡ M 0.97S (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr 29S 32 ≡ Zr 0.91S. The structure models of M 31S 32 and Zr 29S 32 are derived from those of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), as the unit cells of M 31S 32 and Zr 29S 32 correspond to 2 × 2 × 2 expansions of the unit cells related to MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, and Lu). In the cases of M 31S 32, one transition-metal atom has been removed, while three zirconium atoms have been eliminated, leading to the Zr 29S 32 model. </caption>
