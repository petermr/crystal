 <p>We use first-principle calculations based on hybrid functional and the Bethe-Salpeter equation method to investigate the electronic and optical properties of dichalcogenide TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub>. Based on theoretical studies, TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub> has until recently been considered as an indirect band gap material, however; by employing more accurate hybrid functional model, we showed that although TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub> has an indirect band gap of 1.109 eV, it also exhibits a fundamental direct band gap of 1.129 eV. Our finding was further confirmed by the optical studies on TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub>, which show that the absorption peak is registered at a photon energy of 1.129 eV. It was also shown that TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub> has high optical absorption peaks in the visible region. Based on phonon and elastic constant calculations, it was shown that TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub> is dynamically and mechanically stable. Our findings show that TlGaTe
  <sub>2</sub> is a potential candidate for photovoltaic application.
