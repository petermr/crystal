 <xref rid="B19-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] presented the detailed model of the semicircular springs supported ring gyroscope, and Refs. [
 <xref rid="B11-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] presented the mathematical modeling of three-dimensional wineglass mode gyroscope. However, as for the complex multiring DRGs, no method has been proposed for the mathematical modeling.
