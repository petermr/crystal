<p>The activation energy (

 <sub>0.9</sub>Ba
 <sub>0.1</sub>Co
 <sub>0.95</sub>Ru
 <sub>0.05</sub>O
 <sub>3−δ</sub> can be obtained from the Arrhenius plots of the resistance as a function of temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f008">Figure 8</xref>). This value of activation energy, 
 <italic>E
  <sub>a</sub>
 </italic> = 1.50 eV, is associated with the process of oxygen reduction reaction and is comparable to that observed for electrodes of the SrCo
 <sub>1−x</sub>M
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>3−δ</sub> family, also included in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f008">Figure 8</xref>. It is also noticeable that the presented Ba-doped electrode presents an improvement in the total conductivity with respect to the parent Ru-containing compound.
