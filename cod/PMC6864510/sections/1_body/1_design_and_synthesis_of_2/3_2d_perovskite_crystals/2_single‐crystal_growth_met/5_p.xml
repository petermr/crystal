<p>In addition to single ammonium cations, diammonium cations are also introduced to synthesize 2D perovskites. Diammonium cations have an advantage that complex R′ is more liable to form 2D layers and diammonium cations can eliminate van der Waals gaps and directly connect the layers together.[qv: 10b,33] 2D diammonium single‐crystal NH

 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Although the inorganic layers are slightly distorted by the spatial constraints imposed by the diammonium cations, these perovskites have a typical corner‐sharing structure. Through the crystallography in these 2D materials, the well‐defined cation positions showed slower cation movement and migration than MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub>, which is capable of overcoming stability problems.
