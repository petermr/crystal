 <p>M.E. developed the computer algorithms and software, with major contributions from V.K., and performed structural refinements and data analysis. H.Y.P., K.C., J.W., and B.R. collected neutron total scattering, X-ray total scattering, and EXAFS data, respectively. A.B. collected single-crystal diffuse-scattering data and reconstructed the 3D diffuse-intensity distributions. I.L. conceived and guided the study, collected and analyzed data, and wrote the paper with input from M.E. and V.K. All the authors read and approved the paper.</p>
