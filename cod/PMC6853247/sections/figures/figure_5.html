 <caption> (a) [100] projection of the electron density isosurface of the structure solution. Note that the size of the “balls” is related to the number of electrons on the site, enabling both the identification of the atomic species and the site occupation refinement. (b) [100] projection of the proposed model in term of polyhedral pattern. </caption>
