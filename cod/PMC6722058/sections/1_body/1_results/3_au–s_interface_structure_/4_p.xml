 <sub>57</sub>, and Au

 <sub>84</sub> have single bridged ligands that do not resemble the arrangement of protecting units. The number of bridged ligands added on the surface of each of these clusters is in the range of 2–18 and can be seen from the difference of the number of ligands in total and in the units shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For some of the systems the total number of the interface atoms added on the surface exceeds the true number of ligands, but regardless of that the algorithm is accurate enough for predicting both the number and the positions of the bridge ligands by the ranking criteria. These results confirm that in the true structures the number of interface atoms in linear SR–Au–SR conformations is often maximized. This is automatically taken into account in the design of the algorithm and is also build into the CSE measuring the goodness of the model structures.
