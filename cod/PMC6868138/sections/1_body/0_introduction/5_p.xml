<p id="Par7">Here, we show that photo-inverting the handedness of the molecular motors initiates a cascade of bottom-up events. This molecular-scale event leads to inversion of the liquid crystal helix, further into inversion of the spiral organization of the director field in the droplet, and eventually leading to modification of the flow of fluid matter that steers the helical propulsion. Droplets subjected to such an inversion of handedness reorient their swimming in a direction that is encoded by the number of spiral turns in the droplet.</p>
