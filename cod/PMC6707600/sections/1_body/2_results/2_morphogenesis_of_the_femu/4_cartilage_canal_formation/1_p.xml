<p>Incipient cartilage canal invasion at the proximal epiphysis was first observed on the surface of the femoral neck in fetuses with a CRL of 62 mm (OSL, 5.7 mm; 
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cartilage canals at the trochanteric fossa were detected in fetuses with a CRL of 69 mm (OSL, 8.7 mm), which increased and attained the double-positive stage (++) of cartilage canal formation in all fetuses with a CRL of â‰¥75 mm (OSL, 9.8 mm). In contrast, cartilage canals at the femoral head fovea were observed in much larger fetuses and were detected for the first time in fetuses with a CRL of 84.5 mm (OSL, 13.8 mm).
