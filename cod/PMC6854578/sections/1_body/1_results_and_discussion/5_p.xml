<p>The ion-oxygen radial distribution functions (RDFs) in the first three layers are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a,b. For comparison, the ion-oxygen RDF in the solution is also shown. The position of the first peak in RDFs corresponds to the average radius of the FHS, and the area included by the first peak is proportional to

 <sub>w</sub>. For both cation and anion, the interface has little effect on the average radius of the FHS, which can be seen in the inset of 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a,b. For Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>â€“</sup> in the first layer, as shown by the green line in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a,b, the first peak of ion-oxygen RDF is obviously lower than others, which indicates that the interface has an unneglectable effect on 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>. However, this effect only works in the first layer, and for the second and third layers, the first peak of ion-oxygen RDF is approximately equal to that in solutions.
