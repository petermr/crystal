<p id="Par25">The light-responsive chiral liquid crystal prepared by this procedure was then introduced in a glass wedge cell (E.H.C. Co.) and its pitch was measured using the Grandjean Cano method, with a polarized optical microscope (Olympus BX51). The pitch of the liquid crystal helices doped with Me-
 <bold>m</bold> and Ph-
 <bold>m</bold> were measured in the dark, and subsequently at the photostationary state, by using
