<p>It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01052-f012">Figure 12</xref>. that the maximum pressure of the ARX model was 0.1448 MPa, while that of the ARMAX model was 0.1439 MPa. The matching rate of ARM model and ARMAX model was 92.72% and 92.57%, respectively, which results in the ARMAX model being slightly more accurate than the ARM model.
