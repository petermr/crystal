<p>Interestingly, PAH-s and especially pyrene derivatives have not been so far extensively studied by X-ray diffraction at high pressure. The works of Fabbiani et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] described the structure evolution and phase transitions in naphthalene, anthracene, and unsubstituted pyrene recrystallized under pressure, at pressures up to 2.1 GPa. The literature cited therein suggested that carbonization of crystalline naphthalene may occur at a pressure as low as 2.5 GPa. On the other hand, the X-ray diffraction study by Capitani [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] carried out up to 25 GPa showed that phenanthrene remained crystalline up to ca. 20 GPa, undergoing phase transition around 8 GPa. A recent paper by Chanyshev et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] dealt with high-pressure and high-temperature-induced structural changes in benzene. Apart from that, a short note on the structure of benzo[a]pyrene [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] under pressure is available. In a wider perspective, a high-pressure study of organic conductor rubrene [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that pressure-induced molecular rearrangement resulted in a phase transition and a loss of conducting properties of that material above 6 GPa.
