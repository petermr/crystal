 </sup> was implemented by creating an initial hybrid system with half of the computational box containing the crystalline solid configuration at 150 K and the other half with the liquid configuration at several temperatures between 200–250 K. It was clearly seen that for all temperatures below 220 K the crystalline solid prevailed by solidifying the liquid half of the box. Meanwhile for temperatures 220–250 K, the liquid configuration overcame. As the temperature neared 220 K from above, a steep increase in MMC lattice steps were required.
