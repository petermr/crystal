<p>A PROG-DOD crystal specimen was obtained by employing a procedure similar to the methods used for PROG-CNA and PROG-DHB. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that PROG-DOD is composed of PROG and DOD in a 1:1 molecular stoichiometry ratio. The refinement of the PROG-DOD structure converged at a final residual factor 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.0616. PROG-DOD was found to be a monoclinic crystal system and to have a chiral space group of 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>. This evidence constitutes a difference when comparing PROG-DOD with the PROG-DHB and PROG-CNA systems. This difference may be caused by the longer backbone of the DOD molecule.
