 <caption> ( a) Garnet crystal structure (space group: Ia-3 d) of Ca 3Fe 2Ge 3O 12; the conventional cell with the cubic structure (Ca 24Fe 16Ge 24O 96, 160 atoms) is shown. ( b) Distribution of equivalent 48 g and 96 h′ sites after the optimization of the internal coordinates with one doubly charged O i . The internal coordinates of the cations and O are equal to those of the perfect crystal; only the changes in the internal coordinates of O i are shown in the optimized cells. In the calculations, one O i is incorporated in the computational cell. Nearest-neighboring atoms of ( c) O in the perfect crystal, ( d) O i in the 48 g site, and ( e) O i in the 96 h′ site in the optimized structure including one O i . The numerical values are the distances (bond lengths), expressed in Å. The cutoff radius for the nearest-neighboring atoms in the figure is 2.8 Å, which is ~10% longer than the longest Ca–O bond. </caption>
