<p>In summary, we analyzed the experimental electron densities of the BCA crystal under high pressure and demonstrated how DORI intuitively captures the dramatic effects of noncovalent interactions on bonding patterns. Our approach relies on a connected component search algorithm, which avoids the arbitrary selection of the DORI isovalue and provides a general framework for the causeâ€“effect analysis of electronic structure patterns in molecular crystals under pressure or under any distinct (e.g., temperature, condensed environment) conditions.</p>
