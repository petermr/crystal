<p>Particularly when working with very fragile nanostructures, a new approach, the shadow-FIB method introduced by Welz 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2005
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb54"> ▸</xref>), enables nearly artefact-free TEM specimen preparation by using the substrate as protection during heavy-ion milling. Thus, the shadow-FIB method circumvents the deposition of metal protective layers and keeps modifications and contaminations to a low level. The shadow-FIB procedure has enabled site- and orientation-specific sectioning of fragile specimens such as layered crystals (Spiecker 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb47"> ▸</xref>), organic films (Kim

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> ▸</xref>; Mor 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb39"> ▸</xref>) and in particular anisotropic nanostructures (Tessarek 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
