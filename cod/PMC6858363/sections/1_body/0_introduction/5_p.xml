<p id="Par6">Here, we present results of our experimental study on the Cu(410) surface, using QLEED analyses. To get the optimum (theoretical) energy dependent intensity 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>E</italic>) curves, we considered slab thickness ranging from 24 to 64 atomic layers, with corresponding relaxed layers ranging from 8 to 32 atomic layers. We confirmed the consistency of the results with Pendry reliability factors
