<p id="Par22">In summary, the polarization switching mechanism of the bilayer 3R MoS
 <sub>2</sub> whose direction of the polarization is reversed by the change of the stacking sequence was investigated. The ferroelectric switching was achieved by driving the interlayer shear mode through the anharmonic energy flow from the optically pumped infrared mode. Remarkably, due to the selection rule from the crystal symmetry of MoS
 <sub>2</sub>, the degenerate interlayer shear mode can only be driven along its armchair axis whether the infrared mode is pumped along the zigzag or armchair axis. However, the optical pulse should be polarized along the zigzag axis for successful switching since the direction of anharmonic force is aligned with the switching direction. The coherent light pulses can amplify the interlayer shear mode substantially and unidirectionally, displacing the stacking sequence into the opposite polarization. The scheme for optical modulation of the stacking structure can be applied to other 2D materials exhibiting the interlayer shear mode to explore various stacking-dependent properties in a dynamical manner.
