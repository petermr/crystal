<p>In this work, we investigated extensively the pressure-induced structural, mechanical, and vibrational properties of GeSe using first principles based on the DFT. The pressure dependencies of the structural parameters including the lattice parameters, bond lengths, and atomic coordinates reveal the characteristics of the continuous second-order phase transition of GeSe from 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> to 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> at 34 GPa. The electronic properties undergo significant change under applied pressure. The band gap of GeSe becomes narrow, and it ultimately closes at 10 GPa. The structural stability of GeSe in the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> and 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> phases is confirmed by the elastic constants and the phonon spectra. The pressure dependency of the elastic constants and the vibration phonon at the center point reveal the origin of the second-order phase transition mechanism in GeSe. The group theory analysis shows that the phase transition is induced by the softening of the low-frequency phonon mode in the interlayer.
