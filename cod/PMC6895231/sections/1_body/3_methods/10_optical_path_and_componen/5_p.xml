<p id="Par59">In 3D-SAROM setup, we used three diode lasers stabilized at different temperatures in order to control laser wavelength. Each laser beam propagates through separate beam expanders (lenses f1, f2). Final beam diameter for three laser beams was 10 mm. All beams combined by polarized beamsplitter BS2 (Edmund Optics, cat. no. 49–870) and non-polarized beamsplitter BS4 (Edmund Optics, cat. no. 49–005).</p>
