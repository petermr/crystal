<p>Our work shows the importance of reactant chemistry in aliovalent cation exchange reactions in Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S nanocrystals. Noncomplexed GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> reacts as Lewis acid, extracting S
 <sup>2–</sup> from the nanocrystals, thereby etching them. Etching is inhibited when GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> is bound to a phosphine ligand in a GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–L complex (L = trioctylphosphine, triphenylphosphite, and diphenylphosphine). GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP was found to be unreactive, whereas GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP lead to successful exchange of Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>, converting the parent Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S nanocrystals into CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub> nanocrystals. This is rationalized by considering that the activated Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S–GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–L complex that forms at the surface of the nanocrystal upon adsorption of the GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–L complex must allow for simultaneous Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> insertion and Cu
 <sup>+</sup> extraction, while preventing S
 <sup>2–</sup> extraction. This requirement is only fulfilled by activated complexes in which the Ga–P bond is sufficiently weak. DFT calculations show that the Ga–P bond strength decreases with increasing electron-withdrawing nature of the side groups of the phosphine ligand. Our findings highlight several factors (viz., Lewis acidity, influence of ligand electronic properties on reactivity) which need be taken into account when designing cation exchange protocols. Finally, we showed that the mechanism proposed here is generally applicable by using GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP to convert CuInS
 <sub>2</sub> nanocrystals into Cu-poor (Cu,Ga,In)S
 <sub>2</sub> nanocrystals with an increased photoluminescence quantum yield in the NIR spectral window.
