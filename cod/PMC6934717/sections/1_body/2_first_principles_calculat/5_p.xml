<p id="Par17">We have therefore conducted calculations of this interlayer magnetic coupling. Here we report the energy difference, per unit cell, between the ground-state stripe magnetic order (which is antiferromagnetically coupled along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis) and a state with ferromagnetic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis coupling. We have done this at the experimental lattice parameter of 12.104 Å, and in addition for 
 <italic>c</italic> values 5% larger and smaller than this value. For the experimental 
 <italic>c</italic>-lattice parameter, we find an interlayer coupling energy difference of 7.1 mRyd/u.c., which increases slightly to 7.7 mRyd for the +5% 
 <italic>c</italic> value, but decreases sharply to some 4.5 mRyd for the −5% 
 <italic>c</italic> value. These values are in qualitative agreement with the previous work on BaFe

 </sup>, where it was found that the application of pressure decreases the interlayer coupling. We mention also that the calculated magnetic moments decrease substantially for the smaller cell, and correspondingly increase for the larger cell. In the antiferromagnetically coupled layer state, for the smallest cell these moments are 1.25 μ
