<p id="Par40">In order to acquire the optimal Mn doping concentration, the emission peak and FWHM variation are analyzed and shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. It can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a that the PL intensity increases as the concentration of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> is increased from 3.04 to 6.45 mg/mL. Further increasing the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration makes the PL intensity decrease, which is due to the self-Abs effect at high concentration. During the whole process, the PL peak position and the FWHM remains the same. In other words, the change of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration has no effect on the PL emission peak and FWHM, which are also verified by the color coordinates chart (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). No matter how the concentration changes, the color coordinates are basically maintained at (0.535, 0.460) (the black dots). Therefore, the concentration of 6.45 mg/mL is taken as the optimal concentration.
