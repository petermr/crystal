  <p>Overall structure of the 
   <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II riboswitch. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Secondary structure of the environmental sequence 1 (
   <italic>env1</italic>) 2′-dG-II riboswitch annotated with nucleobase-nucleobase interactions. Base interaction notation is that of Leontis and Westhof (
   <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Cartoon representation of the crystal structure of the 
   <italic>env1</italic> riboswitch aptamer domain in complex with 2′-deoxyguanosine (magenta). Watson–Crick helices (P1 – P3) are denoted in blue, the two terminal loops (L2 and L3) in orange and the three joining regions of the three-way junction (J1/2, J2/3 and J3/1) are shown in cyan, green and yellow, consistent with panel (A). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Superimposition of the 
   <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch aptamer domain (orange) with 
   <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG riboswitch aptamer domain (blue). In each RNA, the P1 helix was truncated to the three Watson–Crick base pairs proximal to the three way junction. The RNAs align with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.95 Å using PyMOL.
