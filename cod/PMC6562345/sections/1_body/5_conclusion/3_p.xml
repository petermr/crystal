<p>More generally, our results provide a further demonstration of the complex interplay between framework and guest in determining the structures of the hybrid perovskites. In contrast with their inorganic analogues, hostâ€“guest hydrogen bonding may stabilize particular structures but only over a relatively small pressure, temperature or composition range. The complexity of the resulting phase diagrams invites substantial further investigation of the consequences for these materials' properties.</p>
