<p>Previous combined STM/AFM experiments show a strong distortion of the O

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). PP–PW (PBE+U) and AE–LCAO (B3LYP) support this result with the O
 <sub>2
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> moving up by 0.28 and 0.31 Å, respectively. AE–LCAO (HSE) reproduces this trend with a normal displacement of 0.38 Å, identical to the PP–PW–PBE+U result.
