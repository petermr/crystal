<p>When going from B
 <sub>6</sub>P to α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, it is obvious that the sharp modes for ordered α-B
 <sub>12</sub> and B
 <sub>6</sub>P become broad bands. This has already been described by Aselage and Tallant.

 </sup> Bands associated with exo-bonds (both B–B and B–Si) fall in a range 850–1000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, whereas skeleton modes are essentially confined between 650 and 800 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (but distribute partially to even lower wavenumbers). The hump at 521 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> may be associated with libration. The Si–Si stretching mode of the dumbbell may be suspected at 412 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. However, the analysis of calculated phonons (see below) shows that also the displacement of Si atoms on the polar position falls in this range of wavenumber. This is in agreement with the vibrational spectrum of 1,2-dimethyl-
 <italic>ortho</italic>-disilaborane, (CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>Si
 <sub>2</sub>B
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>.

 </sup> Additional modes at lower wavenumbers are associated with Si
 <sub>2</sub> dumbbell rotations and translations, coupled with displacements of Si atoms, which are part of the icosahedron. This information was obtained from an inspection of the phonon DOS (pDOS) of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> structural models (see below) and the analysis of frequencies and displacements at the Γ point.
