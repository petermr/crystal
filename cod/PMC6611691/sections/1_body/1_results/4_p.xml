<p>To quantify this unusual asymmetric response, we plot in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> the integrated area (shaded area in the right-hand panel of 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) between the two reflections normalized to the magnitude of the MR (i.e., the difference between the resistivity values at 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>c</italic> and 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>a</italic>). The inset in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> shows a blowup of the region between 10 and 40 K. A clear onset in the asymmetry is revealed at a temperature 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>asym</sub> = 24 Â± 1 K, implying that it is intimately connected to the resistivity upturn at 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>. Moreover, the growth in the asymmetry near 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> resembles that of an order parameter. Below 10 K however, the asymmetry grows much more steeply (see the main panel of 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> for 
 <italic>I</italic>//
 <italic>a</italic>, and fig. S2 for corresponding data for 
 <italic>I</italic>//
 <italic>b</italic>).
