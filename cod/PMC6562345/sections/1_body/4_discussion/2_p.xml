<p>The difference between these materials' behaviour can be rationalized in terms of the hydrogen bonding between guanidinium and formate ions. 
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the N–H · 
 <italic>s</italic>O distance in 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CdGF</bold>, as determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments and DFT calculations. In each case, the DFT values are 0.05 Å to 0.08 Å smaller than the diffraction results at ambient temperature and pressure. In 
 <bold>MnGF</bold>, the DFT N · 
 <italic>s</italic>O distances fall by at most 0.025 Å across the phase transition. Even considering the energy minima, rather than the structures immediately before and after the phase transition, the differences in distance between the phases range from 0.03 Å to 0.04 Å. This result is slightly smaller than the experimental values of 0.03 Å to 0.09 Å, where, to provide the most accurate experimental comparison, we have combined the atomic coordinates from single-crystal diffraction with lattice parameters from powder diffraction at a pressure where the phases coexist.
