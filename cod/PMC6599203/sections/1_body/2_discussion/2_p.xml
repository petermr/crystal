<p id="Par31">On the practical side, application of this Raman spectroscopy method generally requires an optically polished or a naturally flat incident surface and, in absorbing materials like GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub>, one have to limit the laser power in the focused area in a way to avoid local heating or even laser-induced surface degradation. Since cubic materials are optically isotropic, one might also expect that when using a uniformly polished surface of the pellet and when paying an attention to maintain the same focus, power and similar geometrical conditions, one could perhaps directly use the recorded 
 <italic>E</italic>-mode intensities, without their normalisation to the intensity of 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>-mode. However, in the case of our GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub> ceramics, this strategy was not successful, and in spite of our utmost care, the overall scattering intensity considerably varied from grain to grain, and we had to use the relative mode intensities.
