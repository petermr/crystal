<p>For one, we considered only isotropic phonons, whose spectrum deviates from the true one especially in the high frequency regime. Furthermore, we have neglected the dislocation core as well as the separation of dislocations into partials. However, the uncertainties in the experimental (or computational) determination of the TOEC also have a large effect on the accuracy of our present predictions. We also need to stress that the present model is limited to the subsonic regime, i.e.,
