<p>The infrared spectra were recorded in the spectral range between 4000 and 250 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in KBr pellets with a Perkin–Elmer FTIR/FIRS Spectrometer Frontier instrument. A total of 32 scans were performed. Raman spectra were obtained using a HORIBA LabRam HR Evolution Raman microscope at room temperature. A He–Ne laser was employed with an energy of 633 nm from 20 mW to 100 mW and a slit of 100 µm. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained on a Perkin–Elmer PHI 5100 model with a Mg Kα source under a vacuum of 4 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> torr. All the spectra were corrected to alkyl type carbon C1s (285.0 eV) and fitted by applying a Tougard baseline and a Gaussian–Lorentzian function to each peak.
