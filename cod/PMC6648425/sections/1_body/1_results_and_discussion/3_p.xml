<p>Prior to examining the oxygen diffusion in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>, magnetic configurations and the most likely position of oxygen vacancies should be investigated, since they determine the stable magnetic and crystal structures in which oxygen atoms diffuse. Again, we aim to address the diffusion of oxygen atom that is assumed to be externally injected. Experiments have shown that oxygen vacancies are concentrated at the Pr–O layers, and our results also indicate that oxygen vacancy is most likely to form at the Pr–O layers (

 <sub>O@PrO</sub>) compared to that at the Co–O layers (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@CoO</sub>) and at the Ba–O layers (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@BaO</sub>) when the lattice parameters of the vacancy containing simulation cells were fully relaxed. For example, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@PrO</sub> is more stable than 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@CoO</sub> by 0.77 eV and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@BaO</sub> by 3.06 eV in the paramagnetic phase. Therefore, the lattice constant of the structure obtained with 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@PrO</sub> is used even for the calculation of 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@CoO</sub> and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@BaO</sub>. The calculated lattice constants for 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O@PrO</sub> are summarized for comparison with the experimental values in
