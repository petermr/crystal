<p>We thus conclude that the 
 <italic>proton hole diffusion at the ZnO(101[combining macron]0)–water interface is pseudo-one-dimensional</italic>, with a high rate of adlayer-PT events yielding diffusion along the nonpolar ±[12[combining macron]10] direction, and a very low rate of solvent-assisted PT events contributing to the relatively small diffusion along the polar [0001] direction.
