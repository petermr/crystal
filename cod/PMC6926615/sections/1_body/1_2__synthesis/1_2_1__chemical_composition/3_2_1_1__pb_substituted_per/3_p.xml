<p>The band gap of tin-based perovskite also can be altered by the changing the chemical composition of A cation. Mixed-cation perovskite system based on the substitution of cesium (Cs+) with rubidium (Rb+) in tin bromide perovskites Cs

 <sub>x</sub>SnBr
 <sub>3</sub>, has been experimentally demonstrated in [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The pure single-phase samples in compositional range of CsSnBr
 <sub>3</sub>–Cs
 <sub>0.70</sub>Rb
 <sub>0.30</sub>SnBr
 <sub>3</sub> were obtained by high temperature (600 °C) synthesis and all the rubidium-embedding alloys showed a good stability. During chemical substitution from CsSnBr
 <sub>3</sub> to Cs
 <sub>0.70</sub>R
 <sub>0.30</sub>SnBr
 <sub>3</sub>, the crystal lattice passes from cubic to orthorhombic symmetry, which was correlated with optical properties, since the band gap varies from 1.719 to 1.817 eV. To further boost the efficiency and stability of Sn-based perovskite, organic amine salts, such as butylamine (BA), were introduced into the crystal lattice [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This method allows more effective control of the crystallization kinetics of low-dimensional Sn perovskite films, due to which these structures acquire improved stability, homogeneity, and oriented crystal growth. Therefore, the crystallization kinetics jointly controlled by Lewis adducts and the ion exchange process using a mixture of ion liquid solvent methylammonium acetate and polar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is demonstrated.
