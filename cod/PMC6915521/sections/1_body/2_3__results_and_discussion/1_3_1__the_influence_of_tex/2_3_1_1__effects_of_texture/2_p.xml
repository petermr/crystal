 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the average friction forces of the smooth surface and textured surfaces. Compared with the smooth surface, textured surfaces can reduce average friction forces effectively, and the average friction forces decrease with an increase in texture depth, which is consistent with the conclusions of Refs.
