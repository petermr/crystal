<p>The transformation of carbon dioxide into novel and useful chemicals remains one of the most important research challenges of modern chemistry. Application of CO
 <sub>2</sub> as a C
 <sub>1</sub> building block is highly attractive due to its relative abundance and, in particular, as a method to address long‐established concerns about its role as an atmospheric greenhouse gas.
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> One potential method is the transformation of CO
 <sub>2</sub> into carbon monoxide, CO, which is a common feedstock for large‐scale industrial processes (e.g. Fischer–Tropsch alkane synthesis).
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> This has led to great interest in the identification and study of well‐defined molecular systems capable of directly cleaving the C=O bond in CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Such transformations are highly challenging due to the high strength of the C=O bond (bond enthalpy 532 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>).

 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> and a number of examples based on precious
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> and f‐block metals
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> have also been reported. In comparison, the use of earth‐abundant late 3d metals remains surprisingly underexplored, particularly given the role that such metals play in biological CO
 <sub>2</sub> reduction to CO, mediated by Ni,Fe CO dehydrogenase.
