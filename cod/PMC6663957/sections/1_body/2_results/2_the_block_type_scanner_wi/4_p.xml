<p id="Par51">Visual comparison between the reconstructed images of the Derenzo phantom indicates a significant improvement for the block model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Smallest spheres of 1.6 mm diameter can be clearly resolved using the new model even without applying normalization. Whereas, it is not possible to distinguish between some sources of 1.6 mm diameter in the cylindrical model after applying normalization. A circular artifact is observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a which stays after normalization in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c.
