<p>We now illustrate the use of the 
 <italic>LSITESYM</italic> program described in Section 2
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2"/>, taking as an example MoS
 <sub>2</sub> and WS
 <sub>2</sub> layered crystals which belong to the transition metal dichalco­genide crystal family. Although the structure of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> was determined about 100 years ago and this layered crystal was used mainly as a dry lubricant, the new wave of interest in transition metal dichalcogenides began after the discovery of graphene. This interest, apart from the fundamental properties of monolayers, is connected with the observation of the direct band gap of 1.8 eV at the 
 <italic>K</italic> point in the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> monolayer, even though the bulk MoS
 <sub>2</sub> crystal is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV. The transition to a direct band gap makes the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> monolayer an excellent candidate as a solar photovoltaic material owing to the drastic enhancement of photoluminescence in the monolayer compared with the bulk. Other crystals of the transition metal dichalcogenide family, like WS
 <sub>2</sub>, have similar electronic properties.
