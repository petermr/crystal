<p>GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP was prepared in a N
 <sub>2</sub>-filled glovebox, by addition of 0.815 mL (4.683 mmol) DPP to an equimolar amount (0.8246 g) of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>, followed by heating to 50 °C under constant stirring. After a few minutes, an opaque, white, viscous liquid formed. Over the course of several hours, the liquid changed into an opaque, white, crystalline solid, which was dissolved in 10 mL of toluene at 100 °C.
