<p>Molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes are unique photoswitches that are able to undergo unidirectional rotation upon irradiation with light [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, they can be used as chiroptical multistate switches to control various functions in areas such as catalysis [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], soft materials [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and supramolecular chemistry [
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Employing molecular motors as ligands in SCCs provides an interesting strategy to form responsive coordination complexes, as they feature a large geometric change upon switching [
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
