 <caption> Proposed mechanism for additive-assisted film formation. Decreasing of the additive/perovskite ratio during spin-coating and annealing (a–c) leads to stacking of preformed crystalline units coordinated by 3-CPACl through the Pb–Cl bond resulting in an organized and compact final perovskite layer (d). The green structure represents the additive which coordinates Pb 2+ in the perovskite unit cell. </caption>
