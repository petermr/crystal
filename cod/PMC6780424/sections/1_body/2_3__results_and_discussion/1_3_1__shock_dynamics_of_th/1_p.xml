<p>The 11 crystals studied were rapidly compressed under shock, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The temperature and pressure of the systems increased as a function of time during the shock process. The molecules were packed more densely in space and the chemical bonds plastically deformed to break, leading to the decomposition of material. According to our simulation, the N–NO
 <sub>2</sub> bond, N–O bond and C–NO
 <sub>2</sub> bond were the most active chemical bonds to deform and break in the CL-20 molecule, BTF molecule and TATB molecule, respectively, under shock. We therefore denoted these bonds as the “trigger bonds”.
