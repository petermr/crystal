<p>The operation of future aero-engines must conform to strict environmental and performance targets. The latter present a challenge to the aerospace industry, and in order to meet them, the turbine entry temperatures (TET) must increase above ~2100 K. In modern aero-engines the TET does not exceed ~1873 K. Ni-based superalloys, which currently are the materials of choice for airfoil applications in gas turbine engines, operate at homologous temperatures approaching 0.8 and pushing them to even higher temperatures is limited by the melting temperature of Ni. Thus, new materials are required to replace Ni-based superalloys. </p>
