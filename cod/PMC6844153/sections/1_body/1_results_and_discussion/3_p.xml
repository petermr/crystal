<p>All few-chain systems calculated previously have similar properties to a single chain. To determine the boundary between such few-chain systems and bulk systems, we plotted the changes in the band gap for a number of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains, as in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>. The band gap decreases as the number of chains increases, as does the change of the band gap. We expected that a decrease in the band gap (Δ
 <italic>E</italic>) by the number of chains (
 <italic>n</italic>) would approach the band gap in bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> at 0.54 eV and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> at 0.65 eV. We interpolated the tendency between Δ
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>n</italic> as an exponential curve. From this interpolation, 
 <italic>n</italic> satisfying |Δ
 <italic>E</italic>(
 <italic>n</italic>) – Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>bulk</sub>| &lt; 0.01 eV, where Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>bulk</sub> is the band gap of the bulk system, is expected to be greater than 24 in V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and 20 in Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. These numbers of chains can construct a triple-layer bundle with hexagonal stacking. The short interchain distance between two V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains is 6.79 Å and the distance between two Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains is 6.86 Å. Therefore, the shortest diameter of a triple-layer V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> bundle is approximately 20.37 Å, and that of a triple-layer Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> bundle is approximately 20.58 Å (supposing the cross-section of a bundle is an ellipse). The exponential function decays fast, and the number of chains enough to have a band gap similar to the bulk from exponential interpolation could be the lower bound. Thus, we believe that V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> SCACs thinner than about ∼20 Å would have the characteristics of single chains, such as a direct band gap. In the previous study of Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> without dispersion correction, a value of 36 Å was suggested.
