<p id="Par17">The definition of PNRs according to the local alignment angle disregards displacement directions. We added this directional specificity by identifying those Pb atoms that have their displacement vectors aligned with the 〈111〉 directions. Pb atoms displaced along a given 〈111〉 direction also form extended 3D clusters, which we will refer to as 〈111〉-PNRs. The 〈111〉-PNRs and 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs have comparable sizes, however, the correlation length of the displacement magnitudes within the 〈111〉-PNRs is considerably shorter than that of the displacement directions.
