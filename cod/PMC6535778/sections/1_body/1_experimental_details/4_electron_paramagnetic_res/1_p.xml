<p>A single crystal of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> was stored in the glovebox before EPR measurements, and then placed in a closed sample tube. The sample tube was put into the EPR cavity. The experiment was carried out on a Bruker ER 300D spectrometer interfaced to a Bruker 1600 computer for data storage and manipulations. The spectrum was collected by sweeping the magnetic field from 0 to 5000 G.
