<p id="p0135">So, the results of the study allow us to make an unambiguous conclusion that the increase in the 
 <italic>b</italic> NCN0.25 parameter is due to the adsorption of the oxygen in the interlayer space. The adsorption-active centers in this case may be Na atoms located in the interlayer space and having a coordination number different from 12. This assumption has been made on the basis of data on the structure of NaCa
 <sub>4</sub>Nb
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>17</sub> [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Nd
 <sub>4</sub>Ca
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>20</sub> [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the compounds belonging to the A
 <sub>n</sub>B
 <sub>n</sub>O
 <sub>3n+2</sub> series. The authors of these works have found that A cations are located on the border of the perovskite layers, the number of which is greater in the compound. The appearance of the phase R2 with the parameter 
 <italic>b</italic>, intermediate between the parameters 
 <italic>b</italic> of the phases R1 and R3, indicates that the adsorption of the oxygen in the interlayer space occurs similarly to the adsorption of atoms by the surface of mono- or polycrystalline objects. Due to lateral interaction, the adatoms are first adsorbed to one side of the interlayer space, with the result that the R2 phase appears with an intermediate parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> = 61.83 Å, which corresponds to 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10.4 [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a certain temperature range, the low-temperature and intermediate phases coexist. When the adatoms fully occupy one side of the interlayer space, the other side begins to be filled up and the high-temperature phase R3 with 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11 appears, coexisting with the intermediate phase in a certain temperature range. In our experiment, when the sample is heated, the oxygen desorption occurs first from one surface of the interlayer space, an intermediate phase appears, then the desorption from another surface and the transition of NCN0.25 to the initial state with 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10. It is known [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that during the adsorption of the adatoms, the recovery of a sample occurs much faster if it is cooled from the temperature at which the intermediate phase exists. In order to ensure that the intermediate phase R2 appears as a result of oxygen adsorption, the sample NCN0.25 was heated to 383 K after its full recovery, where there was only intermediate phase R2, and then cooled to 303 K with the same step of 10° and a holding time of 10 min. At room temperature, the XRD patterns were recorded after 15 h and then 3 days after heating. The XRD patterns are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. It can be seen that after cooling NCN0.25 from 383 K after 15 h at room temperature, its radiograph does not contain the lines of the high-temperature phase; only the low-temperature phase R1 and a small amount of the intermediate phase R2 are present in the sample. After 3 days, NCN0.25 fully recovered to the R1 phase, while during cooling from the high-temperature R3 phase, the sample still remained biphasic in a week.
