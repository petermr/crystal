<p>Since graphene was obtained in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], 2-dimensional (2D) materials have developed a wide interest all over the world. Due to the ultrathin thickness, the materials exhibit unique electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties, which inspires explorations of other more 2D materials. So far, dozens of 2D materials have been prepared experimentally, including the graphene family (e.g., graphdiyne [
 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], silicene [
 <xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], germanene [

 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), Ⅲ-nitrides [
 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Ⅲ-bismides [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], transition metal dichalcogenides [
 <xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], metal carbides [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the like, yet it remains a problem to prepare high-quality 2D material with larger sizes. Although a few kinds of 2D materials such as graphene and MoS

 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] can be obtained by exfoliating corresponding layered bulk materials, others, such as silicene [

 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], cannot be produced in this way because there exists no corresponding layered bulk material in nature. Vapor deposition of atoms on a substrate should be much more flexible and has been applied for preparing various 2D materials of large scale [

 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, much time and effort have to be paid to explore the growth conditions because the surface structure and the temperature of the substrate both have significant effects on the growth of 2D materials. As an example for preparing silicene by deposition of Si atoms on a silver substrate, the growth on the (001) surface only produces a “complex” superstructure without clear symmetry [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and on the (110) surface, silicon nanoribbons (NRs) form along the
