<p>To conclude, we have developed an 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics method based on the multiscale shock technique and performed shock wave simulation tests for the sensitive explosive BTF, insensitive explosive TATB, four polymorphs of CL-20 crystals and five novel CL-20 cocrystals, with each model containing ~1000 atoms. The main conclusion includes:
