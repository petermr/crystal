<p>Another important specification of the phosphor considered for application in white LEDs is the colour purity. This can be evaluated by calculating the colour coordinates from the respective emission spectra. The fragments of CIE 1931 colour space diagram together with Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration-dependent colour coordinates at room temperature and temperature-dependent colour coordinates of 1%, 50%, and 100% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> doped samples are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f005">Figure 5</xref>a–d, respectively. All the colour coordinates are located directly on the edge of the CIE 1931 colour space diagram showing high colour purity of all synthesized materials. It is also evident that colour coordinates for samples doped with higher Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration shift downward the edge of the CIE 1931 colour space diagram. This shows that heavier doping leads to slightly more red emission of the samples. It turned out, that temperature also influences the colour coordinates slightly. They shift upwards the edge of the CIE 1931 colour space diagram indicating that phosphors give slightly more intensity in the orange spectral region at increased temperatures. On the other hand, the shift is relatively small and the colour coordinates can be considered stable within the 77–500 K range. The exact colour coordinate values in CIE 1931 colour space as a function of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration and temperature are tabulated in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Table S5</xref>, respectively. The colour coordinates of the prepared samples are virtually the same regardless of the excitation wavelength (265, 393.5 or 465 nm) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Table S4</xref>.
