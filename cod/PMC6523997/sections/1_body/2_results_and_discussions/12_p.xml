<p>To support the role of 3-CPACl in the crystal growth, the pristine material containing only the film-forming agent reveals an average crystallite size of 87 nm, which is almost three times the crystallite size of the pristine material. A detailed summary of the calculated fwhm and crystallite size for the different materials is reported in

It is important to note that the Scherrer equation gives a rough estimation of crystallite size and is only valid for particles smaller than 0.1 μm.
