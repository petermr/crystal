<p id="Par3">And yet, we still lack a full understanding of the structures of industrially relevant catalytically active surfaces, e.g, copper (Cu)

 </sup>. [Cu plays an important role in catalysis, and finds wide utility in applications, e.g., thin film growth, fabrication, and electronics.] This can be attributed to the ubiquitous morphologically rough features, viz., defects in the form of steps and vacancies, esp., if they do not exhibit order. These defects serve as active sites, exposing the incoming adsorbates to both high and low coordinated surface atoms

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. They induce changes in morphology, reactivity, energetics, and/or surface relaxation. These, in turn, affect crystal growth, oxidation, catalysis, and corrosion on the surface

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Carrying out systematic experimental/structural analyses of such surfaces pose challenges. High Miller index surfaces, which consist of a sequence of terraces (surfaces with low Miller indices) separated by periodic monoatomic steps

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, can provide access to these features and information, albeit indirectly. The surface layers, being exposed to the vacuum, would undergo varying interlayer relaxations, to compensate

 </sup> for the reduced coordination (as compared to the bulk). The interlayer relaxations would be more prominently observed for high Miller index surfaces, which are more open to the vacuum.
