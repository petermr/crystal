 <italic>μ</italic>m and Φ

  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> for a fixed density, the shift of Φ can be interpreted as the decrease of the high conductivity zone for the whole range of densities. Since 
 <italic>τ</italic> is related to the reaction zone, the shift of Φ for smaller grain size means the increase of the detonation ability

 </sup>. Small scatter of the values of Φ
 <sub>2</sub> for small grain size shows the role of hot spots the concentration of which is in this case significantly higher.
