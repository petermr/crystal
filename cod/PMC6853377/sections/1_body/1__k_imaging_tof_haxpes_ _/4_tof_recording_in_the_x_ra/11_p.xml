<p>Time-of-flight τ was determined using the model for the complete electron optics (Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>) because the upstream part of the lens system also contributes, whereas equation (2)
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd2"/> describes the drift section alone. The actual positions of the 
 <italic>nT</italic>-bands depend on the drift energy, hence variation of 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> provides a simple means to shift a higher-order contribution out of the spectrum of interest. Another way is to change the photon energy, since the ToF of the true and higher-order signals respond differently. Being much faster, the higher-order electrons are essentially unfocused and pass the microscope column as a pencil beam, confined by the apertures in the ray path [white area in Fig. 4(
 <italic>c</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref>]. The different focusing conditions offer an alternative way to suppress the higher-order (−2
 <italic>T</italic>,−
 <italic>T</italic>) contributions: a combination of apertures and (weak) deflectors can be set such that electrons with the proper energy can pass but fast electrons are blocked. The same approach works for the electrons with lower energies (+2
 <italic>T</italic>, +
 <italic>T</italic>). However, since for these low drift energies the dispersion is very large, signals from slower electrons are usually strongly spread in time and are not visible as structures in the spectra. Temporal dispersion and energy resolution are strongly different for the true and ‘
 <italic>nT</italic>-shifted’ electrons, according to equation (2)
