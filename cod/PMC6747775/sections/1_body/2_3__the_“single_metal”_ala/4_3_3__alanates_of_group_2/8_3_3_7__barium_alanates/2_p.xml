<p>Liu et al. reported a clear effect of the initial stoichiometry of the mixture on the product when a mixture of BaH
 <sub>2</sub> and Al was used as the precursor. The 2:1 and 1:1 mixtures directed the product to Ba
 <sub>2</sub>AlH
 <sub>7</sub>. Meanwhile, a 1:2 mixture directed the product to BaAlH
 <sub>5</sub> [
