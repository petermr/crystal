<p id="Par10">Once a droplet is formed, it follows a helical trajectory over several millimeters for up to 8 min. The handedness of the trajectory is constant over time and is always opposite to that of the liquid crystal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Key to the motion is the presence of a large quantity of surfactants in water, forming micelles that can solubilize small amounts of liquid crystals and thus create inhomogeneities in surface tension that are compensated by a flow that drives the droplets forward, a phenomenon known as the Marangoni effect
