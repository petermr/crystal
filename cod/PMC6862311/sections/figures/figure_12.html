 <caption> ( a– f) Spatially resolved maps of the magnitude of the normalized intensity Fourier components | I ^ l ( Q ) | of the colloidal film for l   =   2 ,   4 ,   6 at Q = Q 1 ( a, c, e) and Q = Q 2 ( b, d, f). ( g, h) Spatially resolved maps of the phase Ω l = 4 of the normalized intensity angular Fourier components I ^ l = 4 ( Q ) for Q = Q 1 ( g) and Q = Q 2 ( h) (adopted from Shroer et al.
