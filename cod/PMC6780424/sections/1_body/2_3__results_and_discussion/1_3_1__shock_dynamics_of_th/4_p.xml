<p>Generally speaking, for the energetic crystals containing CL-20 molecules, both the temperature and the pressure increased slowly at the beginning of the shock process, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Then, at ~100 fs, the temperature and the pressure started to drastically increase to higher than 1000 K and higher than 50 GPa. Next, at ~150 fs, the systems reached a gently varied stage, during which the trigger chemical bonds started to break and the decomposition reactions of material began. For the shocked insensitive explosive TATB, both temperature and pressure varied uniformly, and no chemical reactions occurred before 1000 fs, while for the shocked sensitive explosive BTF, the chemical reaction already started at 103.6 fs.
