<p>The same specimen was subsequently analyzed using APT. A detector hit map of 1 million sequentially collected ions from the centre of the dataset is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g002">Fig 2(a)</xref>. The low density features in the map clearly capture crystallographic information from each grain as well as the GB. The dominant crystallographic poles were compared to that in a stereographic projection of the crystal and have been indexed accordingly. 48.3 million ions were collected in total and reconstructed using IVAS. Crystallographic calibration [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was performed so that the resulting reconstruction was as accurate as enabled by the protocol implemented in the commercial software. The image compression factor (ICF) and field reduction factor (

 </sub>) were found to be 1.53 and 4.92 respectively. In order to more clearly show the boundary in the reconstruction, a density map, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g002">Fig 2(b)</xref>, was calculated for a 0.5nm wide slice cutting through the entire reconstruction along the 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0 plane. The inherent crystallographic information contained in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g002">Fig 2(a)</xref> was then used to directly calculate the orientation of each grain relative to the APT detector. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g002">Fig 2(c)</xref> is a stereographic projection representation of each grain. Each grain is colored according to the orientation within the IPF-Z color triangle. The colors are close to those used for the TKD IPF map but are not exactly the same due to the slightly different physical orientation of the needle within the atom probe compared to the EBSD setup. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g002">Fig 2(d)</xref> are the corresponding unit cell and Bunge-Euler notation of each grain. The disorientation angle/axis pair, which is independent of the specimen frame, was then calculated from the APT measurements and found to be 59.4Â°/[0.624, 0.555, 0.550] and is in excellent agreement with that measured from TKD.
