<p>On the other hand, the decreases in the grain size of a model increase the volume fraction of the grain boundary. The grain boundary plays an important role during the creep process of nanocrystalline NiAl. Indeed, the grain boundary deforms and slides more easily compared to grain interiors [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is not only a good source or sink place for dislocation and vacancy, but also serves as a fast path for diffusion. Therefore, the creep rate of nanocrystalline NiAl may be increased when the volume fraction of grain boundary becomes larger in a smaller grain size model.
