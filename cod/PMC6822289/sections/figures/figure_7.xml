 <caption>
  <p>Parity plots that compare the geometric properties of COFs before and after the optimization: (a) density, (b) accessible surface area, (c) largest free sphere, (d) accessible probe occupiable volume, (e) accessible probe occupiable void fraction, and (f) geometric void fraction. To determine the accessibility of the pore volume and surface, a spherical probe with radius 1.86 Å (i.e., the conventional kinetic radius of nitrogen) was considered. The “geometric” void fraction is considered as all of the portion of the pore volume that does not overlap with the atoms.
