  <title>Morphometry of the femur and evaluation of cartilage canals at the epiphysis.</title>
  <p>(A) Morphometry of the femur. Method for the measurement of femur length, ossified shaft length (OSL), femoral neck anteversion (∠FNA), femoral neck shaft angle (∠FNS), and obliquity of the shaft (∠OBS). fh-a: midpoint of the femoral head as seen from above; fh-b: midpoint of the femoral head as seen from the back; fn-a: midpoint of the femoral neck as seen from above; fn-b: midpoint of the femoral neck as seen from the back; gt: midpoint of the greater trochanter as seen from above; if: intercondylar fossa as seen from the back; lc: bottom point of the lateral condyle; le: most lateral point of the lateral epicondyle as seen from above; mc: bottom point of the medial condyle; me: most lateral point of the medial epicondyle as seen from above; pm: midpoint of the proximal metaphysis just below the lesser trochanter as seen from the back. (B) Evaluation of cartilage canals at the epiphysis. Cartilage canal formation was evaluated by counting the number of cartilage canals and dividing them into three stages (-: 0, +: 1–4, ++: &gt;5).</p>
