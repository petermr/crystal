<p>The calculation results of adsorption energy are listed in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> show large 
 <italic>E
  <sub>ads</sub>
 </italic> values of 13.46 and 7.65 eV, while the adsorption energies for Cd
 <sup>2+</sup> and Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> are quite low. Therefore, the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions are much easier to be interacted with SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs and the conclusion is in agreement with the correlation between fluorescence response and ion radius. It was concluded that the fluorescence performance is dependent on the adsorption energy of heavy metal ions. However, an inverse correlation was observed between adsorption energy and fluorescence response for Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>. It is known that the fluorescence response is the consequence of the quenching of energy emission during the transition of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band. There are several ways to release the energy, such as self-quenching, resonance energy transfer (RET), exciton coupling and photoinduced electron transfer (PET) [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Among these, PET involves the transfer of electrons between an excited fluorescence agent and a ground state species creating a charge separation [
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. When adsorbed on the site of Sn vacancy, divalent Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions may have a stronger interference to PET than trivalent Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. Therefore, the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs show a more significant fluorescence to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> even though Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> has greater adsorption energy.
