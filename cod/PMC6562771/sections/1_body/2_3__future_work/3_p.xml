<p>Secondly, in terms of the vibrations between the diamond tool and workpiece surface, their amplitudes and frequencies are always from the Fourier transformation of the original displacement signal and some of the weaker components will be omitted in the calculation process. However, to establish a more accurate surface topography model, the real-time vibration signal is recommended to be integrated into the surface topography modeling process. Meanwhile, the error components in relation to the machine tool structure and diamond tool configurations (for instance, tool overhang) deserve more attention in the topography modeling. </p>
