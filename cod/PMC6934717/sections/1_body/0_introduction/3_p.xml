 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> = 195 K or 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> = 175 K, and use X-ray and neutron diffraction, microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, and theory, to understand the reasons that give these magnetic ordering temperatures. Surprisingly, the higher 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> crystal has a broader (usually associated with strain and disorder) specific heat peak, while the lower 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> crystal has a sharp peak. How does 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> relate to lattice and topological features, and does 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> value correlate with averaged lattice parameters? Would higher 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> mean more homogeneous electronic structure? What are the pressure results for diminishing antiferromagnetism and potentially deriving superconductivity in each of these crystals? Our results show that although 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N(Fe)</sub> and 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> values are greatly sensitive to the lattice details and local arrangements of defect structures, Eu ordering is unaffected at 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N(Eu)</sub> ≈ 20 K. This study demonstrates the apparent contradictory result that certain types of disorder can significantly increase the magnetic order, even in stoichiometric quantum material.
