<p>Employing a number of computer simulation techniques, we have analyzed the intermolecular interactions between the azo–BTA stars in columns in experimentally resolved crystals [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our results suggest that during the formation of ordered phases, these molecules prefer to build 1D columns with the equilibrium distance between the star cores of 3.6
