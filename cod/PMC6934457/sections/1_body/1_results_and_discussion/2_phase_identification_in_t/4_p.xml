<p id="Par11">We used the FWHM of the X-ray diffraction peak as a parameter to classify whether a point on the combinatorial chip was amorphous or crystalline. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e,f</xref>, the FWHM changed continuously, a criterion is necessary to make the determination. The XRD spectra in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> shows a clear transition from amorphous to crystalline state. The FWHM at the transition (the broadest peak in the group, marked as A) was designated as a criterion for amorphous phase. The resulting categories (amorphous/crystalline and partial crystalline) before and after heat treatment were plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>. There is a small amorphous region near the corner of pure Ti in the as-deposited state. The amorphous region expands after heat treatment from the corner of Ti to a boundary at about 30% of Ti content. The results of the category are in good agreement with the data reported by Ludwig, as illustrated in Fig.

 </sup>, except that their data did not cover the entire ternary phase diagram. The boundary of the amorphous region in the Ni-rich side is 50% Ti, and the boundary of the Cu-rich side can be extended to about 30% Ti. In comparison, the amorphous/crystalline boundary reported by Ludwig was parallel to the edge of Ni–Cu at about 25% Ti content. The differences in the boundaries may be due to the difference in the synthesis method and the criteria for amorphous phase determination. The present results are generally in agreement with the diagram by rapid quenching method

 </sup> except that the Ti-rich corner shows crystalline state instead of amorphous state. This is due to the different amorphous formation mechanisms of the two methods.
