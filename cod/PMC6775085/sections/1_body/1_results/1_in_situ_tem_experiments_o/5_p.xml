<p id="Par10">Despite its much smaller size, the thin neck-shaped ligament can tolerate significant level of tip shake, thus can help stabilize the growth of the nanowire. Although slight shaking still occurred to the drawing tip, the ensuing growth process is quite stable (see Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>), as long as the neck-shaped ligament still sits at the bottom, as schematically depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The balance of several competing factors determines the steady-state neck shape. One is obviously the temperature distribution and the divergence of the thermomigration flux

 </sup>, which tends to narrow the neck; but the load is itself dependent on the pulling speed and the ease of GB diffusion/plating relative to the rampant surface diffusion (if there were just surface diffusion but no GB diffusion/plating, the nanowire can grow fatter but not taller, and the load cannot be relieved). Yet another factor is the surface curvature-driven smoothening process
