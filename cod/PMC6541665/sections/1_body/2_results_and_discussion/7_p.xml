 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a–c show the CIE chromaticity diagram and EL spectra of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs + 150 μm-thick QD films with and without LCD. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, it can be seen that the CIE chromaticity coordinate (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) of the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU with LCD shifted from (0.2525, 0.2284) to (0.2873, 0.3099). The 150° mini-CSPLED BLU with LCD was from (0.2478, 0.2295) to (0.2830, 0.3072). The 180° mini-CSPLED BLU with LCD was from (0.2496, 0.2331) to (0.2794, 0.3063). This shows that with the addition of LCD, the CIE chromaticity coordinates shifted more toward the white region. The EL spectrum of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs + 150-μm-thick QD films without LCD exhibits a strong blue light intensity, and the CIE chromaticity coordinate is located in the near blue region, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S4, S7, and S10). When the LCD was placed on the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs + 150 μm-thick QD films, the EL spectrum shows that the red, green, and blue light intensity were similar, and the CIE chromaticity coordinate was located in the white region. This result can be attributed to the color filter of the LCD structure, which improves the color coordinate position, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S23–S25). The inset shows the actual application photograph of 180° mini-CSPLED BLU + 150-μm-thick QD film with LCD.
