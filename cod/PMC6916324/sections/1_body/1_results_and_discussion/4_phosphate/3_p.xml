 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> For the phosphate oxygen atoms, four tetrahedrally oriented VSCCs would be expected due to the sp
 <sup>3</sup> hybridization.
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> However, the number of VSCCs could neither be resolved from MM‐Expt nor from MM‐DFT. As expected, one bonding VSCC is located near the P−O bond axis. The VSCCs in the nonbonding region pointing away from that bond are fused to a toroidal orientation. Even with full refinement of all feasible multipole parameters from theoretical data, it was impossible to resolve them. We refrained from that endeavor because it clearly indicated overfitting.
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Local mirror symmetry had to be taken into account. Additionally, the multipole population at all oxygen atoms had to be set to be the same.
