<p>Such behavior has been observed in layered manganese oxides [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and perovskite-type materials [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The sudden increment in the conductivity, above 10 Hz for Mn8 material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f007">Figure 7</xref>), most likely is due to the high quantity of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) compared to Mn4. However, Mn4 had the highest conductivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f007">Figure 7</xref>) because of its smaller crystal size and higher surface area (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The conductivity values obtained at 10 Hz were 4.1250 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> and 1.6870 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> Ω
 <sup>−1</sup>cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for Mn4 at 298 and 423 K, respectively. For Mn8, the conductivity values at this frequency were 3.7074 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> (298 K) and 3.9866 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> Ω
 <sup>−1</sup>cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (423 K).
