<p>Here, we observe the coexistence of native metallicity and ferroelectricity in bulk crystalline WTe
 <sub>2</sub> at room temperature. Bulk single crystals in their pristine state show ferroelectric domains that are visualized directly. We demonstrate that the bistable spontaneous ferroelectric polarization state is switchable under an external electrical bias and explain the mechanism for “metallic ferroelectricity” in WTe
 <sub>2</sub> through a systematic study of the crystal structure, electronic transport measurements, and theoretical considerations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the ferroelectricity is related to the anisotropy of the crystal structure. A van der Waals material that is both metallic and ferroelectric in its bulk crystalline form at room temperature has potential for new nanoelectronics applications.
