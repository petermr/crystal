<p id="p0045">The experiments to determine sorption characteristics were made by the method of limited volume at the room temperature (20±2°С). Zeolite preparation was made as follows: the sample was grinded up in a roll-jaw crusher, the fraction of 0.25–0.5 mm was separated on the sieves, washed by distilled water by decantation, dried on the air under the room temperature. Sub-samples of air-dry zeolite were placed in Ehrlenmeyer's flasks, model solutions with different concentrations of heavy metals in the ratio S:L = 1:5 were added, and placed in the shaker. In 4 h the solution was separated by filtering, and the concentration of heavy metals were determined. The experimental researches of heavy metals sorption by zeolite of Yagodnisky deposit of Kamchatka region from model solutions in the concentrations range from 0.5 up to 3.5 mg-eq/l were made. Sulfate productive solutions are formed during the oxidation of sulfide ores. Therefore, heavy metal sulfates were chosen for modeling adsorption processes. CoSO
