 <xref rid="B224-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. The second dehydrogenation step (reaction (46)) is endothermic with an enthalpy of 32 kJ/mol H
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B224-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. The reversibility of Equations (45) and (46) was not reported. The enthalpy values indicate that the first reaction is not suitable for hydrogen storage for mobile applications. However, the second reaction, in principle, could be suitable for mobile hydrogen storage. The enthalpy value of reaction (46) was used to generate the phase diagram of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02724-f016">Figure 16</xref>. The diagram indicates that CaAlH
 <sub>5</sub> could be produced at temperatures and pressures that are compatible with fuel cells, perhaps with the help of a proper catalyst. In this scenario, the reversible hydrogen storage capacity would be 4.19 wt.%.
