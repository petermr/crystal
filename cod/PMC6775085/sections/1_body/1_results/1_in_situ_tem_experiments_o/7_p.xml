<p id="Par12">Since the nanowire was mechanically pulled from the hot solid substrate like Czochralski growth, it raises a question as to how much pulling stress exists in the neck and nanowire to meet the required tip displacement rate (growth rate). To clarify this point, we adopted a high-sensitivity force transducer to measure the pulling load. The result is shown in Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, which demonstrates that the uniaxial tensile stress felt by the nanowire was only a few tens of MPa. This is much smaller than the stress required to activate dislocation plasticity in such nanowires, thus proving that dislocation plasticity are not necessary ingredients for the observed growth. Also, possible electron-beam effect on nanowire growth was also excluded, as detailed in Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. Therefore, the nanowire growth in our work was not a conventional wire drawing process.
