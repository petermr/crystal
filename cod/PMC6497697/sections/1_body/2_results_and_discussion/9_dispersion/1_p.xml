<p>The percentage of surface atoms (dispersion, FE) of the various clusters is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Platinum nanoclusters are known to have catalytic activity with respect to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which is size and shape dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This reference determined that platinum cuboctahedral clusters of 2.2 nm in size had maximal ORR activity. It is also known that for PtNi alloys the (111) surface is preferred for the ORR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We compare the icosahedral, octahedral, decahedral, and cuboctahedral clusters for FE at a 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub>=7.5 for platinum at 2.2 nm. The icosahedral, octahedral, and decahedral clusters have surfaces with (111) faces. Using the power laws in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we find for the given 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>rel</italic>
 </sub> that the FE for icosahedral clusters is 47.9%, for cuboctahedral 52.8%, and for decahedral 57.5% and that octahedral clusters have FE=58.9
 <italic>%</italic>. Thus, based on shape, the octahedral clusters have both the (111) surface and the highest value of FE for a similar size. Both the power law coefficient and exponent are relevant for the determination of FE for small 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>rel</italic>
 </sub>. The mathematical interpretation of the power law exponent gives the physical significance as the relationship of the ordinate, FE, to the abscissae, 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>rel</italic>
 </sub>, or the relative percent change of FE to the relative percent change of 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>rel</italic>
 </sub>. The power law coefficient is simply the value of FE when 
 <italic>d</italic>
