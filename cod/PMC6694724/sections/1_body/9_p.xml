<p>A large magnetocrystalline anisotropy is expected in Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn because of the tetragonal superstructure and the involvement of heavy elements Pt and Sn. We took advantage of the big single crystals and carried out directional-dependent magnetic measurements of well-oriented single crystals of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn.

 </xref>a shows the magnetization versus temperature measurements in an applied external field of 0.01 T for two crystallographic axes, namely [100] and [001], in zero field cooled and field cooled conditions. We can clearly observe a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition appearing at 392 K. On decreasing the temperature further, the sharp increase in the magnetic moment, around 170 K, is attributed to a spin-reorientation transition (

 </sup> The absence of any hysteresis in magnetization under warming and cooling conditions rules out the structural origin of this transition.
