<p>This example shows that many different aspects of a complex, modulated structure family can be studied based on the determination of superspace models from first principles as introduced in this study. The method is generally applicable to any modulated structure for which a representative commensurate case or commensurate approximation can be generated. In many cases X-ray diffraction does not allow the unambiguous interpretation of features with weak contrast like the position of atoms with very few electrons or the distinction between atoms with similar scattering power like Al and Si (Xu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb87"> ▸</xref>). These questions can be tackled by following the systematic approach based on FF calculations and more accurately with DFT calculations. Although the present example was based on commensurate cases, we do not see any obstacle to ‘extrapolating’ the modulation functions for the description of incommensurately modulated structures.
