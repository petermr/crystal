<p>Finally, it should be noted that deintercalation of Ca ions from CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> would require them to migrate in the space between the (TaN
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sup>2–</sup> layers. The simplest pathway for Ca diffusion in the structure is the octahedral–tetrahedral–octahedral hopping mechanism in the Ca layer (see

  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>C). The large calculated energy barrier (1.7 eV) is indicative of a hampered Ca diffusion. Thus, it seems that other oxidation/decomposition reactions which may involve evolution of N
 <sub>2</sub> (as suggested by the decrease in N content from 10.5 to 7.7% revealed by EDX) are likely to occur instead or concomitant to deintercalation. These would most likely be related to the progressive amorphization observed upon oxidation.
