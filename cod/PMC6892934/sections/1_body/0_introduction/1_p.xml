<p id="Par2">There is an ongoing search for plasma facing armour materials for critical components in future fusion reactors, such as the main wall and the divertor. Tungsten is a promising candidate due to its high melting point, reasonable strength at high temperatures and low sputtering yield

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Within the fusion reactor, armour components will be exposed to high temperatures (&gt;1200 K) and irradiated by high energy neutrons (14.2 MeV, ~2 dpa per year for tungsten) which will generate lattice defects

 </sup>. Foreign elements such as hydrogen isotopes and helium will accumulate within initially pure tungsten components due to transmutation and migration from the fusion plasma
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The presence of helium in tungsten is particularly worrying because of its low solubility and strong affinity for lattice defects
