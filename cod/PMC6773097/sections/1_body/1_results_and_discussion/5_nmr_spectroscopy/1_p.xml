 <sup>13</sup>C MAS NMR spectra for the as‐made products in runs to make SSZ‐26 (with isomer I) and SSZ‐27 (with isomer III). Also shown are the spectra for the two separate isomers (I and III) in the crystalline solid state and in solution. There are clear differences in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C MAS NMR spectra of the two isomers, but in both cases the lines become broader and less distinctive when they are entrapped in the SSZ‐26 and SSZ‐27 framework structures. Note that the 
 <sup>13</sup>C resonances in the crystalline solid are more complicated than those in solution phase,
