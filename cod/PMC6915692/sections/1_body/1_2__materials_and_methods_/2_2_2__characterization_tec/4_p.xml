<p>The compound structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (PANanalytical X’Pert Pro instrument Cu K
 <sub>α1</sub> = 1.54056 Å, K
 <sub>α2</sub> = 1.54439 Å and 2θ range from 8 to 80°, Almelo, NETHERLANDS). The unit cell parameters were refined by structural pattern matching using the Fullprof program package. All the patterns were analyzed using the Caglioti function, i.e., the isotropic peak profile function for which the u, v, w and shape parameters are refined.
