<p>Because of the lack of theoretical basis, the acceleration-induced effects cannot be effectively corrected. Piezoelectric pressure sensors are generally composed of piezoelectric crystal, diaphragm, anvil plate, and other components [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01052-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The diaphragm delivers pressure and preloads the crystal. When the diaphragm is under pressure, the pressure is passed to the crystal through the anvil plate, which ensures that the pressure on the crystal itself is uniform and prevents local damage from pressure concentrations [
