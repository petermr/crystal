 </sup>. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(A)</xref>, it can be seen that the PL spectrum (blue line) at 479 nm of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> overlap with the PLE spectrum (purple line) at 476 nm of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> proving existence of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> → Sm

 <sup>3+</sup> energy transfer. Emission peak at 566 nm and emission peak at 579 nm overlapped is the cause of characteristic peak at 566 nm not shown on PL spectra of Fig.
