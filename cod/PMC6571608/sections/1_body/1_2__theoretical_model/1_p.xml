<p>Schematic image of the investigated sample and formation geometry are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00861-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. A layer of PSLC or PDLC is placed between two flat parallel plates of an optically transparent material (glass, polymer, etc.). The general case of the incidence of two coherent arbitrarily polarized monochromatic light waves on the interface between the LC-PPM-air is considered.
