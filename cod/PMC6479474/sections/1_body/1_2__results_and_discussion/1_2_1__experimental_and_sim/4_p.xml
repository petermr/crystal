<p>The lower IR region (fingerprint region; 1700–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the present case; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) of melamine features rather well separated bands. The most notable group of the intense bands in the region of 1650–1430 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> primarily arises from in-plane NH
 <sub>2</sub> deformations (scissoring and rocking modes of NH
 <sub>2</sub>; in-plane ring modes and C-N(H
 <sub>2</sub>) stretching modes). The internal coordinates corresponding to these vibrations are rather highly mixed (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01402-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the bands appearing at 1194 and 1174 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> stems from relatively “clean” NH
 <sub>2</sub> rocking modes. However, the intensities of those two bands are weak. These observations will find good confirmation in the subsequent analysis of the NIR spectrum of melamine. The next band (1024 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) has a moderate intensity and it corresponds to two transitions;
