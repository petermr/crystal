<p>The optimized structure data under zero pressure are in good agreement with the values published in the previous theoretical results [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Taking into account the overestimation of the lattice constants by the GGA approximation, the results agree fairly well with the experimental values [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> phase, the Ge and Se atom sit in the Wyckoff position 4
 <italic>c</italic> (x, 1/4, z), which is fixed y = 1/4. The fractional coordinates of the Ge and Se atom are well reproduced in the present work. The Ge atom bonds with the three nearest neighbor Se atoms. The bond of the Ge–Se in the layer plane is denoted as I, and the bond nearly perpendicular to the layer plane is represented as II. In addition to the three nearest Ge–Se bonds, the Ge has two next-nearest nonbonding Se neighbors in the layer plane, indicated by III as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. The blue dashed line represents the nonbonding interlayer Ge–Ge distance. The calculated three nearest bond lengths of Ge–Se are I = 2.61 Å and II = 2.59 Å. The next-nearest bond length of Ge–Se III is 3.38 Å. The calculated bonding and nonbonding lengths display satisfactory agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical reports [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on the equilibrium structure under zero pressure, we gradually increased the hydrostatic pressure to observe the structural evolution behavior under pressure. The structural parameters of GeSe were optimized completely under different pressures. We found that the structure symmetry of GeSe changes at 34 GPa from a low-symmetry space group 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> (#62) to high-symmetry 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> (#63). The 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> space group has the same crystal axis as the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> phase group, which is a non-standard 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> (#63) space group. Both 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> and 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> occupy the 4c Wyckoff positions at (x, 1/4, z). The 4c Wyckoff positions of group 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> are (x,1/4,z), (−x + 1/2,3/4,z + 1/2), (−x,3/4,−z), and (x + 1/2,1/4,−z + 1/2). The Wyckoff positions of group 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> are (x,1/4,0), (−x + 1/2,3/4,1/2), (−x,3/4,0), and (x + 1/2,1/4,1/2). The 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> phase structure is dynamically stable at 37 GPa, as discussed below. The finding reveals that the second-order phase transition of GeSe is induced by pressure. The 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> phase at high pressure is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, which also shows a layered structure with eight atoms in a unit cell. In the 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> phase, the coordination number of each Ge atom is five, compared to three of the low-pressure 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> phase structures. The lattice parameters of the 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> phase at 37 GPa are a = 9.74 Å, b = 3.57 Å, and c = 3.68 Å. The four neighbor bond lengths of the Ge–Se in the layer plane are I = III = 2.57 Å. The bond length of the Ge–Se–II perpendicular to the layer plane is 2.44 Å. On the experimental site, Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] observed a high-symmetry 
 <italic>Bbmm</italic> phase under 40 GPa, with a = 9.65 Å, b = 3.58 Å, c = 3.61 Å, I = III = 2.56 Å, and II = 2.44 Å.
