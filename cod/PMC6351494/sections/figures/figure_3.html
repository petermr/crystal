 <caption> An SEM image (A) and an XRD pattern (B) of Mg 3Bi 2 thin film. The small peak at 22.6° of 2θ corresponds to 003 reflection of bismuth. Two strong peaks observed at 44.9 and 49.9° of 2θ are corresponding to the copper substrate. All the other peaks match with the reference pattern of Mg 3Bi 2 (ICDD PDF 04-003-6859). </caption>
