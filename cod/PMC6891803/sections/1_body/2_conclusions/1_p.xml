<p>We demonstrate the successful use of KMCS to model the growth of lithium-based vertically aligned nanocomposite films consisting of a promising LMO–LLTO cathode–electrolyte combination towards 3D solid-state batteries. For the algorithm, we applied a more realistic and low computational cost model, where a minimal number of restrictions was used for diffusion and for which the interaction energies were based on experimental RHEED measurements. The simulations, both of the individual components and of the nanocomposite VAN structures, showed good agreement with the films obtained experimentally and followed the trends for the deposition rate and temperature dependencies predicted by physical models. The simulated and experimental results show that growing at low deposition frequencies does not generate vertically aligned nanostructures, which is expected to be related to the islands formed during the initial growth stage. On the other hand, higher deposition frequencies yield comparable diffusion lengths, resulting in well-defined, but smaller, vertical nanopillars. The inverse effect is expected for variations in deposition temperature, where higher temperatures cause the formation of larger epiphyte grains. Quantitative analysis shows good agreement with respect to the evolution of nanopillar density upon changes in synthesis parameters, with a difference factor explained by the choice of energies used in the KMCS modeling to minimize the computational time. Our results demonstrate that KMCS modeling can be successfully applied to predict the nanopillar–matrix formation in lithium-based VAN films. However, to achieve optimal electrochemical functionality in the created VAN structures for energy storage, the specific crystal structure and stoichiometry have to be taken into consideration for the individual cathode and electrolyte materials, as well as for the interface formed between them.</p>
