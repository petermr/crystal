<p>Today, 3D perovskites as light absorption layer for solar cells have reached a very good PCE as high as 24.2%.[qv: 7b] However, their sensitivity to the environment, especially moisture, is a major barrier to commercialization. Considerable efforts have been made to improve their stability.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0147" ref-type="ref">147</xref> Compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites have larger exciton binding energy and better stability in the ambient environment. However, 2D layered perovskites also bring some bad characteristics. First, the existence of long‚Äêchain organic amine cation insulating layer and the unsatisfactory orientation of the inorganic layer structure will cause charge transfer problems, including charge accumulation and more charge recombination, so that the electrons and holes cannot be well separated.[qv: 22b,148] Second, as the number of layers decreases, the bandgap gradually widens, so the absorption of light is not ideal, thus resulting in a decrease in efficiency. Therefore, it is very important to achieve a balance between efficiency and stability by adjusting orientation and number of layers.
