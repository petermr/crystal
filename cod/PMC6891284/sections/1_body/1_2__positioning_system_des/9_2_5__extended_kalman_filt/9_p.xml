 </inline-formula> calculated from Equation (30) is not the optimal gain. Therefore, the traditional calculation formula for the matrix 
 <italic>P</italic> cannot be used to update the covariance matrix, and Equation (32) must be used to ensure positive-definiteness and symmetry of 
 <italic>P</italic>. This is the only way to prevent the filter from diverging, and it is also the only way to guarantee convergence.
