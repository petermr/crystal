 <caption> First-principles DFT calculations. ( A) Band structure of T d -WTe 2. ( B) Planar averaged conduction charge densities contributed from the electron pocket (top) and the hole pocket (bottom). ( C) Schematic of different distortion vectors in 1T-WTe 2. The solid straight arrows denote three equivalent distortion vectors for the polarization up states ( P up1, P up2, and P up3), while the dashed straight arrows denote three equivalent distortions vectors for the polarization down states ( P down1, P down2, and P down3). The purple curved arrows denote the possible transition paths from P up1 to P down1, involving the switching of different distortion vectors. ( D) The energy evolution between opposite polarization states of T d -WTe 2. The two opposite polarization states ( P up1 and P down1) are connected by the inversion operation (top), while the polarization down state ( P down2) has a different distortion vector, which can be obtained by application of a threefold rotation on P down1 (bottom). The energies of intermediate states are calculated using the atomic position r(α) = r up + α( r down – r up), where 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 and r up and r down are the atomic positions of P up and P down, respectively. Insets show the top views of the different states. The red dashed boxes in the insets denote the unit cell of T d -WTe 2. </caption>
