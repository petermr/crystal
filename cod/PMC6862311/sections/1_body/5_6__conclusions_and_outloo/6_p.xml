<p>In the interpretation of the AXCCA results, the most complicated part is to relate the anisotropy of the measured diffraction patterns to the actual structure of the system, especially in the 3D case. One of the possible ways to simplify this problem is to limit the number of illuminated particles, which can be obtained by focusing of the incoming beam. Focusing would also allow to perform a finer raster scan of the sample, which can provide an important structural information on the inhomogeneity of the sample, as it was demonstrated in many examples of this review. However, due to the low efficiency of the X-ray focusing optics, the high initial flux is required in order to have sufficient number of X-ray photons in the focused beam. Moreover, these photons have to be coherent in order to create the speckles on the diffraction pattern.</p>
