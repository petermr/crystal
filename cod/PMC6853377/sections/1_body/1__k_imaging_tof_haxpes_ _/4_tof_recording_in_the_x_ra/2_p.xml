<p>The high photon energies pose a challenge to high-resolution ToF spectroscopy, especially because such instruments resemble high-pass filters. Hence, one might suspect that they are not suitable for core-level studies in general due to overlap of the signal with other core levels or the valence electrons. In addition, contributions of higher-order radiation from the beamline might complicate the situation further. In this section, we discuss the circumstances under which such undesired signals appear and possible solutions for their suppression. For the given conditions (
