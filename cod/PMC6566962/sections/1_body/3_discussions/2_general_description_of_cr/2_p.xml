<p>In the present study, we determined that the η″ phase (the low-temperature phase of η-Fe
 <sub>2</sub>Al
 <sub>5</sub> with Fe-rich side compositions) possesses an orthorhombic long-period superlattice structure (space group 
 <italic>Pmcn</italic>), based on the parent orthorhombic unit cell (space group 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic>) of the η phase. The superlattice structure consists of M unit cells of the parent orthorhombic lattice stacked along the orthorhombic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis, with a peculiar ordered arrangement of Fe/Al atoms in the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites. As a result, the unit cell of the η″ phase consists of two twin-related domains alternately stacked along the orthorhombic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis with two twin boundaries at 
 <italic>z</italic> = 1/4 and 3/4, corresponding to the diagonal glide planes. Each of the twin domains is comprised of the motif structure with doubled unit cell dimension (
