 </sup> The authors argued that the strain induced by the lattice mismatch between the parent djurleite Cu

 </sub>S phase and the product wurtzite CGS phase would make Ga

 </sub>S unfavorable, thereby limiting the extent of the CE reaction and leading to wurtzite–djurleite superlattice formation as a way to minimize the resulting strain. However, we note that in the present work Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S NCs were successfully converted into homogeneous CGS NCs, despite the tensile strain resulting from insufficient contraction to the lattice parameters of fully relaxed bulk CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub>. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the NCs used here are much smaller than those used by Shim and co-workers (viz. 12 nm diameter 
 <italic>vs</italic> ∼170 nm long, 20 nm diameter rods). The smaller volume of the template NCs used in our work favors conversion to homogeneous CGS NCs because smaller NCs can more easily accommodate lattice strain. This also offers a possible explanation for the self-limiting character of the Cu

 </sub>S NC templates: the α′-Ga
