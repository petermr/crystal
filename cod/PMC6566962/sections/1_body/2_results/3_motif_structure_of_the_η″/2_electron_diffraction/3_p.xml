<p>Since the number of symmetry operations of the space group 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> (16) is twice that of 
 <italic>C</italic>2/
 <italic>m</italic> (8), the η″ phase with the space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2
 <italic>/m</italic> should have two orientation variants if it is formed from the η phase through solid–solid phase transformation upon cooling. These two orientation variants (designated as A and B) are generated by taking the principal axis (
 <italic>b</italic>-axis) of the monoclinic unit cell parallel (A) and anti-parallel (B) to the 
 <italic>a</italic>-axis of the parent orthorhombic unit cell (
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(c</xref>)). Since these two orientation variants are symmetric with each other with respect to the (001)
 <italic>
  <sub>Cmcm</sub>
 </italic> mirror plane, they are twins.
