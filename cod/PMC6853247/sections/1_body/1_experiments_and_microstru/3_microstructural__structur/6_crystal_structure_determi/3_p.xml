<p>The structure was then solved ab initio using the charge flipping algorithm, as implemented in the program Superflip (Palatinus &amp; Chapuis, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) with the chemical information provided by the EDS analysis (Mg
 <sub>1.99</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.21</sub>Si
 <sub>0.84</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>). After several cycles of calculations, SUPERFLIP found a solution with an overall agreement factor (wR) around 20%, which might be high for X‐ray data, but is a rather good value for electron diffraction data considering the remaining dynamical diffraction effects. The [100] projection of the electron density isosurface of the structure solution is presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, and its interpretation in term of atomic positions (taking into account common tetrahedral or octahedral geometries) is presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b. At this time, considering that (i) tetrahedral sites are occupied by silicon (with Si‐O distances between 1.62 and 1.70 A), (ii) “big” octahedral sites (distances between 1.98 and 2.23 A) are occupied by magnesium, and (iii) “small” octahedral site (6 distances around 1.81 A) is occupied by iron, an estimated chemical formula would be Mg
 <sub>2.333</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.167</sub>Si
 <sub>0.667</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>.
