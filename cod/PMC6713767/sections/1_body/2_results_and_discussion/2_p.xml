 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the SEM images and XRD patterns of the zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphors sintered at different temperature. From the SEM images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–d), it is clear to observe that the morphology changes significantly with the increase of the sintering temperature. When the sintering temperature is relatively lower (600 °C and 800 °C), the morphology of samples still keeps as the pristine zeolite-3A, that is, in cubic shape with an average size of 1.5 μm (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). However, it can be observed that the particles begin to aggregate when the sintering temperature reaches 1000 °C and 1200 °C. As the sintering temperature increases, the particles can continue to aggregate and form massive structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Meanwhile, their XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e. It is noticeable that the diffraction peaks of samples prepared at 600 °C and 800 °C are not absolutely indexed to the pure zeolite-3A standard card (JCPDS no. 00-019-1227). Two samples exist extra diffraction peaks located at 12.5° and 16.3°, which are assigned to the peaks of Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (JCPDS no. 00-012-0384). It means that Eu ions cannot be successfully incorporated in the zeolite host lattices when the calcination temperature is lower than 800 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, the samples sintered at above 1000 °C show peaks corresponding to the major characteristic peaks of pure zeolite-3A standard card.
