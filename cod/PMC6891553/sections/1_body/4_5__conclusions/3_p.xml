<p>Thus, we experimentally verified that (i) the permeability of these screens to sand is high, allowing its passage and avoiding the accumulation of sand at the base of these devices forming dunes, as happens in the case of classic screens; and (ii) in this new kind of barrier, the attenuation performance increases as a function of the filling factor when the sand accumulates at the base of the screens, which is unlike what happens with traditional screens, which decreases when the sand is accumulated. Although the physical reasons for this behavior are not yet known, this seems very interesting from an engineering point of view. </p>
