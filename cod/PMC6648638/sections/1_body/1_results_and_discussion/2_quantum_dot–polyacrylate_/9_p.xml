<p>However, the amount of TMSPMA added more than 5 wt % TMSPMA, the pull-off strength does not keep rising but decreases from 8.9 to 7.25 N/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 10 wt % TMSPMA. The enhancement is just 16.9% higher compared to that (6.2 N/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) without the addition of TMSPMA. This is because TMSPMA is a monofunctional monomer. When the addition of TMSPMA is increased higher than 5 wt %, the polymer chains formed by photopolymerization is not long as that of 5 wt % TMSPMA addition. It is worth noting that the addition of 5 wt % TMSPMA has no significant effect on the transparency of the hybrid film and the light extraction efficiency of white LEDs.
