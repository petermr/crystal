<p>Solution ion activities and saturation states with respect to different solid phases were modeled using the PHREEQC geochemical program from the USGS.

 </sup> The solutions were modeled using the Lawrence Livermore National Library (llnl) database. None of the databases available with PHREEQC contain thermodynamic parameters for the Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> phase zabuyelite and had minimum interaction coefficients for Li ion pairs. Therefore, these simulations are used mainly to evaluate the supersaturation of the system with respect to secondary mineral precipitates including Mg-, Ca-, K- and Na-carbonate phases and Na-carbonate ion pairs.
