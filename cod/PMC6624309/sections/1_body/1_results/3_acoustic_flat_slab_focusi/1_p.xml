<p id="Par13">There is always a phase difference π between the left- and right-reflected waves when the transmittance is greater than 1. It can be utilized to frame two units of metamaterials, which can realize the discrete phase gradient of π that covers the full range of 2π. Using the above structure and parameters, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref> shows two units of 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric metamaterials. Due to different arrays of gain and loss mediums, the reflected waves of two units correspond to the left and right reflected waves, respectively. Here, the lattice length 
 <italic>a</italic> is 1 cm. To clearly exhibit the discrete phase shifts, as plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>, the pressure distribution of reflected waves at the left edge of each unit is independently calculated with free space wavelength λ = 3.5
 <italic>a</italic>. At this wavelength, the reflection amplitudes in two units are nearly equal, which are approximately 3/5 of the amplitude of the incident wave. The pressure strips are obviously shown, and there is a shift of λ/2, i.e., the π phase between adjacent peaks of two reflected waves, so that two such unit structures can shift up to provide a discrete phase gradient for the entire 2π range.
