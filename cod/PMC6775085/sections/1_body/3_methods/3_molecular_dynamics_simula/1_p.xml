 <sub>w</sub> = 8 nm, Φ
 <sub>n</sub> = 5 nm) consist of 187,102 atoms was used, which contains tilt grain boundary as shown in Fig.

 </sup> was used for interatomic interaction. The regions above necking and below the substrate surface were maintained constant temperature of 127 °C (400 K) and 527 °C (800 K), respectively. Thus the temperature gradient at necking region was estimated at ~6.3 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> K/m. Ten nanoseconds of MD simulations were run with and without pulling load along axial direction. The applied load corresponds to nanowire pulling stress of 274 MPa.
