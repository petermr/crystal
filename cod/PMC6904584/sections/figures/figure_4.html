 <caption> Mechanism of PLQE enhancement by YCl 3. a ICP measurement results that show the Y/Pb ratios in the different locations of the crystal. The crystal (inset) was cleaved into thin pieces (1â€“4) and Y/Pb ratio of each piece was measured. b Schematic illustration of the yttrium gradient distribution in the CsPbBr 3:PEACl (1:1) film and its function in increase the bandgap around the grain surface. Absorption ( c) and PL ( d) of CsPbBr 3 films with or without YBr 3. e XPS measurement results that show the Y/Pb ratios on the surface of CsPbBr 3:PEACl (1:1) films with different YCl 3 ratios of 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. The Y/Pb ratios on the film surface is higher than the corresponding Y/Pb ratios in the precursor solutions. f DFT-calculated PDOS of CsPbBr 3 with YCl 3. </caption>
