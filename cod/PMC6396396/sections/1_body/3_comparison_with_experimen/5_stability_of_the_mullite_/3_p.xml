<p>The unified superspace model explains many details of the structural dependence on the composition and presents the underlying mechanisms of vacancy and Al/Si ordering. Some of the commensurate cases investigated here represent structural turnover points: for 
 <italic>x</italic> &lt; 0.2 the block structure begins to dissolve as a certain fraction of vacancy blocks disappears. 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1/3 is a special case because of its layer structure and 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 marks the endmember of the unified superspace model for which dicluster–vacancy chains disappear. For 
 <italic>x</italic> &gt; 0.5 a new superspace model is required, in full agreement with the observation of a lowering of the symmetry to monoclinic above 
 <italic>x</italic> ≃ 0.5 (Ylä-Jääski &amp; Nissen, 1983
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb89"> ▸</xref>). Independent of the superspace model tetraclusters are present for 
 <italic>x</italic> &gt; 2/3. The observed borders of the solid solution range do not correspond to any of the above-mentioned turnover compositions. Hence, the vacancy distribution predicted by the superspace model cannot explain the phase diagram and a different explanation is needed.
