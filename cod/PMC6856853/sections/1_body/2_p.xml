<p>Recently, we investigated the usage of single‐source precursors for the synthesis of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles and could show that complexes containing only labile CO ligands and hydrogen substituents on phosphorus are suitable precursors for the synthesis of size‐ and stoichiometry‐controlled nanoparticles.
 <xref rid="anie201909423-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> This was demonstrated by the synthesis of FeP nanoparticles with a precise stoichiometry control by starting from the single‐source precursor [Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub>(PH
 <sub>3</sub>)] or [{Fe(CO)
 <sub>3</sub>}
 <sub>2</sub>(μ‐PH
 <sub>2</sub>)]

 <xref rid="anie201909423-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Targeting the corresponding As‐containing complexes, we realized that the synthetic pathway for this kind of compounds goes totally different ways and, to our surprise, we achieved the synthesis of the unprecedented diarsene iron carbonyl complex [Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub>(η
 <sup>2</sup>‐As
 <sub>2</sub>H

 <bold>2</bold>)—a complex without sterically demanding ligands—in which the diarsene ligand is only stabilized in the coordination sphere of one transition metal. Additionally, reactivity studies towards Lewis acids show that 
 <bold>2</bold> can serve as a source of AsH units, resulting in novel complexes, such as [{Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub>}AsH{W(CO)
 <sub>5</sub>}]
 <sub>2</sub> (
