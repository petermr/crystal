<p>To address this question and probe ferroelectricity in WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, we used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to spatially map the polarization. PFM is a standard technique used extensively to investigate domain microstructure and dynamics of polarization in classical ferroelectric materials. It exploits the converse piezoelectric effect and detects lattice deformation due to an applied electric field (

 </xref>). To ensure pristine surfaces for the investigation, we prepared freshly cleaved WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single-crystal samples (several tens of micrometers thick; 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>, and see Materials and Methods for details). Measurements were performed in an inert dry N
 <sub>2</sub> environment at room temperature immediately after the crystals were cleaved. In this experiment, the conductive nanoscale tip acts as a movable top electrical contact. Spectroscopic electrical transport measurements performed using conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) reveal the expected metallic behavior of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> and establish the ohmic nature of the electrical contacts (see fig. S1). The measured current-bias curves are linear and show appreciable conduction over a rather small bias range. Subsequently, we performed PFM imaging (see Materials and Methods for details). The PFM images (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C to H</xref>) show the presence of antiparallel ferroelectric domains. A few of these domains are visualized in more detail in the high-resolution PFM images (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). The domains usually exhibit a distorted circular profile with an average domain size in the range of ~20 to 50 nm. The domain shape resembles those of well-known ferroelectric materials such as strontium bismuth tantalate (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, J and K</xref>): (i) Domain walls appear as dark lines (i.e., as a minimum in the PFM amplitude signal) in the amplitude image, and (ii) the PFM phase inverts by ~180Â° between adjacent domains in the corresponding phase image. The surface of the sample is atomically flat (root mean square roughness, ~0.2 nm) with occasional step edges (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) from the cleaving process. We note that, in some but not all cases, submonolayer surface variations close to the resolution limit of our measurement system were observed near the position of the domains (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). In addition to the small oval domains, micrometer-sized stripe-like domains (shown by arrows in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) were also resolved. This observation of domains in semimetallic WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals implies that WTe
 <sub>2</sub> not only has a polar axis (
 <italic>c</italic> axis) but also has bistable polarization states manifesting as static antiparallel domains. Therefore, the above results strongly support the existence of ferroelectricity in semimetallic WTe
 <sub>2</sub> at room temperature.
