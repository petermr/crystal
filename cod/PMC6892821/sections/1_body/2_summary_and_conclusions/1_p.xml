<p id="Par15">The results presented in this work demonstrate the ability of 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> methods for solid-state theory to unveil the fundamental physical properties of photocathode materials. By adopting state-of-the art approaches based on all-electron DFT and MBPT in the 
 <italic>GW</italic> approximation, we have computed the electronic properties of three alkali antimonides materials for photocathodes, namely Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb, Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb, and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb. A quantitative estimate of the band gap has revealed that all these systems are characterised by rather low quasi-particle band gaps, ranging from 0.57 eV in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb to 1.62 eV in CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb. The character of the band gap changes depending on the relative content of potassium, being direct at

 </sup>) and conduction bands with relevant contributions from both Cs and and Sb 
 <italic>s</italic> states at lower energies, and from Cs 
 <italic>d</italic> states further away from the Fermi energy. The analysis of the binding energies of the core states shows regular patterns in the shifts associated to individual atomic species in specific crystallographic sites. In particular, our DFT results indicate sizable shifts, of the order of 2 eV and 0.5 eV, for K 2
 <italic>p</italic> and Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic> states between Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb. These trends can be used to identify correlations between 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> theory and measurements on bi-alkali antimonide photocathode samples. In this regard we have shown the result of XPS characterization measurements performed on a set of Cs-K-Sb photocathodes prepared for the bERLinPro project. The XPS survey spectra of the grown samples reveal non-stroichiometric compositions as well as the presence of oxygen contaminants, which in turn determine the oxidation states of the Sb species. Finally, we have shown how the stoichiometry and the chemical composition of the cathodes, including their relative oxygen content, is related to the measured QE.
