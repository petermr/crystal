  <p>Surface profiles of the nano-indents; (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>) as obtained through CPFE formulation for the unimplanted and the helium-implanted tungsten sample respectively, (
   <bold>c</bold>) and (
   <bold>d</bold>) as obtained through AFM measurements for the unimplanted and helium-implanted tungsten sample respectively. (
   <bold>e</bold>) and (
   <bold>f</bold>) show line profiles of surface height extracted along &lt;110&gt; and &lt;100&gt; directions respectively for the unimplanted and implanted material. Also shown are the surface profiles predicted by CPFE.
