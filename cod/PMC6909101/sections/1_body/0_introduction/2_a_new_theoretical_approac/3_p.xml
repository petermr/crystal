<p id="p0015">Only a draft of the problem is outlined in the introduction. Later sections will include a detailed discussion on both the qualitative and quantitative levels. This section presents the main application results concerning the new approach proposed by the author in theory. This presentation differs from the generally accepted style, in which the theory is first presented and then its applications to the experiment are demonstrated. This is because most new results have already been published [

This article is based on publications and reports demonstrating the success of the new theory in applications to the experiment to discuss the new problem, that has arisen in physics, at a deeper physical level and provide a regular exposition of the theory in elementary electron transfers in condensed matter. There are two main reasons for simplifying this problem [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The first involves approximating the electron's Green's function by it in the case of a free electron. The second is related to considering merely non-local vibrations of nuclei and disregarding their local vibrations.
