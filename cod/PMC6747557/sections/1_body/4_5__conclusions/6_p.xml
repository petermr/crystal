<p>(5) The conductivity mechanism for the four different densities of polyethylene in the high field has a transition process from the Poole–Frenkel effect to the Schottky effect. Moreover, with the increase of the polyethylene’s crystallinity, the threshold of field strength corresponding to the transformation of the conductivity mechanism increases gradually.</p>
