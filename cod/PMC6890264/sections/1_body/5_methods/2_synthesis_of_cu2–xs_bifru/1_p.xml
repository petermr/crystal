 <sub>2</sub>O, 6 mL of OA, and 7.5 mL of DDT were brought into a three-neck round-bottom flask, connected to a Schlenk line. Under constant stirring and nitrogen atmosphere, the mixture was heated to 200 °C at a rate of about 30 °C/min. After reaction for 2 h at 200 °C, the mixture was allowed to cool to approximately 110 °C, when it was quenched by injection of 5 mL of toluene. The product was precipitated by addition of a mixture of methanol and butanol as nonsolvent and isolated by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the residue was redispersed in toluene. The mass of product was estimated by weighing the empty sample vials prior to sample retrieval and after removal of the supernatant. The amount of toluene used to redisperse the particles was chosen such that a concentration of approximately 20 g/L was obtained.
