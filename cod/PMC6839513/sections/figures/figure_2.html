 <caption> Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction pattern of phenytoin form II. Yellow spots are the high intensity Bragg peaks of phenytoin except the labeled peak at q p = 15 and q z = 12 nm â€“1, which originates from the silicon substrate. The white circles represent calculated structure factors whereby the radius is directly proportional to its values. </caption>
