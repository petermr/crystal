<p>The change of the electronic structure in the excited PtPOP molecules leads to contraction of the Pt-Pt bond approximately by 0.24 Ã…. This contraction can be readily detected on the difference signal images which are created by subtracting an X-ray diffraction pattern from non-excited molecules in the ground state from an X-ray diffraction pattern from the partially excited ensemble of molecules. Thus, the difference diffraction images contain only the signal from changes in the PtPOP molecules upon excitation and their interaction with the solvent. To study the dynamics of the photoexcited molecules, approximately
