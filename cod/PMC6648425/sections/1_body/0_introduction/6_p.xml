<p>In the present study, our aim is to figure out the microscopic pathway of oxygen diffusion in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>. We perform the first-principles density functional calculations with the Hubbard-
 <italic>U</italic> correction method. We first look at how cobalt spin ordering and oxygen vacancy influence the magnetic and electronic properties of PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>, and the experimental and theoretical observations in literatures are discussed for comparison. Oxygen diffusion is then investigated in terms of migration energy barrier based on convincing magnetic and crystal structures. One thing should be emphasized here is that our calculations consider one extra oxygen atom to elucidate more practical situation, which is the oxygen diffusion through the oxide in fuel cell devices. Previous computational studies have examined how the oxygen vacancy migrates, instead of oxygen atoms externally injected, by maintaining the chemical composition of the host oxides.
