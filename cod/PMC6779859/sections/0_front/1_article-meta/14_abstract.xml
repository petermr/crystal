 <p>Quantum bits (qubits) constitute the most elementary building-blocks of any quantum technology, where information is stored and processed in the form of quantum superpositions between discrete energy levels. In particular, the fabrication of quantum processors is a key long-term goal that will allow us conducting specific tasks much more efficiently than the most powerful classical computers can do. Motivated by recent experiments in which three addressable spin qubits are defined on a potential single-molecule quantum processor, namely the [Gd(H

  <sup>12âˆ’</sup> polyoxometalate, we investigate the decohering effect of magnetic noise on the encoded quantum information. Our state-of-the-art model, which provides more accurate results than previous estimates, show a noticeable contribution of magnetic noise in limiting the survival timescale of the qubits. Yet, our results suggest that it might not be the only dephasing mechanism at play but other mechanisms, such as lattice vibrations and physical movement of magnetic nuclei, must be considered to understand the whole decoherence process.
