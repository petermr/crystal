<p>The above studies represent a continuation of our earlier demonstration of NO uncaging by 980 nm photoexcitation of poly(dimethylsiloxane) PDs containing the RBS as the photoNORM and Î²-NaYF
 <sub>4</sub>:Er/Yb/Gd@NaYF
 <sub>4</sub> UCNPs as the NIR activator.

 </sup> Although the latter investigation showed that such NIR photoactivation could indeed be effected through tissue filters, the inclusion of Nd
 <sup>3+</sup> in the core and shell of the Nd-UCNPs used here allows the application of 794 nm excitation and thus avoids potential heat damage owing to the modest absorbance by water at 980 nm.
