<p id="Par5">The unknown phase appears as a part of a polyphase assembly of metastable phases that evolve during devitrification of an amorphous Al-9.7% Sm melt spun ribbon. The existence of common Sm-centered first-shell packing motifs in each of these LUC crystal structures (
 <italic>ε</italic>, 
 <italic>θ</italic>, and 
 <italic>η</italic> phases) provides clear evidence for the critical role of structural hierarchy in complex phase selection in Al-Sm alloys. The structural hierarchy is referred to as the similarity of Sm-centered short-range order between a phase and its successor phase along the devitrification pathway starting from glass. In this picture, specific short-range packing motifs which contribute to glassy behavior in undercooled liquids and amorphous solids also serve as precursors for particular crystalline phases that appear during initial stages of devitrification.
