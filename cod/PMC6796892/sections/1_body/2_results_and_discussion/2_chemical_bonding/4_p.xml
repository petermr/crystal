<p>Charge transfer distribution shows isotropic nature at the Pb and O sites (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>b) in the cubic phase confirming the ionic bonding between Pb and O. The anisotropic nature of charge transfer distribution between V and O indicates the presence of finite covalent bonding between these atoms in the cubic phase. The charge transfer distribution between V and O as well as between Pb and O in tetragonal phase shows anisotropic behavior, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>b, indicating the presence of finite covalent bonding between them. It may be noted that although the covalency between Pb and O is weaker than that between V and O in the tetragonal phase, it has equal importance in the structural and ferroelectric properties.
