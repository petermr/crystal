<p>On the basis of this work, we have a preliminary understanding of the influence of the charge-characteristic of Ca-montmorillonite on water molecules and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. In the future, we will conduct an in-depth study on the influence mechanism of the charge density of Ca-montmorillonite on the polarity of the Siâ€“O surface [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, we will further study the structure, performance, and application characteristics of organo-modified montmorillonite by means of MD. The conclusions about the influence mechanism of layer charge characteristics on the distribution characteristics of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in Ca-montmorillonites interlayer space will give us useful information about the interlayer of montmorillonite at the atomic level.
