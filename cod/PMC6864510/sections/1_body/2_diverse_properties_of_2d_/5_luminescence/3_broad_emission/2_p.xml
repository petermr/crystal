<p>Different from the (001) 2D perovskites with a narrow emission, the corrugated (110) perovskites show a broad emission that spans the entire visible region. According to the corrugation length, these structures can be defined as “
 <italic>n</italic> × 
 <italic>n</italic>”, where 
 <italic>n</italic> stands for the number of octahedra in one unit. In the present study, the most common structure is 2 × 2, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c. The corrugation lengths with “3 × 3”

 <sub>4</sub> prepared by the Kanatzidis's group.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">109</xref> Such a large distorted structure results from the special “chelating effect” of hydrogen bond interactions. α‐[NH
