<p>Based on computational analysis (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), we conclude that the preferred affinity of BrQ toward the hemozoin crystal surface is likely due to a stereospecific match and attraction between the quinoline molecule and the large {100} side faces and fast-growing {011} and {001} end faces. An essentially homogeneous 10% surface coverage by BrQ should certainly inhibit crystal growth since any oncoming heme dimer will be within 2 unit cell distances of an adsorbed BrQ molecule, and so susceptible to forces unfavorable for docking at a regular surface lattice site on the hemozoin crystal. Such an inhibition would lead to accumulation of the chemically aggressive heme liberated from hemoglobin, resulting in poisoning of the parasite.
