<p id="Par6">The proposed method for growing metallic nanowires is illustrated in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In this method, three preconditions are required: The first is a hot solid reservoir free of confinement from surface oxide

 </sup>, which can be attained by scratching the pulling tip on the hot aluminum substrate to break the native oxide layer and expose fresh metal; The second is the sharp temperature gradient to induce thermomigration, which is achieved by touching a cold nanoscale tip with the hot metal reservoir: this nucleates a small seed that often has a different crystal orientation from the hot metal reservoir beneath; The third one is the mechanical pulling movement to enlarge the seed, and later sustain it as steady-state nanowire growth, with a neck-shaped region bridging the nanowire and the substrate. Again, we emphasize that the metal grown does not inherit the crystal orientation of the hot substrate beneath, and within the neck region there exists a grain boundary (GB); Plating into the GB feeds the growth of the upper, colder crystal, as the newly arrived atoms choose to deposit onto the colder side of the GB and take the lattice orientation of the new crystal. This allows the new crystal to grow taller and taller. Simultaneously, there are curvature-driven
