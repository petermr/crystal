<p id="Par28">There are 55 samples out of the confusion matrix diagonal. The 20 samples wrongly classified as liquid were distributed between 180 K and 240 K. Likewise the 35 structures wrongly classified as amorphous solid were spread from 170 K to 250 K. Summarizing, the Random Forest model built with 10% of the available MMC configurations was appropriate for classifying the remaining 90% of the configurations into the three classes that originated from the unsupervised clustering analysis: crystal, amorphous solid, and liquid. Our results demonstrate explicitly the power of machine learning in estimating thermodynamic behavior and simultaneously providing valuable guidance to machine learning of metal alloys condensed phases.</p>
