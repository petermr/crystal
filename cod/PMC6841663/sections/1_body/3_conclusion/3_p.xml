<p id="Par22">The above analyses were performed automatically, systematically, and independent of previous knowledge using ML. This means that ML-LSA can overcome the difficulty of manually identifying the specific order parameter for the classification of complex structures. ML-LSA has strong potential for classifying the structures of other complex chemical and biological molecular systems. In future studies, the capabilities of ML-LSA will be intensively evaluated.</p>
