<p>The calculated band structures, density of states (DOSs) and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) of LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02667-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The valence band maximum (VBM) is at the K point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the Γ point. According to this calculation, LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl is a wide-gap insulator with an indirect band gap. The top valence bands are dominated by Cl 3p and O 2p orbitals (~98%) and exhibit small dispersion, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-02667">Figure S2</xref>. Besides, the composition of the lowest unoccupied bands at the Γ point are made up of Cl 3s and O 2s orbitals (~59.2%) of an antibonding nature. The contribution of the other orbitals to the lowest unoccupied bands at the Γ point are relatively low, with Li 2s (~3.9%), Al 3s (~13.9%), O 2p (~9.2%), H 1s (~4.6%), and H 2p (~9.2%) orbitals.
