<p id="Par11">Experimental investigations have been carried out to examine the thermal properties of metallic nanoplates. For examples, in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) results combined with other structural analyses show that Au nanoplates present (110) facets around the edges consisting of the most unstable atoms, and fragmentation occurs upon heating [

Alternatively, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, as an ideal tool, can present direct images about the shape transformations at the resolution of atomic level. Accordingly, we performed the MD calculations on metallic nanoplates to disclose their morphology change mechanisms by describing the curving and buckling process involved. Metals with body-centered-cubic (bcc) lattices are addressed because relevant understanding on their shape stability is still lacking despite their common existence in experiments [
