<p>The calculated magnetic moment at the V site is 0.93 μ
 <sub>B</sub> for the ferroelectric phase. The covalency present between V and O induces a magnetic moment of 0.05 μ
 <sub>B</sub> at the O site. The orbital magnetic moment at the V site evaluated using the SO + OP method is estimated to be −0.045 μ
 <sub>B</sub>. This indicates that the orbital magnetic moment is aligned antiparallelly with the spin magnetic moment. The magnitude of the orbital moment of PVO is almost 5 times less than that of BiCoO
 <sub>3</sub>.

 </sup> This is due to the presence of relatively larger spin moment and stronger spin–orbit coupling in BiCoO
 <sub>3</sub>.
