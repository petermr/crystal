 <caption> Nanowire twin superlattice. (a) BF TEM image of a typical TSL nanowire investigated in this study. (b) Relation between position along the NW in (a) and extracted TSL period. (c) Schematic of a twin plane where spheres of different colors represent different types of atoms. (d) BF TEM image acquired at the top of the NW displayed in (a). (e) HAADF STEM image acquired in the position marked by the red square in (d). The red triangles indicate the position of the twin planes. The measured twin period is 32.6 nm. (f) BF high-resolution TEM image acquired at the bottom of the NW displayed in (a). (g) HAADF STEM image acquired in the position marked by the red square in (f). The red triangles indicate the position of the twin planes. The measured twin period is 11.4 nm. (h) Three-dimensional atomic reconstruction of a model TSL nanowire with six TSL periods. </caption>
