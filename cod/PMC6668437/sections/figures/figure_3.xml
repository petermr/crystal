 <caption>
  <p>Fermi surface arc. 
   <bold>a</bold> High-precision Fermi surface map of YbMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> at 
   <italic>hν</italic> = 20.5 eV showing unusual number of features (brown lines) which can be explained by the presence of the arc (dotted line) corresponding to the surface states connecting the Weyl points (green points). 
   <bold>b</bold> Spectra corresponding to cut #1 shown in panel (
   <bold>a</bold>) by white arrow (
   <italic>hν</italic> = 20.5 eV). White curve is the momentum-distribution curve at the Fermi level showing the presence of six crossings. The inner ones are due to the arc. 
   <bold>c</bold> Same as in (
   <bold>b</bold>) but for 
   <italic>hν</italic> = 27 eV. 
   <bold>d</bold> Zoomed in fragments of panels (
   <bold>b</bold>) and (
   <bold>c</bold>) as well as similar data for other photon energies. 
   <bold>e</bold> High-precision Fermi surface map of EuMnBi
   <sub>2</sub>. 
   <bold>f</bold> Spectra along the cut #2 indicated by white arrow in (
   <bold>e</bold>). Photon energy is 27 eV. No sign of the arc is present in the data
