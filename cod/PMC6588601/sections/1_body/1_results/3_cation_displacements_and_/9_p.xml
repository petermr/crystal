<p id="Par20">We also applied IFT to the calculated diffuse-scattering peaks at the ½½0-type locations (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), the so-called M-points, which previously have been attributed to local ordering of antiparallel cation displacements that signify antiferroelectric interactions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. The analysis of these weak peaks is complicated because they reside on a large background and overlap with the diffuse-intensity tails that extend from the Bragg reflections (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Nevertheless, by zooming in on the locations of the Pb atoms that exhibit the largest variation of the IFT amplitude associated with the M-points, we could identify the nanoscale antiparallel ordering of the 〈100〉 Pb-displacement components (depicted schematically in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). This ordering differs from the model with antiparallel 〈110〉 Pb displacements proposed in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>; however, we could not discriminate the background effects sufficiently to visualize the entire population of such ordered clusters responsible for the M-points and, therefore, the presence of several types of displacement patterns cannot be ruled out.
