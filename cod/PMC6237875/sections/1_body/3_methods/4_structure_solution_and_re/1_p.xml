<p id="Par32">Coesite-IV has a triclinic symmetry, and data completeness of a single dataset was not enough to solve the crystal structure. In order to increase data completeness, we created a combined reflection file from two 
 <italic>hkl</italic>-files (obtained from datasets collected at 29.9(6) and 40.2(7) GPa) using program XPREP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. Then the structure could be successfully determined by the direct method using SHELXS
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> software. After the structure solution, most of the atoms were found and the rest of them were located from a series of difference Fourier map cycles. The obtained model was used for the refinement of the structure in the individual datasets. The crystal structure was refined against

 <sup>2</sup> on all data by full-matrix least squares with the SHELXL

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> software. The crystal structure of coesite-IV was refined at 35.9(7), 40.2(7), 44.2(4), and 49.3(8) GPa. At the other pressure points, the structure refinement was not possible due to weakness of the diffraction data.
