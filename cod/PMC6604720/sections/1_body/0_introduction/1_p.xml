<p>Interior lighting is an integral part of civilization, and its development has evolved toward the design of more energy efficient technologies [

 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Today, light-emitting diode (LED)-based white light generation plays a role in both academic and industrial applications. To obtain white light through LED-based configurations, either all three primary colors (red–green–blue (RGB)) can be integrated individually via LED chips or various luminescent materials can be used as color conversion layers over blue or UV LED chips [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this sense, phosphors are commonly used luminescent materials applied as color conversion layers due to their optical features and high stability [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among those, cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>) is a well-known yellow phosphor that is employed in an LED package together with a blue LED to create a white light LED (WLED) [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In such a case, the blue light emitted from the blue LED impinges on the phosphor-containing color conversion layer. Some portion of the blue light is absorbed by the phosphor and yellow emission is produced. Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the blue light escapes from this layer. The combination of the escaped blue light and the produced yellow emission from the phosphor from the conversion layer results in the generation of white light.
