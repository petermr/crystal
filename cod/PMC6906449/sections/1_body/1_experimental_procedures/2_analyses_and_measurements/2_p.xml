<p id="Par7">The Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities were evaluated by using ZEM-3 under a helium atmosphere at a temperature ranging from ~RT to ~820 K, with an uncertainty of &lt;5.0% for each. The thermal diffusivities were measured by using TC-1200RH, with an uncertainty of &lt;10.0%. The heat capacities (

 <sub>p</sub> = 3
 <italic>n</italic>R (here 
 <italic>n</italic> is the number of atoms per formula unit and 
 <italic>R</italic> is the gas constant). The C
 <sub>p</sub> estimation is used in AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> or its related systems by many works
