<p>Let us recall that 
 <bold>1</bold> is a charged molecule, which requires the presence of counter-ions to properly balance the overall charge. Thus, the single crystal is composed of several copies of 
 <bold>1</bold> surrounded by water molecules and potassium cations acting as counter-ions, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. Importantly, the single crystal is composed of chemical elements that present a high occurrence of isotopes with magnetic nuclei. Namely, tungsten (14%, 
 <italic>I</italic> = 1/2) and phosphorus (100%, 
 <italic>I</italic> = 1/2) atoms in the polyoxometalate cage, hydrogen atoms (100%, 
 <italic>I</italic> = 1/2) in water molecules, and potassium cations (100%, 
 <italic>I</italic> = 3/2), where 
 <italic>I</italic> is the isotope nuclear spin quantum number. This bath of magnetic nuclei generates an extra magnetic noise which adds to that of the Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ion bath and, of course, can also affect quantum information, i.e., limit
