<p>This article represents the outcome of synthesis and studies of the structural and optical properties of nanoparticles CeO
 <sub>2</sub>-Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, obtained by chemical synthesis and further thermal annealing in an oxygen-containing medium. The distinction of this work from previous studies is the combination of methods of chemical synthesis allowing us to obtain oxide forms of nanoparticles with heat treatment. That enables, changing the annealing temperature, to control phase transformations and crystalline and magnetic properties [
