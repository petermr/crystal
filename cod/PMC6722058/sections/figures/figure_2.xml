   </sub> is the selected bond angle between S-atom and the two nearest neighbour Au-atoms. Criteria for the S–Au–S and S–Ag–S bond angles (
   <italic>α</italic>) close to 180 degrees are used for adding or recognizing the atoms in a linear SR–Au–SR and SR–Ag–SR conformations and 120 degrees for three-coordinated Ag–S complexes. Spatial fitting of ligands is tested with a rigid sphere (red dashed circles) in a perpendicular direction to the two nearest neighbor Au-S bonds of each S-atom and parallel to Au–P bond for phosphines. Distance of the sphere from the binding site S-atom is also defined. Here, the sphere mimicks the first CH
   <sub>2</sub> group of phenyl ethane thiol SCH
   <sub>2</sub>CH
   <sub>2</sub>Ph and the whole Ph
   <sub>3</sub> group for PPh
   <sub>3</sub> ligand.
