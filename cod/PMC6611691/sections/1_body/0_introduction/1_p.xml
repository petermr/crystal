<p>Magnetoresistance (MR) effects have been of immense interest in the condensed matter community in recent years, with the observation of colossal or extreme MR in topological semimetals (

 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>6</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). In this work, we report the discovery of a previously unidentified phenomenon in the magnetoresistive response of a one-dimensional (1D) metal whereby the angle dependence of the MR decouples from the crystalline axes. In essence, this emergence of an asymmetric MR can be ascribed to a crossover from an angular MR that is determined by the itinerant plane waves associated with the 1D Fermi surface aligned with the reciprocal lattice vectors, to one in which the local atomic basis becomes the new paradigm.
