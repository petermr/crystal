<p>Building upon these theoretical advances, a recent work (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) showed that pure bismuth hosts a second-order band topology that is protected by threefold rotational and inversion symmetries. As a result, it supports 1D topological hinge states in a crystal whose shape preserves the threefold rotational and inversion symmetries. Here we show that the band topology of bismuth is even richer in that it also hides a first-order TCI state, which is protected by its twofold rotational symmetries, resulting in a pair of unpinned topological Dirac surface states on its
