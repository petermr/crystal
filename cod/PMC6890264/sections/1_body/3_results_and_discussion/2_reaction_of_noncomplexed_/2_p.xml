<p>To determine the nature of the low contrast region and its position within the particles, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) tomography measurements were performed. Visualizations of the 3D reconstructed volumes of NCs after different reaction times are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>. Animated versions of the tomograms are also provided in the web-enhanced movies 1, 2, and 3. The tomography measurements show that, after 15 min of reaction with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>, a small cavity is present at the surface of some Cu
 <sub>2–

 </sub>S NCs (

 </xref>a) and increases in size as the reaction progresses (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>

 </xref>d–f. These measurements indicate that the brighter regions observed in TEM images coincide with cavities at the surface of the NCs. The cavities appear to form at the 
 <italic>surface</italic> of the NCs at early reaction stages and subsequently grow inward over time. A small portion of the NCs (indicated by red arrows in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>) appears to be hollow, without an obvious opening at the surface.
