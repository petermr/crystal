<p id="Par22">SALON is a red-emitting phosphor with a formerly unknown host structure. It is the only known oxonitridolithoaluminate, exhibits a high degree of condensation, and shows a unique, highly symmetrical Sr
 <sup>2+</sup> coordination, incorporating distinct nitrogen and oxygen sites. SALON exhibits an exceptionally narrow-band red emission with

 <sub>max</sub> approximately equal 614 nm and a FWHM of 48 nm, already fulfilling the future standard industrial requirements for a phosphor material in high energy efficiency white pc-LED applications. The most probable reason for the narrow emission band of SALON is the high local symmetry around the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> activator position in the crystal structure as the ordered arrangement of four oxygen and four nitrogen atoms is forming a cube-like coordination polyhedron. This highly symmetrical coordination is expected to be the reason for the narrow emission as a result of a more isotropic structural relaxation of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in its excited state, which reduces the number of energetically different states involved in the emission process. All of SALON’s intrinsic characteristics, which are relevant for application, namely a quantum efficiency of greater than 80%, low thermal quenching of only 4% at operating temperatures, reasonable thermal and chemical stability as well as the above mentioned favourable emission properties, mark it as a highly promising compound which will, once thoroughly optimized, make for a formidable red phosphor in future white pc-LEDs. A prototype mid-power white LED using the SALON phosphor as its red component already demonstrated a significant increase in LER, while maintaining an excellent quality of light.
