<p>Molecular mixtures, where the single components do not, or only weakly, interact at moderate pressures, can form stable crystals when forced into a tight geometry. In the waterâ€“methane system we observe some striking pressure-induced phenomena: On the one hand, water recovers its stable low-pressure hexagonal I
 <italic>h</italic> phase, promoted by the pressure-induced ordering of the guest methane molecules and by their strong repulsive interaction, which prevails over the formation of hydrogen bonds between the 2 species. On the other hand, the ice lattice could preserve the methane from dissociation, which has been observed in some (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) but not all (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) Raman experiments on pressurized methane at ambient temperature and suggested by ab initio calculations (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We point out that the ice I
 <italic>h</italic> frame matches quite well the tetrahedral symmetry and the size of the methane molecule, so that the local tetrahedral topology with the 2:1 stoichiometry simply outperforms other possible arrangements in terms of space filling. Despite the repulsive interaction, the specific volume of this methane hydrate phase remains indeed close to the sum of those of ice and methane elemental phases in the explored pressure range, which encompasses the expected pressures on the outer planets of the Solar System.
