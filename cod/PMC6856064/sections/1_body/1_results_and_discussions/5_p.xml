 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>12</sub> represents Munsell code 3PB 3/11, which corresponds to a blue color having an emission peak around 465 nm. To compensate for this, we fabricated a PKG comprising of blue LED - blue, yellow, and red phosphors. Note that the conventional blue phosphor emits light with a peak wavelength of around 490 nm. The EL spectrum and the CRI index points of 1B-BYR LED PKG are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e,f)</xref>. Again, in this design, we could not achieve all the CRI points above 95. However, it is worth noting that these two LED packages–1B-GR and 1B-BYR, exhibit much better CRI points than 1B-Y PKG. In 1B-GR and 1B-BYR LED PKGs, we tried different combinations of phosphors ratio; however, we could not enhance the CRI points ≥95 along with a luminous efficacy above 100 lm/W. Note that we could achieve CRI points &gt;95; however, the efficacy was lower than 100 lm/W because of the trade-off between CRI points and the efficacy of the PKG. Therefore, in this study, we have designed the PKG by keeping the luminous efficacy around 100 lm/W, and thus, some of the individual CRI points were &lt;95.
