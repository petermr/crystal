<p>This paper introduces an effective way to cope with the weak signals in hard X-ray angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (HARPES). Full-field momentum imaging (

 <sup>−1</sup> and a useful energy range of ∼8 eV width substantially enhance the phase-space volume recorded simultaneously, in comparison with conventional 2D recording. A special objective lens and retarding zoom optics have been developed, optimized for low aberrations at high energies and 
 <italic>k</italic>-fields of view an order of magnitude larger than recorded by the existing low-energy momentum microscopes. As a special feature this objective lens can be operated with zero extractor field, thus opening the path to samples with corrugated surfaces, small crystallites and 3D micro-/nano-structures and generally to free sample rotation in front of the lens. In conventional momentum microscopes with high extractor field the sample must be essentially planar. The microscope can be operated in real-space imaging mode (PEEM) for checking the surface quality, finding suitable regions of interest on inhomogeneous samples or for observing and positioning of the photon footprint on the surface.
