<p id="Par10">One alternative is to focus on interactions, rather than structure. This is generally the approach of direct modelling, whereby a given interaction model is used to drive (e.g.,) a Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulation, which in turn is assessed in terms of its ability to account for experimental observables

 </sup>. The clear advantage is that the output is the physics itself: namely, how individual components of a system interact so as to produce the various effects observed experimentally.
