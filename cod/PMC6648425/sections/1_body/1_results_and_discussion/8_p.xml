 </xref>, the oxygen ion site 1–2 represent the oxygen migration along the channel in the Pr–O layers (path 1). Sites 1–3 and 1–4 correspond to the migration from the Pr–O layer to the Co–O layer (paths 2 and 3, respectively). Sites 3–4, 3–5, and 4–6 are responsible for the oxygen migration in the Co–O layers (paths 4–6, respectively). The calculated energy barriers are summarized in

 </xref>. The oxygen diffusion path is found to be highly anisotropic and have a two-dimensional network, possibly moving in a zigzag manner. Oxygen atom migration along path 2 is energetically favorable, and the calculated energy barrier is 0.99 eV, which is close to the experimental values of 1.02 eV obtained using the isotope exchange depth profile method

 </sup> and 1.20 eV extracted using the Arrhenius plot based on the area specific resistance.

 </sup> The results lead us to conclude that when an oxygen atom comes into the oxide, it favors to move across the atomic layers along the (011) (and symmetrically identical) direction, which is perpendicular to the one-dimensional oxygen-vacancy channel. This explains a neutron diffraction study reporting the alternate movement of oxygen from the Pr–O to Co–O layers or vice versa in the tetragonal PrBaCo
