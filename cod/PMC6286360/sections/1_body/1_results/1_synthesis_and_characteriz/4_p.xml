<p id="Par10">Considering the unique photophysical phenomenon of TPE chromophore, we then investigated the fluorescent properties of 3D-TPE-COF. Before that, we studied the fluorescence spectrum of the model compound in solid state. As shown in Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>, the powder of the model compound exhibited yellow-green emission peaking at 534 nm upon excitation. However, the PLQY of the model compound is considerably low (6.6%), as the photo-induced electron transfer from TPE units to imine groups will quench the fluorescence

 </sup>. Interestingly, 3D-TPE-COF can emit yellow light with an emission maximum at 543 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), but with a much higher PLQY (20%). According to the crystal structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), we believe this enhancement can be ascribed to the aggregation of TPE units in the 3D framework. In addition, the rigid skeleton can restrict the relaxation of TPE units, which may also contribute this enhancement. Due to the fluorescent and porous nature of 3D-TPE-COF, we tested its chemosensing behavior by choosing the commercially available picric acid (PA) as explosive model (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>) in water. Obviously, the fluorescence of 3D-TPE-COF was quenched when PA was gradually added into the suspension, and the Stern–Volmer curve quenching constant (
