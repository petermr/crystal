 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> are plotted on virtual YZ slices, at different X positions, for both samples. For HR-EBSD, only rotation about the out-of-plane axis

 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, is considered for one YZ slice through the indent centre. Rotations about the other two axes are not considered as they may have been modified due to stress-relaxation during FIB-lift-out preparation. HR-EBSD and Laue diffraction, respectively, have the advantage of high spatial resolution and high angular resolution, and are compared with the CPFE predictions using the same colour and length-scales.
