<p id="Par22">To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the shape evolution patterns, we considered bcc Fe (001) nanoplates with different diameters (including 
 <italic>d</italic> = 12
 <italic>a</italic>, 40
 <italic>a</italic>, and 50
 <italic>a</italic>). Their potential energies and typical configurations during the heating process are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Note that the aforementioned nanoplate with 
 <italic>d</italic> = 32
 <italic>a</italic> is also shown for comparison. With relatively high potential energy, the smallest nanoplate experiences more stages compared with the others. As seen in snapshot of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, the nanoplate with the diameter of 12
 <italic>a</italic> maintains its flat surfaces (a) until the bending starts to occur at 52 K (b) and finally the saddle shape forms at 62 K (c). However, this saddle structure does not last in a broad temperature range, and the following inter-layer diffusion happens at 84 K, leading to a sharp decrease in the potential energy. The thickened nanoplate, exemplified in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>(d), keeps its feature until further concentration appears at about 200 K. As for the nanoplate with 
 <italic>d</italic> = 40
 <italic>a</italic>, the saddle shape is stably held at the temperatures ranging from 1 to 190 K before collapsing into a compact particle. In the case of the nanoplate with 
 <italic>d</italic> = 50
 <italic>a</italic>, the saddle shape remains until 134 K (indicated by the arrow at “g” point) and then distorts to irregular structure, as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f. As can be seen, at 190 K, where the nanoplate with 
 <italic>d</italic> = 40
 <italic>a</italic> just begins to collapse, the one with 
 <italic>d</italic> = 50
 <italic>a</italic> has already completed its shape transformation from saddle to irregular. These observations suggest that, as the diameter increases from 12
 <italic>a</italic> to 40
 <italic>a</italic>, the temperature range where the saddle shape could be stable gradually becomes wider; however, when the diameter keeps growing (to 50
 <italic>a</italic>, for example), the stability of the saddle shape decreases to a certain extent. That is, although larger diameter leads to better structural stability (lower potential energy at ground state), it is not the only determining factor to affect the stability, influence from other aspects (such as kinetic and entropy effects) also plays an important role, especially when the nanoplate is large enough.
