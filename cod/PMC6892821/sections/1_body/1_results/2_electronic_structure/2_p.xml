<p id="Par9">The electronic properties of these three materials and their relation with the Cs-K ratio can be further analysed by inspecting the band character. For this purpose, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> we report the most relevant atom-projected contributions to the bands of each material. While in all systems the valence bands are dominated by the partially filled Sb 4
 <italic>p</italic> shell (see also refs.

 </sup>), the conduction bands carry the signatures of each compound. An overview on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> reveals that the bottom of the conduction region is dominated by the 
 <italic>s</italic>-states of the Sb atoms and, to lesser extend, also of the Cs atoms. This is not surprising, considering the parabolic shape of the lowest unoccupied band in the vicinity of its minimum, which falls at the

 <italic>s</italic> shell form these bands. Also electrons from the half-filled Cs 6
 <italic>s</italic> shell contribute to the conduction bands. However, different from the Sb 
 <italic>s</italic> electrons, the bands with Cs 
 <italic>s</italic>-character appear more delocalised throughout the BZ. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> different colors are used to mark the contributions from inequivalent Cs atoms in Cs

 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) sites are displayed in red (orange). We notice that contributions from Cs 
 <italic>s</italic>-states from atoms in 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> positions appear mainly in the lowest unoccupied band. On the other hand, Cs 
 <italic>s</italic>-states from atoms in 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> sites contribute not only to the bottom of the conduction but also to higher unoccupied bands. In the other two compounds, Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb, only one inequivalent Cs atoms is present. In both cases the Cs 
 <italic>s</italic>-states contribute to the lowest-unoccupied band in the vicinity of

 <italic>s</italic>-states in these materials are provided also to higher-energy unoccupied bands, especially around the the high-symmetry points X (both), L (Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb), and W (CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb). It should also be noted that in these systems the contributions from K atoms enter into play in the conduction region

 </sup>. In the bottom panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> the bands with Cs 
 <italic>d</italic>-character are displayed. Also in this case we adopt different colors to identify the contributions from inequivalent Cs atoms (light green for those on 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> sites and dark green for those on 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> sites). We emphasise that the weights of each state, quantified by the size of the colored circles, are represented with the same scaling ratio for each atomic character and in each material. Hence, the relative comparison between the plots displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> is quantitative. Interestingly, in the materials containing potassium, the contribution of the Cs 
 <italic>d</italic>-states to the conduction bands is complementary to those of the Cs and Sb 
 <italic>s</italic>-states. The Sb 
 <italic>d</italic>-shell does not significantly contribute to the first few eV above the CBm, as discussed in ref.
