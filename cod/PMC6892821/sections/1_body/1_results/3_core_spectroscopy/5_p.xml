<p id="Par14">We conclude this section by benchmarking the spin-orbit splitting, which is clearly visible in the calculated values of core binding energies in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, as well as in the measured XPS spectra (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), against tabulated references. In this way, we can use spin-orbit splitting, which is known to be an atomic property, as a parameter to validate both computed and measured values. We summarize this comparison in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, where we contrast the results of spin-orbit splitting for three selected states (Cs 3
 <italic>d</italic>, K 2
 <italic>p</italic>, and Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic>) in Cs-K-Sb materials (Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb calculated compounds) with those reported in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup> for the corresponding elemental crystals. The comparison with DFT values reveals a very good agreement for K 2
 <italic>p</italic> and Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic>, with discrepancies of less than 5%. The computed spin-orbit splitting for Cs 3
 <italic>d</italic> is instead overestimated by DFT by slightly more than 10%. Analogous trends are obtained also for the experimental values, where the discrepancy between Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb can be attributed to the uncertainty of the measurement. In this case, the splittings of K 2
 <italic>p</italic> and Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic> are smaller than the reference. It should also be noticed that the experimental data reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> are obtained from samples P007 and P015, which are not perfectly stoichiometric (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Although spin-orbit splittings are not meaningful to identify different stoichiometries, the mutual agreement between DFT and XPS results, also with respect to the tabulated values, enforces the connection between 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> theory and survey experiments on the grown photocathodes, which are very specific to the application and operation in a photoinjector.
