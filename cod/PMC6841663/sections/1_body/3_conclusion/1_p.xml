<p id="Par20">We have developed a Machine Learning-aided Local Structure Analyzer (ML-LSA) to classify the structures of LCPs containing rigid ellipsoidal particles. The ML model for local structure analyses was determined from small, and thus computationally efficient, monodomain LCP trajectories. The ML model was found to distinguish between nematic- and smectic-like monodomain structures with high accuracy. Furthermore, using feature selection, a single or set of order parameter(s) with good classification performance was revealed. For monodomain LCP trajectories, ML-LSA can distinguish between two structures using only the coordinates of the 1â€“4 nearest particles, which contain very little information about local structures.</p>
