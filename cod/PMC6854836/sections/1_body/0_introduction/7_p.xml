<p>It then came as a surprise when in 2003 Salvador et al. reported a strictly ordered and stoichiometric phase SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, which they termed β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> (and subsequently, rhombohedral SiB
 <sub>3</sub> was named α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
 </sup> β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> was obtained from a metal (Ga) flux synthesis at comparatively low synthesis temperatures (850–1000 °C). The orthorhombic crystal structure of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>, consists of layers of interconnected B
 <sub>12</sub> icosahedra parallel to the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane, which are stacked, but not bonded, in the 
 <italic>b</italic> direction. Linear zigzag chains of Si
 <sub>4</sub> rhomboid rings are embedded between these layers. Each Si
 <sub>4</sub> ring connects to eight B
 <sub>12</sub> units and, as a consequence, each Si atom attains a peculiar fivefold coordination by three Si and two B atoms. All B atoms in an icosahedron attain an exo-bond, either to B atoms of neighboring icosahedra in the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane or to Si atoms of neighboring Si
 <sub>4</sub> rings. The bonding properties of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> have been qualitatively rationalized by assigning each (all-exo-bonded) B
 <sub>12</sub> unit a charge of −2 and, accordingly, each rhomboid ring Si
 <sub>4</sub> a charge of +2.

 </sup> According to this bonding model, β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> is electron-precise, which is in agreement with its semiconductor properties (i.e., a band gap of 2 eV).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
 </sup> Thus, the structural properties of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, and presumably also the physical and electronic ones, are radically different from α-SiB
