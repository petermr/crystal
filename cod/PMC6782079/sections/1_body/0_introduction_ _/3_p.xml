<p>The various components of this instrument starting from the moderator, choppers, guide and detectors were previously described by Huq 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2011
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> â–¸</xref>). In this paper, we will describe the design philosophy in detail and its impact on data collection strategy for different types of scientific experiments conducted at the instrument. Scientific examples are provided to elucidate the versatile science for which this instrument can be used. We will also describe the gains offered by the rebuild and propose some future upgrades that might be considered.
