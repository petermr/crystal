<p>The structural symmetry of birnessite was confirmed by the Rietveld method. The structural parameters have been summarized in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and comparisons between the experimental and theoretical patterns are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The refined parameters confirm the triclinic structure for Mn4 and the hexagonal structure for Mn8 (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For Mn8 material, the crystallographic density value was higher than Mn4 (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The change in the crystallographic density for Mn8 was related to the variation in the crystal symmetry from triclinic to hexagonal. The c-cell parameter increased because of the rearrangement of the atoms in the interlayer region and the densification that resulted from temperature increase.
