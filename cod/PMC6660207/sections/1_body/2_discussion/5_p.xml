<p>In conclusion, we report an ultrabroad tunability of ~320 meV in 2D perovskite (PEA)

This PL red-shift turnability is fully reversible and immediately responds to pressure changes, with a quantum yield almost staying constant. Using simple modeling, it can be concluded that the excitonic recombination via radiative channel is rather enhanced within 3.5 GPa, in contrary to previous high-pressure studies in 3D organolead halide perovskites. Synchrotron radiation XRD and first-principles calculation consistently confirm that the compression process of (PEA)

 <sub>4</sub> is highly anisotropic, which can be regarded as quasi-uniaxial deformation along the out-of-plane direction. This quasi-uniaxial compression primarily squeezes the organic ligands and thus avoids the distortion of Pb─I bonds. The prominent thickness reduction of the organic barrier layers releases the quantum confinement of [PbI

It is noticeable that the functional pressure range is relatively low and mechanically achievable without the need of DAC, which suggests the considerable potential of in situ optoelectronic applications of 2D materials or structures with pressure as a tuning knob.
