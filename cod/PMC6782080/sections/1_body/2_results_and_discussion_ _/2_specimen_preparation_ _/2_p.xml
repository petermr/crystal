<p>After synthesis with the flame-transport approach, ZnO nanospikes were found to grow out of the Zn spheres (see the scanning electron images in Fig. 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> ▸</xref>), forming an interconnected network of particle–spike structures. Their morphology, in particular their length, can be adjusted from the nano- to the micrometre range by controlling the temperature and heating time (Mishra 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb38"> ▸</xref>). The nanospikes show tapered and plate-like morphologies with dimensions of 2–10 µm in length and 
 <italic>ca</italic> 200 nm laterally. Individual nanospikes feature multiple tips, which indicate the coalescence of crystalline precipitates during growth.
