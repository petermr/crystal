<p>Reactive mixtures of hydrides have been proposed as a way to tailor the dehydrogenation temperature or improve rehydrogenation in borohydrides [
 <xref rid="B89-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In this approach, two (or recently more) hydrides (simple or complex) are mixed; and, under suitable dehydrogenation conditions, they react with each other. The dehydrogenation is modified, including the dehydrogenation pathway, temperature, kinetics, and reversibility. Notably, the dehydrogenation temperature of composites is sensitive to the way of mixing of materials and the history of the composite; i.e., time and conditions of mixing, purity of reagents, cycling, etc. In the past decade, the research on LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> has extended, intentionally or not, to the formation of reactive mixtures (composites). Relevant published work is compiled in the next sections.
