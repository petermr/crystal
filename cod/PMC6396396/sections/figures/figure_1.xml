 <caption>
  <p>Structural elements of mullite and site labels. Subsequent layers are shown with decreased opacity. Chains of AlO
   <sub>6</sub> octahedra (dark blue) are interlinked by diclusters consisting of two 
   <italic>T</italic> sites and triclusters consisting of two 
   <italic>T</italic> sites and a 
   <italic>T*</italic> site. Two triclusters always embrace the void of an oxygen vacancy like the one between the two labelled 
   <italic>T*</italic> sites. Octahedrally coordinated Al1 atoms are bonded to four O1 atoms and two O2 atoms. The bridging oxygens of diclusters and triclusters are labelled O3 and O4, respectively. Cations on the 
   <italic>T</italic> site are labelled Al2 or Si2, and on the 
   <italic>T*</italic> site Al3 or Si3. The unit-cell borders of the mullite average structure are marked by black lines.
