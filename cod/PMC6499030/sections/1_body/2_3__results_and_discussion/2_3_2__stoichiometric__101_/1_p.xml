<p>The (101) surface has two possible terminations, both resulting in stoichiometric, nonpolar surfaces. In this study we consider the low-energy termination (Sanches et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), where, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, one of each of the following atoms are exposed per periodic cell: O
 <sub>2
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>,O
 <sub>3
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>,Ti
 <sub>5
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> and Ti
 <sub>6
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> producing the characteristic saw-tooth (101) surface structure. The 2c, 3c, 5c, and 6c indexes represent the two, three, 5 and 6 fold–coordinated atoms, respectively. The surface was modeled with a 2D periodic slab that includes four TiO
 <sub>2</sub> trilayers with the in–plane periodicity given by a 1 × 3 supercell of the conventional surface cell.
