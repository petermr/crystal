 </sup>. The first devitrified phases are the 
 <italic>ε</italic>-Al
 <sub>60</sub>Sm
 <sub>11</sub>, fcc-Al and a small fraction of an unknown phase, as indicated by several minor XRD peaks marked by diamonds that cannot be indexed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>. With an isothermal hold at 464 K, the unknown phase grows as indicated in the enhanced peaks in XRD as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>. More peaks of the unknown phase are also observed to appear in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a–d)</xref> show the bright field transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM) image, high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref> is a zoom-in view of SAD pattern in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d)</xref>, which shows the diffraction patterns of the 
 <italic>ε</italic>-phase and the unknown 
 <italic>η</italic>-phase. Diffraction rings from nanocrystalline fcc-Al grains are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d)</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c,d)</xref> suggest the grain size of the 
 <italic>ε</italic>- and the 
 <italic>η</italic>-phases are much larger than fcc-Al particles. However, as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a,b)</xref> indicate, the grain boundaries between 
 <italic>ε</italic>/
 <italic>ε</italic>, 
 <italic>ε</italic>/
 <italic>η</italic>, and 
 <italic>η</italic>/
 <italic>η</italic> are not clearly observed, probably due to the high density of fcc-Al particles dispersed (see also Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).
