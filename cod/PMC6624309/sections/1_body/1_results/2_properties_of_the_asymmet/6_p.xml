<p id="Par12">The simulated scattering pressure fields in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a–d)</xref> have excellently confirmed the transmittance and reflectance results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>. The incident fields are not shown. As depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a–b)</xref>, there is a significant reflection phenomenon when the waves are vertically incident at 
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.475, but the right-incident waves are reflectionless. Conversely, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c–d)</xref> show that the left incidence has no reflection but the right reflected wave is obviously at 
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.555. Based on the property of EPs, it can be designed into a novel acoustic switch device using the unidirectional reflectionless behavior, which is also applied to other multifunctional devices in acoustic wave manipulations.
