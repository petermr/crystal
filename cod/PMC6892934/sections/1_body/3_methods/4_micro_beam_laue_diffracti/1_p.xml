<p id="Par36">X-ray micro-diffraction was carried out at beamline 34-ID-E, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Lab, USA. A polychromatic X-ray beam (7–30 keV) was focused by KB mirrors to a sub-micron probe spot (500 nm (vertical) × 400 nm (horizontal) full width at half maximum near Lorentzian shape). With the sample placed at the probe focus in 45° reflection geometry, diffraction patterns were recorded on an area detector (Perkin-Elmer, #XRD 1621, with pixel size 200 × 200 µm) placed ~511 mm above the sample.</p>
