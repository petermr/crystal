<p>Normally, for a ferroelectric, the opposite (i.e., antiparallel) 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>up</sub> and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>down</sub> polarization states can be transformed into one another by application of an inversion operation. The calculated energy barrier for such a transformation in 
 <italic>T
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is rather high [0.70 eV/formula unit (f.u.)] (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, top). This is because such a transformation is associated with a large in-plane lattice displacement. However, the 
 <italic>T
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> phase is a distorted form of the hexagonal structure with a threefold rotation symmetry (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, there are three equivalent distortion vectors (
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>43</italic>
 </xref>). The switching between opposite polarization states with different distortion vectors (i.e., 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>up</sub> of one distortion vector and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>down</sub> of another distortion vector) should have smaller in-plane atomic displacements on average, leading to a smaller energy barrier. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> (bottom), in this scenario, the energy barrier between opposite polarization states denoted as 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>up1</sub> and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>down2</sub> is reduced to 0.29 eV/f.u. This value is smaller than (but comparable to) the energy barrier of ~0.43 eV/f.u. for BiFeO
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>44</italic>
 </xref>), a prototypical ferroelectric with a high Curie temperature (~1000 K). A transition path for polarization switching in WTe
 <sub>2</sub> with an even lower energy barrier has also been proposed recently (
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>45</italic>
 </xref>). Hence, polarization switching in WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is achievable under normal experimental conditions from a theoretical point of view, supporting the theory that WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is not only polar but also ferroelectric.
