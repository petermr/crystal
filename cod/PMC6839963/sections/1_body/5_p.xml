<p id="P7">For the 
 <bold>CRS</bold> and 
 <bold>COS</bold> groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), the energy distributions of the optimized structures still have a narrow energy spread (Δ
 <italic>E</italic> ≤ 16 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, these narrow ranges are visibly larger than those in the isolated Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> and YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecules, which illustrates the effect of intermolecular interactions on the orientation of the M
 <sub>3</sub>N cluster. The most stable structures in all cases are consistent with experimental observations. For example, in the 
 <bold>CRS-1</bold> and 
 <bold>COS-1</bold> systems, the Y atom is placed remotely to the Ni-site. However, the energy differences of energetically close conformers are minuscule. Therefore, in the window of 1
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>B</sub>
 <italic>T</italic> at room temperature (2.5 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>), one would find up to 10 conformers (as in the case of 
 <bold>CRS-0</bold>). Nevertheless, structurally, these minima are very similar to the global minimum.
