<p>Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 focus diffractometer at a scanning rate of 2°·min
 <sup>–1</sup> in the 2θ range from 10° to 90°, with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα
 <sub>1</sub> radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of the obtained materials were recorded by a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The persistent luminescence spectra and intensity decay curves were also measured using the same instrument after the samples were irradiated under 365 nm UV light for 2 min. The thermoluminescence curves were measured with a homemade spectrum instrument mainly consisting of a CCD detector and a heating apparatus. The sample was placed in a homemade sample holder and heated from room temperature to 413 K at a speed of 4 K·s
 <sup>–1</sup>. The sun irradiation experiments were carried out in a sunny day (11 a.m.), and the photographs were taken in a dark room.
