 <caption> Schematic view ( a) and simulated electron trajectories ( b, c) for the high-energy time-of-flight momentum microscope. Simulations for an initial kinetic energy of E kin = 4 keV with an extractor field of 1 kV mm −1 ( b) and E kin = 8 keV at extractor field zero ( c). The drift energy is 60 eV. Despite zero extractor field in ( c) the k-image diameters are quite similar, 18 Å −1 ( b) and 16 Å −1 ( c). Three lens groups focus and decelerate the beam; an adjustable field aperture in a real image plane can serve for selection of the region of interest. Despite the large k-fields the isochrones surfaces are almost planar; blue dots are time markers (10 ns spacing). The right-hand side shows measured results for a graphite single crystal: a typical ToF spectrum of the carbon 1 s core-level signal ( a) and two Kikuchi-type photoelectron diffraction patterns taken near normal emission ( b, detail of a larger pattern) and 30° off-normal ( c). </caption>
