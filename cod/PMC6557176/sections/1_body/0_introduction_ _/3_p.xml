 <italic>xy</italic> for the sample at the goniometer centre, and 
 <italic>z</italic> for its height) as only this ensures that the centre of rotation is in the sample surface over the course of the experiments. Then the incident angle is set, typically in the range of the critical angle α
 <sub>c</sub> (the angle below which total external reflection occurs) up to few degrees. Higher incident angles allow for a reduction in the beam footprint on the sample surface, which is crucial in terms of in-plane smearing and

 <italic>q</italic> = (4π/λ)sinθ, where θ is half the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation].
