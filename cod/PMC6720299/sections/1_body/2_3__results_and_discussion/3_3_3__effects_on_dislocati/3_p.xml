<p>According to the creep curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the dislocation density continuously increased during the creep process, indicating that the models enter primary creep and steady-state creep stages, but not the tertiary creep stage. During these stages, dislocation nucleation plays a crucial role in the deformation process of creep. When the creep curves show a tertiary creep, the dislocation density of the model may reduce to zero, and the shorter the steady-state creep stage, the faster the dislocation density decline. This can be explained by the diffusion of atoms at the grain boundaries during the tertiary creep stage, which triggers the model to lose crystallinity, hinders the dislocation movement and eventually eliminates the dislocation. The reduction and disappearance of dislocations also indicate that the creep mechanism may have been altered.
