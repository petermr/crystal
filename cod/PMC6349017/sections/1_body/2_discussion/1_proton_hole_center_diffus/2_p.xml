 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref> illustrates what we call the “proton hole center diffusion networks” at the ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surfaces in contact with liquid water, by graphing all possible pathways that the PHC at any given position can take, for both proton transfer reactions (colored lines) and vehicular movement (black dotted lines). The thicknesses of the colored lines qualitatively indicate the rate of the individual PT processes, with thicker lines indicating greater rates. For lines with gradients, transferring the PHC from the dark end to the light end is associated with a larger barrier than the reverse reaction, as also explained in the dashed rectangles in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>. There is no PHC diffusion into the bulk liquid water, other than the transient species formed during solvent-assisted PT (which is not explicitly indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).
