 <caption> ( a) Schematic diagram of the design of the lens. A hyperboloidal phase profile along the y direction is used to focus the acoustic plane wave to a single point at a distance f from the metamaterials. ( b) Discrete phase shifts along the y direction. ( c) Normalized absolute pressure field for the designed lens with f = 5λ. ( d) Distribution of the absolute pressure in the y direction at x = −0.13  m. </caption>
