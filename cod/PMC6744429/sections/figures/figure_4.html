 <caption> Efficient SH HG beam generation. a The 3D NPC model and the confocal SH image of its cross-section in the x– z plane (the length of scale bar, 10 μm). b The SH diffraction pattern pumped under the QPM wavelength of 818 nm. c Dependence of output power of the 1 st diffraction order on the fundamental wavelength at a pump power of 0.4 W. d Dependence of output power of the SH HG beam on pump power at the wavelength of 818 nm. The maximal conversion efficiency reaches to ~3.9 × 10 −4 for the 1st diffraction order </caption>
