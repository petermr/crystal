<p>It can be observed that the photochromic behavior drastically depends on the starting sample. The yellow sample exhibits a very low photochromic behavior, i.e., the diffuse reflectance spectrum obtained after 90 min. irradiation being superimposable to the starting one. Hence, the monoclinic phase, with 50 nm crystallites, exhibits poor photochromism. This could be explained by a very rapid recombination of the exciton pairs (electron created in conduction band and holes created in valence band when the compound is UV irradiated). H
 <sub>2</sub>O has been proposed to be at the origin of the photochromism observed on WO
 <sub>3</sub> thanks to a redox reaction between water and electron holes leading to tungsten ion photo-reduction [

 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-01555" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our condition this phenomenon is unlikely to occur and can be considered negligible. One can notice that the black sample does not exhibit photochromic behavior. For this second sample, the lack of measureable photochromism is more likely due to the occurrence of a very dark starting coloration assigned to a big amount of absorbing W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions already present in the material than due to the absence of the redox process involving tungsten ions. Finally, on the opposite of the two previous samples, the blue sample exhibits large photochromism as compared with previous investigation reported on WO

The DC optical contrast in the L*a*b* system between the sample non-irradiated and the sample irradiated for 90 min is about 25, which is more than four times the optical contrast that can be easily detected by human eye sensitivity. A kinetic study was then conducted on this product and the results are presented in
