<p id="Par12">The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is also an important parameter to consider when evaluating the electrocatalytic activity of a material and can provide a very good indicator of substantial changes at the electrode interface

 </sup>. The proportional relationship between the double layer capacitance (C
