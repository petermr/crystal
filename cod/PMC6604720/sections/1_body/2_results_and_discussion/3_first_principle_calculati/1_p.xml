<p>Our calculations reveal that the ground state structure of Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> has a hexagonal crystal symmetry with space group P63/m. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> demonstrates the 14-atom primitive unit cell of Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> which consists of 2 yttrium, 6 oxygen and 6 hydrogen atoms. The optimized lattice parameters of bulk Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> are found to be 
 <italic>a</italic> = 6.10 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 6.10 Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.51 Å. In this structure each Y atom bonds with nine O atoms with a bond length of 2.39 Å. According to the Pauling scale electronegativity of Y, H and O are 1.22, 2.20 and 3.44, respectively. Bader charge analysis shows that the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> crystal structure is formed by 0.73 (0.60) 
 <italic>e</italic> charge transfer from the Y (H) to the O atom.
