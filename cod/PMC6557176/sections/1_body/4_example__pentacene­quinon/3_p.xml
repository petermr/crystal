<p>Prior to deposition of the molecule, the substrate surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ar
 <sup>+</sup> sputtering with an energy of 600 eV and thermal annealing at 773 K. The mol­ecular film was then deposited from an effusion cell at a constant temperature of 463 K under ultra-high-vacuum conditions (base pressure 10
 <sup>−10</sup> mbar = 10
 <sup>−8</sup> Pa) directly onto the substrate held at room temperature. The film thickness was monitored 
 <italic>in situ</italic> using optical differential reflectance spectroscopy (Forker &amp; Fritz, 2009
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> ▸</xref>) and was calculated to be ten (not necessarily full and densely packed) layers.
