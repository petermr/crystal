<p id="Par27">As for MgO, to induce potential vacancy dissociation, MD simulations at 1000 K are applied to the system for 60 ps followed by additional MD simulations at 300 K for 1 ps to allow  the system to escape any metastable configuration. After that, the system is quenched to 0 K and energy minimized. After the thermal anneal, all six configurations exhibit vacancy dissociation. Compared to site 4 (before the jog formation), the energy levels after the jog formation at different sites are substantially lower, ranging from −0.32 to −0.61 eV. The possible reason for the energy range can be due to the site-specific configurational influence to the jog geometries. The atomistic results here suggest that the mechanism of vacancy dissociation through jog formation is not limited to rocksalt-structured materials, and can be extended to more complicated lattices such as UO
 <sub>2</sub>. In fact, the mechanism is more likely in a material such as UO
 <sub>2</sub>. In this case, the jog formation events are driven by a reduction in energy in addition to the entropic contribution. In Fig.
