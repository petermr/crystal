<p>In silicates, silicon is usually in tetrahedral sites (as in quartz, olivine, or wadsleyite, for instance), but with increasing pressure it can occupy octahedral sites (as in high‐pressure phases like stishovite or bridgmanite). To confirm the silicon coordination predicted by the structure refinement, we have characterized its oxygen environments. We have performed EELS analyses and more specifically energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) characterizations. Three ELNES spectra can be used to distinguish between tetrahedral and octahedral sites for silicon: the Si K‐edge, Si L2.3‐edge, and O K‐edge. We have focused our attention on the O K‐edge ELNES spectra. Actually, this edge has low core loss energy (near 530 eV) and offers noticeable changes in ELNES signatures from SiO
 <sub>4</sub> to SiO
 <sub>6</sub> (Sharp et al.,
