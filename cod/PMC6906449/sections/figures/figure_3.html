 <caption> Thermoelectric performance of Ag 1- x InTe 2 without heat treatment as a function of temperature for different x values. ( a) Seebeck coeffcients ( α) with different x values; ( b) Electrical conductivities ( σ) with different x values; ( c) Lattice thermal conductivities ( κ L) with different x values, an inset is the total thermal conductivities ( κ); ( d) ZT values as a function of temperature. Besides that, the TE performance of the sample at x = 0.15 after heat treatment at 813 K for 72 h was presented for comparison. </caption>
