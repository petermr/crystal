<p>According to the theoretical calculation and experimental study [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], both Fe-based and Ni-based Heusler compounds may undergo a tetragonal distortion and transform from cubic phase into tetragonal phase. This phase transformation is still related with the crystal structure arrangement and, thus, we further investigate the tetragonal distortion in terms of 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio variation in both L2
 <sub>1</sub> and XA structures under ferromagnetic state. Note, when the 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio is varied, the unit cell volume is fixed at the equilibrium condition. The corresponding structures for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub>-type and tetragonal XA-type are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F1">figure 1</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>,
 <italic>d</italic>, respectively. In order to understand the phase stability, we first calculate the total energy at different 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratios, and the results are presented in figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F6">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F7">7</xref> for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, respectively.
