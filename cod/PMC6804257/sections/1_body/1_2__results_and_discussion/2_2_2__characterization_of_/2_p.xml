<p>The thermogram of CuL14 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figure S5</xref>) shows the stepwise release of two water molecules at 71 and 114 °C, and the weight loss at 168 °C is ascribable to a water molecule coordinated to the central metal. The release of a couple of acetate pendant groups from the EDTA moiety finished at 255 °C. The weight-loss pattern described by MnL14 indicates the presence of a water molecule included in the coordination sphere and liberated at 197 °C (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figure S6</xref>). The Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complex, FeL14, involved three water molecules: two of them involved in the crystal lattice were released at 117 °C, and the third in the coordination sphere at 182 °C (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figure S7</xref>). Additional weight loss at 245 °C was due to counter ion NO
 <sub>3</sub>, and carboxylic pendant groups were eliminated at 405 °C.
