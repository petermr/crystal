<p>PVO is a C-type antiferromagnet (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>) due to the presence of a 
 <italic>d</italic> electron with 
 <italic>S</italic> = 1/2. In oxides, it can either occur in the middle of an octahedron cage (CaVO
 <sub>3</sub>, SrVO
 <sub>3</sub>)

 </sup> or it can form a strong vanadyl bond with one O with a short bond length (ca. 1.55–1.60 Å).

 </sup> PVO is reported to exhibit a tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition under pressure, but no structural transition was observed from 0 K to its decomposition temperature.

 </sup> Moreover, the minimum (apical) V–O bond length in the VO
 <sub>5</sub> pyramid in tetragonal PVO is 1.68 Å. This relatively longer bond shows a comparatively weaker vanadyl bond than usual. The average of the four planar V–O bond lengths is 1.99 Å. In agreement with these findings, the calculated Goldschmidt tolerance factor for PVO also shows a value of 1.036, which usually indicates noncentrosymmetric distortion.
