 </sup> Therefore, although the twin defects themselves can in a way be considered as the shortest possible wurtzite (WZ) inclusion, these NWs are made exclusively of ZB GaP. Yet, the periodic twin arrangement confers a hexagonal symmetry to the NW as a whole. As we will discuss below, this unusual crystal lattice is an excellent test-bed for monitoring how the existence of an overall periodicity affects the phononic properties of the material in terms of number, frequency, and symmetry of the phonon modes arising from the superstructure. Indeed, we show that we can rationally design the phononic properties by tuning the superlattice period. Moreover, we find that the TSL phonons are keeping their coherence over tens of nanometers at room temperature, which is a clear indication that the defect-free and atomically sharp interfaces of TSL NWs make them the ideal superstructure to study coherent phonons and wave interference.
