<p>In summary, with the combination of XPS spectroscopy, HR-TEM, Raman spectroscopy, ADRDM and angle-resolved electrical measurements, we successfully revealed the in-plane optical and electrical anisotropy of 2D layered 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, we presented the highly anisotropic photoelectric property in detail, showing a 300-fold improvement in the photosensitivity. Moreover, due to its attractive properties, mono- or few-layer 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> was shown to be a promising, novel and fascinating material for high-performance magnetoresistance applications in thin-film electromagnetics [

 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, its highly anisotropic properties hold promise for a new direction in the development of angle-resolved optoelectronic and electronic devices. For instance, 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is a natural material for designing polarizers and polarization sensors in the broadband spectral range because of its semi-metal bandgap structure and high anisotropy. In addition to angle-dependent photodetectors, its angle-resolved photoelectric properties may permit the development of plasmonic devices in which the surface plasmon polariton frequency has a highly directional dependence on the wave vector. Besides, the semi-metal bandgap structure allows various energy band engineering methods [
