<p id="Par22">From the above results, it can be seen that the CIE color coordinates (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) can be brought close to the white region using 150-μm-thick QD films. Therefore, the thickness of QD films was fixed, and the effects of brightness uniformity of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs were discussed. Using the 5-point brightness uniformity measurement method, the brightness uniformity of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLU + 150-μm-thick QD films were estimated to be 35%, 39%, and 86%, respectively. Obviously, there were 1.47 times and 1.19 times improvement in the BLU brightness uniformity of 180° mini-CSPLED BLU compared with that of the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU and 150° mini-CSPLED BLU. Therefore, it was found that the use of 180° mini-CSPLED BLU +150-μm-thick QD film could effectively improve the overall BLU brightness uniformity. The brightness uniformity calculation of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs + 150-μm-thick QD films was summarized in Table
