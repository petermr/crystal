 </sup> In order to be able to design optimal VAN structures, the current knowledge gap on the fundamental understanding of the growth mechanisms during composite nanostructure formation must be filled. Detailed simulation of the VAN growth mechanism would provide important insight into the compositional, structural, and processing factors that influence the achievable VAN structures. Solid-on-solid kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (KMCS) models of vertical nanocomposite growth have previously been developed to study the influence of temperature,
