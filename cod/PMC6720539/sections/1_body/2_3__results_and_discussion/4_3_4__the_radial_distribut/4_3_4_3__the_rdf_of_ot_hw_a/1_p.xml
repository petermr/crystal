<p>The RDF of O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub> and O
 <sub>t</sub>-O
 <sub>w</sub> of montmorillonites with different charge density are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f008">Figure 8</xref>. It can be seen that the maximum peak value of g (O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) is approximately 2.5 Å, and the maximum peak value of g (O
 <sub>t</sub>-O
 <sub>w</sub>) is approximately 3.4 Å, which indicates that H
 <sub>w</sub> is closer to the siloxane surface than O
 <sub>w</sub> in water molecular. The reason is that the water molecules are polar molecules, the side of H
 <sub>w</sub> is positively charged, and the side of O
 <sub>w</sub> is negatively charged. On the other hand, the siloxane surface of montmorillonite is negatively charged, and due to the effect of the polar force, the H
 <sub>w</sub> is close to the siloxane surface and forms hydrogen bonds with the O
 <sub>t</sub>. As a result, H
 <sub>w</sub> is closer to the siloxane surface than O
 <sub>w.</sub> In addition, from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f008">Figure 8</xref>, we can also find that the effect of layer charge density of montmorillonite on the distribution of H
 <sub>w</sub> and O
 <sub>w</sub> in the layer is obvious. With the increases of charge density, the peaks of O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub> and O
 <sub>t</sub>-O
 <sub>w</sub> get higher and steeper, which clearly indicates that the arrangement of H
 <sub>w</sub>, O
 <sub>w</sub>, and O
 <sub>t</sub> is tight, and the arrangement of water molecules in the montmorillonite inter-layer is more compact.
