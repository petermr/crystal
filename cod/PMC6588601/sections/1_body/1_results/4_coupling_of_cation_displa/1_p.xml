<p id="Par21">Concerted cation displacements in the PNRs are expected to be accompanied by characteristic distortions of oxygen octahedra. We analyzed local distortions of the octahedral framework by expanding oxygen displacements for the individual octahedra into a set of deformation modes, and then searched for correlations among these modes and the cation displacements. A full orthonormal basis of the 18 deformation modes for an octahedron (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>) was defined to reflect common lattice distortions (three tetragonal, three orthorhombic, and three octahedral rotations), with the remaining modes (three translational, six bending, F
 <sub>1u</sub>- and F
 <sub>2u</sub>) selected to provide a complete set. In this basis, a symmetric octahedron’s breathing mode (A
 <sub>1g</sub>) is the sum of the three tetragonal modes, whereas the rhombohedral deformations can be calculated from the combinations of the orthorhombic and tetragonal modes. The amplitudes of the 18 basis modes were determined for every octahedron in the configuration.
