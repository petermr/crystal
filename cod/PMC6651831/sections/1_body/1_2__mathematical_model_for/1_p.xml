<p>In this section, analytical equations are derived for the effective properties of a transverse thermoelectric composite. In the mathematical model, unit cell structure is used to reduce the complexity of this problem. This unit cell model has been proven to be a convenient tool in studies on the effective properties of a material with periodical structures [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>, where a fiber (F) with a square cross-section was placed at the corner of a cubic matrix (M). The square fiber was used in the unit cell model for mathematical simplicity. The contact between the matrix and fibrous material was assumed to be ideal so that electrical and thermal contact resistance were not considered.
