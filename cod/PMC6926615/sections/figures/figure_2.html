 <caption> Synthesis of lead-free perovskites. ( a) SEM images of Cs 2SnI 6; ( b) calculated phase diagram of Cs–Sn–I. Reproduced with permission [ 31]. Copyright WILEY-VCH Verlag, GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany, 2019. ( c) Visualized dual emission between the hydrated and dehydrated species, fabricated by embedding the perovskite material, Cs 2InBr 5⋅H 2O into an etched butterfly pattern.

( d) Schematic representation on the phase formation of Cs 2AgInCl 6:Bi NCs at different synthesis temperatures (180–280 °C) in three steps: (I) Complexing of optimized precursors including OA, OlAm, and HCl; (II) AgNO 3 and InCl 3 reacting with OA to form Ag−oleate and In−oleate and oleylammonium chlorine. Ag 0 NPs are formed by the reduction of Ag+ in the presence of amine ligands; (III) formation of Cs 2AgInCl 6 NCs at different synthesis temperatures followed by the injection of CsOA; ( e) UV−Vis absorption (dashed line), photoluminescence (PL) (excitation at 368 nm), and PL excitation (emission at 580 nm) spectra of Bi-doped Cs 2AgInCl 6 NCs dispersion in hexane obtained at different synthesis temperatures (180–280 °C); the insets show the samples irradiated under a 365 nm UV lamp.

( g) Photograph of as-synthesized CsSn 0.5Ge 0.5I 3 perovskite solid using the melt-crystallization method. ( h) Schematic illustration of the single-source evaporation method for the deposition of ultrasmooth CsSn 0.5Ge 0.5I 3 perovskite thin film.
