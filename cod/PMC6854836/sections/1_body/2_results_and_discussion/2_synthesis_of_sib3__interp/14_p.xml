<p>Salvador et al. showed that the kinetic barriers associated with β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> formation can be overcome by the application of a molten metal flux.

 </sup> Alternatively, the application of high pressures should minimize barriers associated with diffusion and thus allow the synthesis of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> at much shorter times and lower temperatures. This was then confirmed in experiments where Si/B reaction mixtures were compressed to 5.5–8 GPa and subsequently heated. α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> formed quantitatively after 6 h at the lowest dwelling temperature applied, 900 °C. Quantitative β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> formation, presumably through α-to-β conversion, was obtained at 1100 °C within 12 h. At 1300 °C, the product constituted a mixture of SiB
 <sub>6</sub> and Si.
