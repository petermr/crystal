<p id="p0070">The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were performed on a Vertex 70 (Bruker) spectrometer. The powdered samples were mixed with KBr in a weight ratio of 1:100 and pressed into 1 mm thick tablets. The IR spectra were recorded in transmission mode with a 2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> resolution in the 350‒4000 cm-1 spectral range. The measured spectra (%T) were background-corrected and transformed into adsorbance values by using the instrument's software (Opus). The Diffuse Reflectance Ultra-Violet-Visible (DR-UV-Vis) spectra were obtained on a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using an integrating sphere accessory. The spectra were acquired with a 2 nm step in the two-beam geometry from a layer of the powdered samples against BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> as a reference. The measured spectra (in %R) were converted into the Kubelka-Munk function (
 <italic>F</italic>) values by using the instrument's software (UVProbe). The band gap (E
 <sub>g</sub>) value was evaluated graphically for the indirect semiconductor from TAUC plot in the coordinates (
