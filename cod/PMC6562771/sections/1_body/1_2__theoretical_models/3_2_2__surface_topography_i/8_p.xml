<p>Generally, the vibration between the diamond tool and workpiece surface is one the kinematic errors in the diamond turning process. In the recent studies, researchers tend to integrate other motion errors into the surface topography model. For instance, Kong et al. analyzed the spindle axial motion error, slide motion error and stroke error on the surface generation in fast servo machining [
