<p>Reactions between Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> salts and H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 receptor gave the complexes [CuL14]
 <sup>0</sup>, [MnL14]
 <sup>0</sup>, and [FeL14]
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively, designated henceforth as CuL14, MnL14, and FeL14. The complexes were characterized by ESI-MS, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrational spectroscopy. The thermal behaviors of CuL14, MnL14, and FeL14 were studied by TGA to determine the presence of coordinated water molecules. The thermograms are shown in
