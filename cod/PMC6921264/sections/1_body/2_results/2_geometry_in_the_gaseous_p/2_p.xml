 </xref> compares the structural parameters optimized at the PBE0/aug-cc-pVDZ and fitted FF levels. Because of the planar structure, dihedral and improper angles are not included. Obviously, the parameters from the FF are in good agreement with those from DFT. The mean error (ME) of bond lengths is about 0.006 Å, and the ME of bond angles is about 0.1°. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of bond lengths and angels are 0.015 Å and 1.0°. The maximum error (MAXE) about bond lengths existing in the bond between C1 and N12 is about 0.20 Å. Among bond angles, the MAXE is about 1.9° in the angle C2–N3–C4.
