 <caption> Crystal structure of bulk BiI 3 (left) compared to the experimentally elucidated structure model of BiI 3 film on Bi 2Se 3(0001) (right). The film consists of a complete first TL adjacent to the Bi 2Se 3 (0001) surface and a second TL, which is only half filled. Iodine atoms are depicted in red, the bismuth atoms are color-coded in accordance with their shifts from the central position within the octahedra (traced by a dotted line). Atoms are numbered according to Table  1. Interplanar distances and shifts of the bismuth atoms are given in Å. We estimate the uncertainty of the distance determination equal to 0.1 Å. </caption>
