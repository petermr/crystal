<p>Although the FF tends to give a smaller lattice volume, we test the FF estimation on pressure response of the crystal structure under pressure in the range from 0 to 20 GPa. Additionally a series of 
 <italic>NPT</italic> simulations were performed to obtain the equilibrium crystal structure at the different pressures. Using the lattice parameters, the density and relative density of LLM-105 under various pressures are derived as shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02410/suppl_file/ao9b02410_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4</ext-link>. The density increases rapidly under low pressures (&lt;3 GPa) and increases slowly but in a nearly linear way under high pressures. The predicted density and relative density are more or less greater than the measured ones but the discrepancies are less than 0.2 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup> or 3.4%. The pressure-dependent relative cell volumes and lattice parameters are shown in

 </sup> Similar with the experiment, the

 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> axes when pressure is applied. The EOS is critical in describing the properties of materials. Thus, we conducted unweighted fits of the pressure–volume data using a third-order Birch–Murnaghan (B–M) EOS as follow
