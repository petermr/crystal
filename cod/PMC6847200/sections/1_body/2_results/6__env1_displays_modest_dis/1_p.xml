<p>In the cellular context, 2′-dG riboswitches are challenged by chemically similar compounds to their cognate ligand, the most similar being riboguanosine (rG). In rapidly growing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, the intracellular concentration of rG is 1.6 μM as compared to a 2′-dG concentration of 0.57 μM (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Measurement of the affinity of 
 <italic>env1</italic> for rG revealed that the aptamer binds this metabolite with only a 2.6-fold lower affinity than 2′-dG (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This contrasts with 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA, which binds 2′-dG with ∼30-fold (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to 50-fold (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) higher affinity than rG. To determine whether other class-II riboswitches exhibit reduced selectivity for 2′-dG over rG, we examined three other 2′-dG-II riboswitches with varying sequences within the three-way junction (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Overall, class II 2′-dG riboswitches vary broadly in their ability to discriminate between 2′-dG and rG, with 
 <italic>env1</italic> being the least selective while the 
 <italic>env23</italic> sequence has a far greater selectivity for 2′-dG than 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA. This range in selectivity is accompanied by a broad range in affinities, varying almost 2 orders of magnitude in 2′-dG binding affinity and approaching 3 orders of magnitude in rG binding affinity. This broad spectrum of binding affinities for the cognate ligand is similar to that observed in other riboswitches, such as the SAM-I riboswitch (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).
