 <caption> Surface profiles of the nano-indents; ( a) and ( b) as obtained through CPFE formulation for the unimplanted and the helium-implanted tungsten sample respectively, ( c) and ( d) as obtained through AFM measurements for the unimplanted and helium-implanted tungsten sample respectively. ( e) and ( f) show line profiles of surface height extracted along &lt;110&gt; and &lt;100&gt; directions respectively for the unimplanted and implanted material. Also shown are the surface profiles predicted by CPFE. </caption>
