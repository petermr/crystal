<p>In the previous literatures, natural frequencies and mode shapes are usually obtained by finite elements analysis (FEA) with the simulating software [

 <xref rid="B14-micromachines-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, for a complex structure, it will take a long time to do the simulation and the meshing density has a great influence on the accuracy of simulating results. Meanwhile, with the FEA method, only the numerical solution can be obtained which cannot reflect the inner relationship between the results and the parameters. Therefore the development of a novel method for mathematical modeling of the frequencies and the associate mode shapes of a vibratory gyroscope is in urgent.
