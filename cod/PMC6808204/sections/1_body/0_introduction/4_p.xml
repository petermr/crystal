<p>In this work, we report the synthesis of nitrogen-doped CDots (N-CDots). The doping with nitrogen enables us to tune the resulting emission color of the CDots from blue to green. In order to obtain color conversion layers with these N-CDots, a mixture of water-based polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and N-CDots were prepared and subsequently processed into thin films and fibers. Throughout this study, the term “water-based” is used to emphasize that during the fabrication of the color conversion layers, the CDots and the PVP were taken from their dispersion or solution in (mainly) distilled water without introducing any toxic or organic solvents. The conversion layers were prepared in the form of drop-cast composite films with varying amounts of CDots in order to investigate the effect on the resulting white-light properties. Moreover, commercial inorganic red phosphors were integrated into the PVP/N-CDot composite films to explore the impact of the red emission component on the white-light properties. Additionally, composite fibers were prepared by electrospinning of the water-based PVP/N-CDots. By adjusting the amount of fibers in the color conversion layers, the quality of the generated white light was improved, and a high CRI together with a low CCT were achieved.</p>
