<p>In the second stage, the delivery robot rotated through 90°, and the theoretical heading angle after turning was −90°. Then, the robot moved in a straight direction again, reached the second turning point, and rotated through 90°. At this time, the theoretical heading angle should be 180°. The measurement data of the IMU has errors, and the theoretical range of its measurement values is (−180°, 180°]. Hence, measurement data similar to the step signal will be generated at a specific time. The delivery robot will then return to the starting point via the remaining turning points and the straight path.
