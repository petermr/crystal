<p>Previous theoretical and experimental studies on the high-pressure behaviors of GeSe polymorphs have led to controversies regarding the detailed phase transition mechanism. The variations of the structural parameters, elastic constants, and phonon properties during the phase transition also lack investigation in the literature. In our work, we performed systematic first principle calculations on the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> to 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> transformation of GeSe polymorphs within the application of hydrostatic pressure from 0 to 50 GPa to reveal the origin of the phase transition mechanism.
