<p>It is important to emphasize the potential impact of the current work on both the development of analytical methodology and future explorations in the field of subnanoscience. The subnanosensitive Raman spectroscopic method demonstrated in this study allows the direct detection of the spectral features of subnanoscale materials even at extremely low surface loadings. Direct detections of these small substances induce a breakthrough of further precise technological developments at the atomic level in analytical chemistry. In addition, a combined study with direct spectral observations and theoretical simulations allows the first ever rational assignment of the broad peaks in the spectra of these materials and, furthermore, reveals direct evidences to indicate the role of surface hydroxyl groups to express unique catalytic activity of Sn oxide SNCs. Detailed understanding of physical and chemical nature of substances facilitates the rational design of subnanomaterials on the atomic scale for practical applications. As a consequence, the development of subnanosensitive vibration spectroscopy will accelerate material innovation and development studies of subnanomaterials, promoting subnanoscience as an interdisciplinary research field.</p>
