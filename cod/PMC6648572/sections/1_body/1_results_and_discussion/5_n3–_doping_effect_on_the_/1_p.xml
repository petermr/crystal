<p>To precisely examine the N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping effect, the structural strain induced by the N
 <sup>3–</sup>-doping was estimated because the ionic radius of N
 <sup>3–</sup> (1.46 Å at CN = 4) is larger than that of O
 <sup>2–</sup> ion (1.38 Å at CN = 4). The strain can be determined using the Williamson–Hall (W–H) method from XRD profile analysis.

 </sup> The total peak width at half-maximum intensity (β

 </sub>) is determined from the summation of the size broadening (β
 <sub>D</sub>) and the strain broadening (β
 <sub>s</sub>)

 </disp-formula>The size broadening is correlated with the Scherrer equation: β
 <sub>D</sub> = 
 <italic>k</italic>λ/(
 <italic>D</italic> cos θ), where 
 <italic>D</italic> is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, and 
 <italic>k</italic> is the shape factor. The strain broadening is expressed by ε = β
 <sub>s</sub>/4 tan θ, where ε is maximum strain (tensile or compressive). Thus, we get the W–H equation from

 </xref>): for Li
 <sub>2</sub>CaSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, from −0.012% (before N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, LCSO) to −0.026% (after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, LCSON); for Li
 <sub>2</sub>SrSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, from 0.0056% (before N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, LSSO) to −0.0095% (after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, LSSON); and for Li
 <sub>2</sub>BaSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, from −0.035% (before N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, LBSO) to −0.032% (after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, LBSON). The positive and negative values correspond to the tensile and compressive strains, respectively. As the temperature increases, generally, a crystal lattice undergoes tensile stress and expands. It is generally accepted that under the tensile stress, the lattice vibrations and/or the formation of defects force the phosphors more easily to promote nonradiative relaxation.

 </sup> Thus, it is presumed that the enhancement of PL intensity is ascribed to the compensation of the thermally induced tensile stress by the compressive stress due to the N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping in Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors. The fact that the PL intensities of the two phosphors (for Ca and Sr) remarkably enhanced after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, whereas that of Li
 <sub>2</sub>BaSiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is not changed, corroborates the structural strain effect on the PL intensity (see 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>). Furthermore, the structural strain effect by the N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping prominently appears in UV–visible absorbance spectra (see 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>). Evidently, for Ca and Sr, the stronger absorption bands between 300 and 500 nm are present after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping, while for Ba, the absorption bands are nearly same before and after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping. Presumedly, the compressive strain plays an important role in the effective transfer of the absorbed energy from the host lattice to the activator ion even though the difference of strain values before and after N
 <sup>3–</sup> doping is very small, resulting in the enhanced absorption band and PL intensity.
