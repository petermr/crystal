<p>The atomic force of each time step was updated according to the DFT calculations of the electronic structure using HASEM software. The generalized gradient approximation was used for the exchange-correlation functional in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof form. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials specialized for EM crystals were used to replace the core electrons. The valence electrons, described by linear combinations of numerical pseudoatomic orbitals, were calculated on a three-dimensional real-space grid. The reliability of the DFT calculations to describe the structures, energetics, dynamics, mechanical properties, detonation performance and sensitivity of EM crystals has been extensively confirmed in previous work [
