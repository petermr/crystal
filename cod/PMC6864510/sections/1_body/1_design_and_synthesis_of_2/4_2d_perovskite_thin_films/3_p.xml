 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref> The film thickness varies from 3 to 100 nm, affected by the precursor concentration and the spin‐coating speed. Atomically thin uniform 2D square perovskite (BA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbBr
 <sub>4</sub> was reported by Yang's group in 2015.[qv: 17c] A very dilute precursor solution was dropped onto a silica substrate and heated to dry under 75 °C. When a mixed solvent of DMF and chlorobenzene was used to dissolve BABr and PbBr
 <sub>2</sub>, the obtained products were thick and randomly distributed on the substrate. When acetonitrile was introduced to form a ternary mixed solvent, uniform square perovskite sheets grew on the substrate because of a faster evaporation (
