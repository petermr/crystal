<p>Sn oxide SNCs Sn
 <sub>12</sub>, Sn

 <sub>60</sub> were prepared by following the template methods developed in our group (

 </xref>). Briefly, Sn-dendrimer (DPA-TPM-G4) complex was prepared by the addition of 12, 28, and 60 equivalents of SnCl
 <sub>2</sub> acetonitrile solution (6.3 mM) into a 1 ml of 3 Î¼M DPA-TPM-G4 (

 </xref>) dichloromethane solution. The complexation process was monitored by the spectral variation based on the coordination of tin chloride with the imine nitrogen atoms in titration ultraviolet-visible spectra (fig. S3). In this procedure, the yellowish DPA-TPM-G4 solution turned into orange solution. The mixture was stirred for a few minutes before a 1 ml of 238 mM NaBH
 <sub>4</sub> methanol solution was added for the reduction of tin chloride to metallic tin within the dendritic molecular capsule, which was gradually oxidized to tin oxide by air.
