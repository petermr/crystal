<p>The nature and strength of the bonding can also be determined by crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis where the negative and positive COHP values indicate bonding and antibonding interactions, respectively. We have calculated the COHP among the constituents of PVO (Pb–O, Pb–O2, V–O1, V–O2, O1–O2) as shown in

 </xref>. It can be seen that all of the occupied states for Pb–O and V–O interactions have bonding states for both paraelectric and ferroelectric phases. The Pb–O2 interaction for both the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases are almost the same. But the interaction between Pb and O1 in the ferroelectric case has more bonding states, which are due to the hybridization between O 2p and Pb 6s/6p states. This indicates the presence of stronger covalency between Pb and O1 in the case of the ferroelectric phase compared to the paraelectric one, which is also consistent with our charge density and partial DOS analyses. In the ferroelectric phase, the V–O1 bonding interaction is stronger than V–O2 bonding interaction, which is due to the off-center displacement of V atom toward the O1 atom.
