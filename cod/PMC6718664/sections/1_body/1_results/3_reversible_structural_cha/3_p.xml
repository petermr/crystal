<p id="Par9">The in situ XRD patterns and calculated variation of 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing for the partially dehydrated Na-bir during electrochemical cycling are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>. Because of the large interlayer distance of partially dehydrated Na-bir, the main Bragg peak representing the interlayer distance is positioned at a low angle below 16°. At the initial state of charge, this Bragg peak is shifted to a higher angle which is attributable to triple corner-sharing Mn or the migration of MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. During discharge, Na ion is intercalated into the spinel-like phase accompanied by a slight increase in 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing. At the depth of discharge of ~30%, this Bragg peak begins to shift to higher angles due to the structural transformation from spinel-like to layered structure. Na ion insertion into the layered structure induced the contraction of interlayer distance by decreasing the oxygen repulsion. Consequently, a new peak of hexagonal layered structure at a high angle emerges, with a total 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing variation of 3.16% at the fully charged state. Up to a state of charge of ~70%, Na ion extraction from the layered structure of partially dehydrated Na-bir is accompanied by an expanded interlayer distance due to the increased oxygen repulsion between MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. After being fully charged during 2nd cycle, the partially dehydrated Na-bir has reverted completely to the spinel-like phase, resultantly demonstrating the full reversibility of the phase transformation. The phase transformation by reversible Mn migration is directly observed by ADF-STEM analysis. For the pristine sample, it is revealed that the spinel-like structure (denoted by the box i) coexists with the layered structure (denoted by box ii) due to the Mn migration into the Na layer during the partial dehydration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). After charge, the desodiation induces the phase transformation to the spinel-like structure in which Mn ions occupy the tetrahedrally coordinated sites by oxygen in the interlayer; the brighter contrast in the interlayer corresponds to this structural feature (denoted by red arrow in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) due to the stronger scattering signal of Mn than that of Na. After discharge, very weak contrast in the interlayer is observed (denoted by red arrow in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). These extra STEM/EDX analysis results (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>) corroborate that the Mn ions in the interlayer are reversibly migrated back to octahedral sites in the transition metal layers during discharge. Altogether, these ex situ and in situ analyses prove the completely reversible phase transformation between the layered and spinel-like structure in partially dehydrated Na-bir during Na ion insertion/extraction. Furthermore, this unique phenomenon is beneficial for its improved cyclic stability and facilitated Na ion diffusivity, which may arise from well-relieved mechanical stress and strain induced by the removal of crystal water and the following structural rearrangement as demonstrated by ex situ analyses including SEM, XPS, ICP-AES, XRD, and TGA after 100 cycles (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Therefore, these results stand in contrast to the conventional paradigm of layered materials, where most of phase transformations including layered-to-spinel and so on are irreversible that need to be suppressed at the expense of limited electrochemical performances. Even if the chronic problems like Mn dissolution, electrolyte decomposition, etc. look much more dominant with hydrated Na-bir, these seem to still affect the partially dehydrated Na-bir badly. So, a search for proper electrolyte in this regime of electrode material may be required to make this breakthrough result more valuable performance-wise.
