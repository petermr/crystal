<p id="p0130">Considering quantum mechanics as applied to molecular quantum transitions, according to the Franck-Condon principle, in optical excitation the electron transition occurs at the turning points of the oscillating nuclei, that is, at the moment they stop. This “reasonable assumption” in quantum mechanics
 <xref rid="fn5" ref-type="fn">5</xref> makes it possible to “switch off” the nuclear subsystem at this time from a dynamic analysis, just as in the framework of quantum mechanics the electronic subsystem is “switched off” from a full-fledged dynamic analysis in a justified procedure to isolate the nonadiabaticity operator in Schrödinger's equation and neglecting it in the adiabatic approximation (see Section
