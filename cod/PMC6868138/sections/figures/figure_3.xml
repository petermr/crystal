  <p>Swimming velocity in time and against the size of the droplets. 
   <bold>a</bold> The velocity of a chiral droplet doped with CB15 evolves in time. Here, the initial diameter of the droplet was ca. 19 μm (data shown for one individual droplet). 
   <bold>b</bold> Velocity of motile droplets as a function of their diameter. These data correspond to a collection of drops, and was acquired during their motion
