<p>The above results demonstrate that simulated spectra based on vibrational analysis accurately reproduced the spectral shapes observed in the experimental SHINERS studies. The modification of atomic coordinates, such as the introduction of O vacancies and hydroxyl species, is known to change the local morphology of SNCs, which, in turn, affects the corresponding vibrational features. Therefore, reproducing unique experimental Raman spectra by simulated vibrational analyses can corroborate these morphological parameters, providing further information regarding the structure-chemical activity correlation of Sn oxide SNCs during the CO oxidation reaction (
