<p>A number of novel high‐silica zeolite structures have been found through exploratory synthesis trials that combine an organic guest molecule, usually a quaternary ammonium compound, with a variety of synthetic conditions. We have recently described how the inorganic conditions chosen in the hydrothermal reaction can bias the crystalline product in terms of the sub‐units likely to occur in the zeolite structure.

This is particularly relevant in the search for materials with high performance in DeNOx reactions in the SCR (selective catalytic reduction) components in diesel emission systems,

High hydroxide levels and the presence of one of a number of alicyclic ring derivatives produce zeolites yielding an optimum DeNOx catalyst once the counter ions have been exchanged with copper or iron cations. In the various zeolite framework types discovered over the last few decades,
