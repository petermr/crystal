<p id="Par8">To achieve all the CRI indices above 95 and the luminous efficacy &gt;100 lm/W simultaneously, we introduced a UV LED chip along with the two blue LEDs in the PKG. We also fabricated one UV and one blue LED chip configuration. However, because of the low efficiency of the UV LED, the overall luminous efficacy of the PKG was well below 100 lm/W. Therefore, we had to use the one UV and two blue LEDs configuration to enhance efficiency. Note that the integration of three LEDs in a chip results in excessive heat generation. Therefore, we designed the heat sink for efficient dissipation of heat. The strategy to introduce a UV LED resulted in an emission band around 470 nm from the green phosphor, which compensated for low CRI
