<p>The wideband sweep signal of transmitting end is generated by 12× multiplier up-converting a chirp signal from 0.667 GHz to 1.083 GHz with a fixed frequency signal at 17.425 GHz. The 0.22 THz frequency multiplier is designed based on GaAs planar Schottky diodes, and its structure is very simple. A planar Schottky varactor flip chip with four anodes arranged in anti-series is mounted onto a quartz based microstrip circuit to realize frequency multiplication. The maximum output power of the transmitter is 14 dBm, and the power flatness is within ±1 dB. The 0.22 THz subharmonic mixer (SHM), used for frequency down-converting in Rx chain, is also designed based on low parasitic component Schottky diodes, and suspended microstrip structure is employed. The conversion loss of the mixer is 9 dB. In order to achieve an ideal range resolution, a good linearity of the chirp signal is necessary. The chirp source in our system is achieved by field programmable gate array (FPGA) and digital-analog converter (DAC) with direct digital synthesis technique, which ensures a high linearity with ns-scale hopping time. The two fixed frequency signals at 17.425 GHz and 17.365 GHz are directly achieved by two coherent phase-locked oscillators and a temperature compensated crystal oscillator, and provide reference frequency for the whole radar system. Based on this signal generation method, the center frequency and bandwidth of the chirp source can be changed flexible according to the future requirement. The sweep pulse width can be set from 10 us to 1 ms, and the pulse repetition frequency can be set from 250 Hz to 10,000 Hz.</p>
