 <caption> Correct answer rate of order parameters. The results are plotted with respect to each equation that gave the same type of order parameter. The x-axis of each graph represents an identification number of each order parameter sorted with respect to the correct answer rate. The results are shown in three different graphs because they can be separated into three tendencies. </caption>
