 </xref> the minimal parasitic energy is plotted as a function of the Henry coefficient, the volumetric working capacity, and the final molar purity. In all three comparisons we see a strong correlation. However, for materials with low parasitic energy, i.e., below 1 MJ/kg where the process is potentially more energy efficient than ammine-based technologies, the correlation becomes less evident. One can, for example, select among the materials with low parasitic energies (that is an index for operative costs) the ones with higher working capacity, that would correspond to the need of less adsorbent (and therefore lower capital costs).
