 <caption> The variation of the theoretically-predicted wavelength of maximum absorption (green triangles), experimentally-observed λ m a x e m i s s i o n attributed to small aggregates (the orange band represented as orange circles), and the experimentally-observed λ m a x e m i s s i o n attributed to larger aggregates or multimers (the red band represented as red squares). The latter shows small variation with pressure above 2.0 GPa. </caption>
