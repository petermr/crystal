<p>The MSD is the mean square of the change of particle position with respect to its initial position at different times, which can reflect the change of particle offset with time. The diffusion coefficient reflects the mobility of the particles, indicating the magnitude of the change of particle position with time, and its magnitude can be derived from the mean square displacement.</p>
