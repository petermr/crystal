<p>We use the steady-state PL intensity to study the optical quality of our films and correlate the introduction of Zn(II) and 3-CPACl with photophysical properties of the film. PL data are normalized for the fraction of absorbed photons at 485 nm (excitation wavelength) to account for any differences in the absorption of the materials at that excitation wavelength. Relative to spin-coated layers of pristine perovskite made and measured under the same conditions, the emission intensity of the films containing Zn(II) incorporation is dramatically enhanced by an order of magnitude and including 2% of 3-CPACl, the intensity is even more boosted (

This implies that nonradiative recombination in the perovskite layer has been significantly suppressed.
