 <caption> Characteristics of the chemical ordering of Mg and Nb. a A schematic rendering of the rocksalt-type partial ordering of Nb and Mg, with the alternate {111} planes occupied by Nb (blue octahedra) and the Mg 2/3Nb 1/3 (magenta octahedra) mixture, respectively. The Pb atoms are represented using yellow spheres. b The Warren–Cowley (W-C) short-range order parameter 30 for the distribution of Mg and Nb, calculated as a function of interatomic distance for the refined configuration. A characteristic length, D, that corresponds to the effective size of chemically ordered regions is indicated. c A 3D distribution of the local chemical short-range order parameter, η (see the Methods section), which varies continuously across the regions of enhanced order. d A 2D map of the local order parameter calculated from the projected Z-map (see text) for the refined configuration as described in ref. 27 . The x and z axes correspond to the [001] and [110] directions, respectively. This map agrees well with its analog derived from the experimental scanning transmission electron microscopy images 26, 27 </caption>
