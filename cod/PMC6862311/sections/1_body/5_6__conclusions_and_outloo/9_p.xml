<p>We also would like to point out that the general mathematical apparatus of AXCCA can be extended beyond X-ray scattering. Usage of electrons as a probe for scattering allows to address problems which can hardly be solved by X-ray diffraction. This includes very thin or weakly scattering samples almost transparent for X-ray, for example very thin LC films [
