<p>The 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II) aptamer domain accommodates the 2′-deoxyribose sugar through a reorganization of five nucleotides in J2/3 (nt 47–51) relative to the guanine/adenine class in a fashion similar to the 2′-dG-I class. The first key difference is the shift of C51 towards C78, which maintains a two hydrogen bond interaction between C51 and 2′-dG (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This shift was first documented in a designed 2′-dG hybrid variant of 
 <italic>xpt</italic> and 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA and was proposed to be essential for 2′-dG recognition (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The second difference between 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II) and guanine/adenine aptamers is the stacking of C47, C48 and U49 to create a pocket for the deoxyribose sugar, which is again similar to the configuration both in a designed 2′-dG hybrid variant of the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> aptamer as well as 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA. The last nucleotide of the stack (U49) interacts differently with the universally conserved U–A pair in P1 between the three classes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">E</xref>). U49 forms a single hydrogen bond with U20–A80 pair while the equivalent uridine residue in guanine/adenine riboswitches forms a two hydrogen bond interaction with the U–A pair. In contrast, the equivalent residue in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I) is a cytosine that does not interact with the U–A pair, but rather interacts with two hydroxyl groups in the backbone. Overall, the 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II) and 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I) aptamers use a similar strategy to create a binding pocket for the deoxyribose sugar.
