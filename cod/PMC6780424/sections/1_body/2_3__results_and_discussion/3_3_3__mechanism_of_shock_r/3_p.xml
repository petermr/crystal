Therefore, the ease of the shock reaction initiation was apparently determined by the trigger bond strength and the temperature rising rate under shock. As a simplification, the specific heat capacity of a compound was the amount of heat needed per unit mass in order to raise the temperature by ΔT. Therefore, a compound with a larger specific heat capacity generally has a smaller TRR. We thereby propose that stronger covalent bonds and higher specific heat capacity are beneficial for delaying the time of shock initiation
