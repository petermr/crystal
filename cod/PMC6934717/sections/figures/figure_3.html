 <caption> ( a) The structure model of EuFe 2As 2 and the surface reconstruction models of arsenic 2 × 1 and europium √2 × √2 terminations. The black boxes outline the unit cells. ( b, c) Topographic images of 2 × 1 surface reconstruction from ‘crystals a’ (−500 mV, 100 pA) and ‘crystal b’ (−1 V, 100 pA), respectively. ( d, e) Topographic images of √2 × √2 surface reconstruction from ‘crystals a’ (−60 mV, 400 pA) and ‘crystal b’ (−20 mV, 800 pA), respectively. Insets show the atomic resolved images in 3 × 3 nm 2 size and black boxes are the unit cells of √2 × √2 surface reconstruction. ( f, g) Comparison of average LDOS from ‘crystal a’ (red) and ‘crystal b’ (blue), for surface reconstructions at 4.2 K. </caption>
