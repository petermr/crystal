<p>In order to identify the dominant diffusion mechanism during the creep deformation process, the models with a grain size of 4.5 nm at 1200 K and 1400 K were selected under the stress levels of 2.0 GPa (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-02508">Video S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Files</xref>). Representative atomic snapshots of the microstructure changes with time are presented in in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Color coding was applied on each grain in order to better clarify the creep mechanism. Different colors are only used to distinguish different grains, and the colors themselves are meaningless.
