 </inline-formula>-stack would support such an assumption. The red band could than be assumed to originate from excitations involving more complicated multimers, in accordance with the former time-resolved study. As the increased pressure forces molecules closer together, the formation of the latter, many-component multimers can occur almost instantly, and emission from such multimers would dominate the spectrum. It must be stated that more definite conclusions could only be made based on a pressure-dependent time-resolved luminescence study, which would allow comparing luminescence decay-times of the orange and red bands.
