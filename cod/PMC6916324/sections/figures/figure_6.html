 <caption> Side views of (a) the (011) face, and (b) the (110) face, of Co 3(PO 4) 2 shown as ball‐and‐stick models. Colors: Co is brown, O is red, and P is magenta. The arrows indicate Co atom pairs with a short distance 3.032 Å between them. The iso‐surfaces show two of the MLWFs (±0.08 Å −3) from Figure  5 f for the (011) face and Figure  5 d for the (110) face that have their upward‐pointing lobes pointing towards negative charge‐depletion regions around the respective Co ions. Charge analysis was carried out for the bulk crystal. </caption>
