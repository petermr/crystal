<p id="Par14">The synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns for the Ti
 <sub>75</sub>Ni
 <sub>15</sub>Cu
 <sub>10</sub> and Ti
 <sub>10</sub>Ni
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>40</sub> multilayered thin film before and after annealing are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The crystalline peak disappeared completely with annealing in Ti
 <sub>75</sub>Ni
 <sub>15</sub>Cu
 <sub>10</sub>, indicating that the amorphous phase was formed before any crystalline phase nucleated. In contrast, the peak of Ti
 <sub>10</sub>Ni
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>40</sub> became sharper even though the height was decreased. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d,e</xref>, the as-deposited precursors with strong orientation became randomly oriented polycrystalline during annealing. Thus, the initial stronger diffraction spot was spread out to a complete ring, resulting in narrower but weaker signals received by the detector. According to the ICSD database, Ti
 <sub>10</sub>Ni
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>40</sub> is likely to crystallize into intermetallic compounds of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Ni
 <sub>4</sub> (No. 105422) and Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Cu
 <sub>4</sub> (No. 103134) during the solid-state reaction at this temperature.
