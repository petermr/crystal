<p>Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrometer was used to record excitation and emission spectra of the synthesized samples. This spectrometer was equipped with double grating Czerny-Turner excitation and emission monochromators, a 450 W ozone-free xenon arc lamp, and cooled (−20 °C) SPC photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928P). The recorded PL emission spectra were corrected for instrument response by a correction file provided by Edinburgh Instruments (Livingston, UK). A reference detector (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK) was used to correct the excitation spectra.</p>
