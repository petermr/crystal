<p id="Par15">The second TL, which is only about half filled has a height of 3.57 Å which is much closer to the respective bulk value. The crystal structure of bulk BiI
 <sub>3</sub> shows two distinct sets of Bi–I interatomic distances alternating in the first coordination polyhedron of each bismuth atom, i.e. 3.054 Å and 3.125 Å

 </sup>. Such distortions ensure the highest density of TL packing

 </sup>. Furthermore, the lone-pair effect on bismuth manifests itself in symmetrical shifts of adjacent Bi atoms in the opposite directions from the ideal site in the middle of the octahedral iodine environment (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The same effects but with a larger magnitude are observed in the second TL. For instance, the Bi # 7 atom shifts by 0.4 Å from the middle position within an octahedron, and variations in the alternating longer and shorter interatomic Bi–I distances reach 0.5 Å. In general, the second TL of the BiI
 <sub>3</sub> film demonstrates a bonding pattern characteristic for the bulk structure. One may argue that the formation of the bulk structure already commences as the second TL grows atop of the first TL, and that with it the accompanying bulk effects associated with the optimum packing emerge. The weak interlayer interaction nevertheless defines the mutual arrangement of the TL’s and their distortions, just like in the periodic crystal structure.
