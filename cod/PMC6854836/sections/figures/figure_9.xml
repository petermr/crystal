  <p>(a) Structural fragment of α-SiB
   <sub>3–
    <italic>x</italic>
   </sub>, model 
   <bold>4</bold>, as determined by SC-XRD; Si and B atoms are shown in red and green, respectively. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level. Coordination polyhedra are drawn transparent and nontransparent and connect only to B
   <sup>p,B</sup> atoms at the disordered site. (b) Projection of the exo-bond (dashed orange line) onto the plane defined by arrows in (a). Note that the dashed black lines and dashed atoms are out of plane.
