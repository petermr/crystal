<p>In experimental mechanics techniques that measure displacements and derivatives of displacements, two basic approaches are utilized. One approach is the direct measurements of distances changes through strain gages methods. The other approach is to apply tagged carriers, either deterministic or random carriers and through optical means create images of the carriers in a reference condition, and in a loaded condition. Then, the changes in the field are computed by the difference between reference configuration and loaded configuration. The scalar fields of gray levels are transformed in vectorial fields corresponding to deformations by either optical correlation generating fringes in the case of deterministic signals (moir√© fringes) or by numerical correlation in the case of discrete image correlation (DIC).</p>
