<p>The ellipsometry measurements to determine surface oxide thickness were performed using a variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry system (J.A. Woollam Co. Inc.) under ambient conditions. The incident angle of light used in the study was 70Â°, and the wavelength range was from 300 to 2000 nm with wavelength increments of 10 nm.</p>
