<p>The simplest resonator is F-P and is formed by two parallel mirrors, one of which is partially transparent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,c). This configuration allows the emitted light to propagate along the axis of amplifying materials, thus resulting in the amplification of the emission. In some cases, the initial reflectivity on the cleaved facets of semiconductor crystal served as active medium at the interface with air is sufficient enough to create a resonator. Most of the lasers based on F-P resonators are multimode. DBRâ€“based resonator consists of multiple layers of materials with different refractive index (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). On boundary between the layers, a constructive interference for waves with specific wavelength can occur. The efficiency of reflectance of a light emitted by an active medium in DBR resonator reaches 99%, thus this type of resonator is highly utilized in different laser systems such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) where quantum wells or thin films of luminescent material are used as active medium. WGM-based resonator is formed by a concave surface where a total optical internal reflection occurs for specific waves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). Thus, a light propagates inside the spherical cavity and amplifies by the interaction with the excited atoms in active medium. RL is not a resonator itself since the optical feedback in this case is provided by scattering particles in active medium, which can also emit light (
