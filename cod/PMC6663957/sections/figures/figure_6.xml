 <caption>
  <p>Images and line profiles of the point source simulated inside the 
   <italic>Scanner B</italic> reconstructed using OSEM algorithm with six subsets and 24 subiterations. 
   <bold>a</bold> Cylindrical geometry. 
   <bold>b</bold> Block geometry. The top (bottom) row of line profiles is tangentially (radially) drawn across the point source. The position of the point source in the top row corresponds to those in the bottom row. The point source located at the center of the scanner moves radially till 25 mm with steps of 5 mm
