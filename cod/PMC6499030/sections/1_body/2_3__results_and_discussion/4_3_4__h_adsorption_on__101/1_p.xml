<p>The adsorption mechanism for H investigated here corresponds to the R arrangement in the DFT study by Leconte et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), since this was found to be the most favorable adsorption mode. A hydrogen atom is adsorbed onto a surface oxygen atom, upon which a reduction of a nearby titanium atom takes place. In our calculation, a neutral H atom is adsorbed to O
 <sup>2−</sup> resulting in the formation of OH
 <sup>−</sup> and the donation of an electron to the surface CB.
