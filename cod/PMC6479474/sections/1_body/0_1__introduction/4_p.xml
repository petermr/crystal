<p>In the literature so far, quantum chemical calculation vibrational studies of melamine have been limited to finite models and harmonic approximation [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Mircescu et al. have harmonically calculated IR and Raman spectra of melamine [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. They have used the single molecule model, and cluster of 10 melamine molecules. They have compared the spectra that were calculated with these two approaches and judged that the 10 molecule cluster model leads to a better quality of the calculated IR and Raman spectra of melamine. They concluded that the hydrogen-bonding of melamine in crystal needs to be taken into account in order to yield accurate calculated vibrational spectra. Accordingly, the calculations that are based on the 10 molecule cluster have led to much improved simulated IR and Raman spectra. Yuan et al. have drawn similar conclusions [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in their quantum mechanical calculations of IR spectra of melamine. They have used a single molecule model, a four-molecule cluster with two hydrogen-bonds, and a large cluster consisting of 32 molecules of melamine featuring 30 intermolecular hydrogen-bonds. They have compared the IR spectra that were calculated on the basis of these models and concluded that proper representation of the hydrogen-bonded structure of melamine is essential in improving the quality of the calculated IR spectrum [
