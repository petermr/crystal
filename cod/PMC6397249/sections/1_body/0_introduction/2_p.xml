<p id="Par3">Gold is widely used in luxury products such as jewelry, watches, and ornamental articles. Pure gold metal is soft, ductile, and is easily scratched and worn away. As such, gold is most widely used in an alloyed form. Gold alloys have been developed over centuries to exhibit combinations of optical properties (color and appearance), strength, hardness, corrosion and wear resistance to meet the requirements and needs of this application. Commonly used gold alloys are classified by hallmarking criteria that characterizes the weight fraction of the gold content. For commercial luxury products, meeting a specified hallmark is a basic requirement. Commercial gold alloys are further distinguished by their optical properties, more specifically their color. Gold alloys are classified broadly as “yellow gold”, “white gold”, “rose gold”, “green gold”, etc. The alloy color is controlled by combining various alloying elements with pure gold to form a gold alloy.</p>
