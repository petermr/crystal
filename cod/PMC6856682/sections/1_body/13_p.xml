<p>In summary, we have prepared a new anionic Fe complex 
 <bold>1</bold> incorporating a chelating phosphinine ligand. Complex 
 <bold>1</bold> exists in solution as a pair of isomers in which the phosphinine adopts distinct coordination modes at the metal. Both isomers react with CO
 <sub>2</sub>: for the π‐coordinated isomer 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> addition of CO
 <sub>2</sub> to a carbon atom of the phosphinine moiety is observed, while full cleavage of one C=O bond occurs in the σ‐coordinated isomer 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> to give an Fe‐coordinated CO moiety and P‐bound O atom. This is the first reported example of C=O cleavage of a CO
 <sub>2</sub> molecule mediated by a single Fe centre, and clearly demonstrates the potential of coordinatively and electronically flexible phosphinine ligands to help mediate challenging bond‐activation reactions. Research into the further applications of such complexes, the derivatisation of CO
 <sub>2</sub> cleavage product 
 <bold>3‐σ</bold>, and the use of these systems to address the crucial and topical challenge of efficient CO
 <sub>2</sub> transformation are currently underway in our laboratories.
