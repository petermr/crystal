<p>In this context, we propose a novel wind speed sensor based on a wind‐driven luminescence device and a photodetector (PD), so as to utilize the high output current of the PD. Mechanoluminescence (ML) is the emission of luminescence that is activated by mechanical stress. Due to the low critical wind speed and large amplitude, ML has been induced by wind‐induced flutter vibration on the elastic ZnS:Cu+PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane).

 <xref rid="advs1381-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> reported that the bright white wind‐driven ML could only be observed at speeds higher than 30 m s
