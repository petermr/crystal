<p>This paper presents a meal delivery robot with positioning and navigation control based on the fusion of information from multiple sources or technologies, namely UWB positioning, an odometer, a low-cost gyroscope accelerometer, and an electronic compass. We establish the kinematics model of the delivery robot. To improve the positioning accuracy and stability effectively, we fuse the positioning results of the UWB system with those of odometer and a dead reckoning algorithm. The algorithm used for the fusion is an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusion algorithm, which is suitable for discrete systems in the presence of Gaussian white noise. The designed robot can move along the preset path without the need for laying a navigation track. Moreover, when the restaurant changes its layout, we need to modify only the default track in the software.</p>
