<p id="Par39">At this point, it should be noted once more that the present 
 <italic>semi-kinematical</italic> approach embraces the inverse XRDT problem even if alternative algorithm codes have to be applied. On the other hand, a convergence of the optimization procedure for the target function based on the SA and qNGD algorithm codes might be improved by exploiting a number of the true XRDT 2D projections and, besides, some modifications of the SA and qNGD algorithm codes 
 <italic>in use</italic>. The question of whether the elaborated theoretical approach overall is effective or whether it should be given up in favor of other approaches, which should be applied instead, remains a good topic for future work.
