<p>Nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> synthesized at different rotating speeds of packing in IS-RPB and calcined at 500 °C is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f003">Figure 3</xref>; the nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is spherical and granular. With the increase of the rotating speed of packing, the particle size decreases gradually. This is mainly because, at a higher rotating speed, the liquid microelement cut by the packing is smaller, and the liquid microelement has a faster coagulation and dispersion rate, resulting in a better microscopic mixing effect. The precipitation reaction occurs in a more uniform and higher supersaturation environment. When the rotating speed of packing is 1200 rpm, because the surface energy of small particles is higher, the dispersion and uniformity of particle sizes are obviously worse than TiO
 <sub>2</sub> synthesized at rotating speeds of 400 and 800 rpm. In fact, the particle sizes at 400 rpm and 800 rpm are, respectively, about 25 ± 5 nm and 13 ± 3 nm from the SEM images, and the spherical granular structure is also obvious. However, due to the serious agglomeration phenomenon, there is no obvious spherical granular structure at 1200 rpm from the SEM images, and the particles have a wide particle size distribution. The better dispersion and uniform particle sizes are better for the production and application of nanomaterials, and so the best speed in the experiment is 800 rpm. TEM shows that the particle size of nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> obtained under 800 rpm was about 12.5 nm.
