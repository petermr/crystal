<p>As an illustration of the use of these COFs, we screened the materials for their performance to separate CO
 <sub>2</sub> from flue gases in a case study in which these materials are use to capture carbon from a coal-fired power plant followed by geological sequestration of the captured CO
 <sub>2</sub>. In our model, we mimic a temperatureâ€“pressure swing process to separate CO
 <sub>2</sub> from coal postcombustion flue gases and its compression to 150 bar for underground storage. The aim is to find the materials that give the lowest parasitic energy. This parasitic energy is defined as the loss of electricity production caused by separation and compression of 1 kg of CO
 <sub>2</sub>.

 </sup> To evaluate this energy we need to predict the pure component isotherms of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and N
 <sub>2</sub> in the COFs at 300 K, as evaluated from grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations.

 <sub>2</sub> parasitic energy from the optimized structures, provided with DDEC charges. The full workflow is sketched in
