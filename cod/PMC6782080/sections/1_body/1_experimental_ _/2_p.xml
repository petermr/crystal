<p>Synthesis of ZnO nanospikes was conducted following the flame-transport approach (Mishra 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb38"> ▸</xref>), in which Zn microparticles with typical diameters of 10 µm are mixed homogenously into a slurry of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) powder and ethanol. A typical weight ratio for Zn:PVB:ethanol is 1:2:6, which can be varied depending upon the requirements for morphology and specific applications. Further steps involve coating of Si substrates via a slip-casting technique and subsequent heating inside a simple muffle-type box furnace to 873 K for 1 h with a ramp rate of 100 K min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The PVB–ethanol mixture thereby acts as a sacrificial spacing layer between the particles which decomposes completely at elevated temperatures.
