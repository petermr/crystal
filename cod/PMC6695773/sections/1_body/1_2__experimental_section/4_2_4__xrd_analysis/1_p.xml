<p>In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements during cooling process (320 K → 93 K) and heating process (93 K → 320 K) were carried out on a Bruker AXS D8 equipment (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) using Cu K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation with a wavelength of 1.54056 Å under a scanning rate of 2°/min. Ni-plated copper sample holder was fixed on the cooling or heating block. The cooling block was cooled by a continuous liquid nitrogen flow, and the heating block contained a heating strip made of AlCr. The new phase’s crystal structure was also solved using JADE (6.5 version, Livermore, CA, United States) and Jana software (2006 version, Praha, Czech Republic).
