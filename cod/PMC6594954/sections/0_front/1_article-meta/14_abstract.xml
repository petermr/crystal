 <p id="Par2">Beryllium in inorganic compounds is usually coordinated to four oxygen atoms, but higher coordination numbers have been predicted. Here the authors observe a pressure induced stepwise transition in CaBe
  <sub>2</sub>P
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>8</sub> where Be coordination changes to trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral, implying that d orbitals are not mandatory for high coordination.
