<p id="Par12">What is not expected for a simple dimer antiferromagnet is the decrease in intensity observed at 2.6 meV (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), which is almost independent of the scattering wave vector, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> by contour maps of intensities sliced at a constant energy. Apparently, the energy slice at 2.60 meV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) exhibits much weaker intensities than those at 2.48 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and 2.72 meV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Note that this intensity decrease at 2.6 meV is not due to an extrinsic effect, because it is unchanged under different measuring conditions (different incident energy 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> and temperature, see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The detailed 
 <italic>Q</italic> dependence of the triplon bands is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, which represents 
 <italic>Q</italic> slices of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> as functions of energy transfer 
 <italic>E</italic>. At small 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic>, two peaks along the 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic> directions overlap. At 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic> of 0.68 r.l.u., they start to move apart and form two well-separated peaks. The right peak at 2.50 meV decreases and disappears above 0.80 r.l.u., while the left peak becomes more prominent with increasing 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic>. Above 0.68 r.l.u., the new peak emerges at 2.68 meV and grows in intensity as 
 <italic>H</italic> or 
 <italic>K</italic> increases toward 1.00 r.l.u.
