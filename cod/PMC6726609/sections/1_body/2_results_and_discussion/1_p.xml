 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> offers schematic illustration of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires and α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction nanorods preparation. The α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires as precursors were first fabricated via a mild (water and ethanol) and low-temperature (80 °C) water bath shaking method. Then the α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheet is based on the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowire, the whole covers its surface and further forms α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction nanorods. Compared with smooth nanowires, heterojunction structure with the pleated sheet surface expands the contact between the material and electrolyte, further promoting the ion transport. The diffraction patterns of X-ray diffraction (XRD) are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. For nanowires sample, the critical position of the peak at about 12.3°, 33.58° and 39.5° are match with (003), (012) and (015) facets of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> respectively
 <sup>

 </sup>. After the nickel hydroxide coating process, a strengthened peak appeared at 59.4°, which corresponds to (300) crystal plane of α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. This result confirms the α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> is successfully bonded to the surface of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. To fully prove the coexistence of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, the complex was further investigate by XPS test (the specific details are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the presence of peaks at 44.6°, 51.9° and 76.4° are caused by introducing a small amount of nickel foam due to ultrasonic treatment for samples. The XRD data indicates that the as- fabricated Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> all demonstrate alike structure with α phase. To further verify the internal structure of the synthesized materials, the FTIR spectrum of pure α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction hybrid are present in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The bands located at 2924 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2852 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which belongs to the asymmetric and symmetric CH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching of alkyl amine
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. The bands at 3445 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 640 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are due to the O-H stretching modes of interlayer water molecules and H-bound of OH groups, and the band at 1628 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is proved to the bending vibration mode of the water molecules
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. The band appears at 1382 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is attributed to the existence of interlayer nitrate anion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. The 2220 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to the vibration of interlayer OCN
 <sup>−1</sup> anions, which further confirm the presence of α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> because it only occurs in the example of nickel hydroxide
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. The strong peaks at 2025 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to the absorption peak of carbonyl group
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>, and relative intensity of the peak in the heterojunction structure is much weaker, which illustrates that amount of NH
 <sub>2</sub>COO
 <sup>−</sup> anions have been reduced after second reaction. A small loss of anions may help the heterogeneous material with a two-dimensional layered crystal structure opens up more space to facilitate ion of dissociation, leading to high ion transport rate. As can be seen from the schematic diagram of crystal structure of materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), the large space between layers obviously facilitates the shuttling and movement of ions, which fully confirms the advantages of layered materials. The TEM images verified α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires existed within the flake structure of α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e–g</xref>), indicating the successful construction of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction.
