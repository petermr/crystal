<p>The second direct base-base interaction promoted by the insertion element is via adenosine 77. In other purine riboswitch family members, this nucleotide is coplanar with a Y22-R52 Watson–Crick pair above the ligand-binding triple in the three-way junction. In 
 <italic>xpt</italic>, the U22–A52 base pair forms a water-mediated interaction with A73 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), while in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA the equivalent nucleotide is too distant to form a direct or indirect interaction (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, in the 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II) structure, A77 forms a direct two hydrogen bond interaction with the U22–A52 base pair, establishing a direct base triple between the three joining strands of the junction (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). The role of this interaction in ligand binding affinity is revealed by an A77U mutation, which disrupts the base triple and weakens 2′-dG binding affinity by ∼7-fold. The equivalent A73C mutation in 
 <italic>xpt</italic> riboswitch aptamer results in only a two-fold decrease in ligand binding affinity (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Thus, the unique insertion element of the 2′-dG-II class promotes two new base-mediated interactions that further organizes the three-way junction at the base of the P3 helix, thereby increasing ligand binding affinity.
