<p>The intermolecular hydrogen bond A:H–D (with “:” representing the electron lone pair, A for acceptor and D for donor) integrates the H–D polar-covalent bond, the A:H nonbond, and the A–D repulsive coupling interaction. Under shock, the hydrogen bonds show their elasticity—the covalent bond segment contracts and the nonbond elongates [

 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The special elasticity allows hydrogen bonds to vibrate in a continuous frequency region (&lt;200 cm
