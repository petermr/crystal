<p>For TEM sample preparation from freestanding ZnO nanospikes, the geometric shadow-FIB technique enabled the preparation of several cross-section specimens in one FIB lamella. The individual preparation steps are displayed in Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>. Experimental problems with charging effects and the support material were circumvented by embedding the ZnO nanospikes in amorphous carbon by decomposing a naphthalene precursor with the electron beam [Fig. 2

Note that at this high voltage (the optimum is ∼2 kV) the deposition rate is much lower, so this step took about 45 min. After cutting trenches to either side [Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>b</italic>)] and lifting the lamella out, the sample was mounted on a needle followed by an

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>d</italic>)], the silicon and the edges on either side were left relatively thick.
