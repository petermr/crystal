<p>It was found that all the elastic constants increased with the increasing external hydrostatic pressure. This pressure dependence characteristic of the elastic constants could be attributed to the covalent bond behavior with the increasing pressure. The

 <sub>22</sub>, with the slowest growth rate, also increases by a factor of 3.5 with the applied external pressure. Moreover, the values of

 <sub>33</sub> and

 <sub>23</sub> have an obvious jump near 34 GPa. These elastic constant jumps at phase transition pressure are typical in second-order continuous structure phase transitions [

 <sub>33</sub> is close to

 <italic>Pnma</italic> phase. The weaker elasticity indicates weaker atomic bonds. Therefore, deformation occurs more easily along the c axis, in accordance with the previous discussion about structural phase transitions. However, the elastic constants

 <sub>44</sub> (
