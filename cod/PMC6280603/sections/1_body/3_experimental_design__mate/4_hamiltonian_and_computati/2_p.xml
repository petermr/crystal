 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> has been adopted for all calculations. The exchange-correlation contribution is performed over a grid of points and is the result of a numerical integration of the electron density and its gradient. The adopted pruned grid is given by 75 points and 974 angular points (XLGRID) and obtained from The Gauss–Legendre quadrature and Lebedev schemes 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The tolerance thresholds that control accuracy of the Coulomb and exchange integrals were set to 10
 <sup>−7</sup> and 10
 <sup>−16</sup>, respectively
