 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> showed that the natural matrix albite in this experiment contained small amounts of C, Ca, and Eu elements, except the main elements Na, Al, Si, O. The atomic percentage of the main elements is 0.85:1:2.6:8.3, close to the atomic percentage of albite 1:1:3:8, and the percentage of the weight of the Eu element was 0.03%. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> shows element distribution mapping of natural sodium feldspar, Na, Al, Si, O and a small amount of impurity Ca and Eu as impurity can be seen evenly in the map. However, the distribution density of the trace component Eu is uneven, which is concentrated in a certain part of the natural sodium feldspar. Therefore, assumed that Eu in natural minerals may not form luminescent center. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> shows element distribution mapping of thermally-treated natural sodium feldspar, after treatment, Eu elements are slightly dispersed. In the following passage, natural sodium feldspar in this experiment will be denoted by natural NaAlSi
