<p id="Par13">CHO has an orthorhombic structure with a pseudocubic lattice constant of 3.990 Å; STO has a cubic lattice constant of 3.905 Å. The good matching of their lattices makes CHO a natural gating and insulating material for STO-based oxide devices

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> had shown that both the crystalline and the amorphous CHO films grown on STO exhibit excellent dielectric properties with a relative dielectric constant around 17, comparable with LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub> or HfO
 <sub>2</sub> (note that HfO
 <sub>2</sub> is replacing SiO
 <sub>2</sub> as the gating and insulating material in commercial integrated circuits). Here, we demonstrate that the CHO/STO of both terminations can be used to fabricate field-effect devices.
