<p id="Par26">Vickers hardness (HV0.5) was measured on 20 mm × 20 mm × 1 mm plate coupons using a Vickers microhardness tester with an indenter having a width of 40 μm. Since the average size of the microstructural features in the MGMCs is below 5 μm, the indenter size is considered sufficiently large to provide a representative average hardness. Eight tests were performed where micro-indentions were inserted on a flat and polished cross section of a rod. A load of 500 g and a duel time of 10 s were used.</p>
