<p>The information from the publications starting from 2017 is summarized in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03845-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> where the champion devices are shown. The analysis showed that the highest quality values, Q, are achieved for the single crystal perovskite microcavities with WGM resonator type. In [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], a Q = 10,100 was achieved in all-inorganic CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> microcuboids with emission in green spectral region. The second efficient resonator in a frame of the highest Q value is VCSEL for which Q = 5400 was registered with CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> thin films used as active medium [
 <xref rid="B120-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. For lasers implementing F-P type resonators, the maximal Q value of 2500 was achieved for MAPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> microcrystals [
 <xref rid="B81-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. For the RL case, the highest Q value of 1040 was registered for 2D R-P layers [
 <xref rid="B111-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Thus, the synthetic routes, which determine the morphology of the nanostructured perovskite materials, also affect the type of a laser.
