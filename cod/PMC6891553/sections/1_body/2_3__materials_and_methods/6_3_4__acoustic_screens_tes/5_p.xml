<p>From the reference SCAS to the real size, the parameters were adjusted for a scaling factor of 1:8. Taking into account that the Bragg frequency would also be transferred according to the scale factor, the Bragg attenuation frequency for these scaled SCASs was in the 8 kHz band. By setting a filling factor of 0.25 (thin SCAS) and 0.45 (thick SCAS) to analyze the different cases, the resulting design parameters of both scaled SCAS are shown in
