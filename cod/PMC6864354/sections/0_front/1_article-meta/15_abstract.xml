 <p>In this data article, using density functional theory calculations, it is shown that in the gas phase, free from crystal packing effects, different elongation and compression Jahn-Teller geometries of 
  <italic>fac</italic> and 
  <italic>mer</italic> tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) are possible. A careful construction of input geometries made it possible to obtain the density functional theory calculated optimized geometries of different elongation and compression Jahn-Teller geometries of 
  <italic>fac</italic> and 
  <italic>mer</italic> tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III). The 
  <italic>mer</italic> CF
  <sub>3</sub>–CF
  <sub>3</sub> elongation isomer has the lowest energy (Fig. 1), while in the solid state a 
  <italic>mer</italic> CH
  <sub>3</sub>–CH
  <sub>3</sub> compression tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) isomer is experimentally characterized [1]. The rare experimental example of a compression tris(β-diketonato)-manganese(III) structure is ascribed to intermolecular F⋯F and F⋯H interactions between the tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) molecules in the solid crystalline state, contributing to the distortion of the coordination polyhedron of tris(trifluoroacetylacetonato)-manganese(III) from the expected elongation Jahn-Teller geometry, to the observed higher energy electronic state with compression Jahn-Teller distortion.
