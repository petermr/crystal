<p>For geometry optimization, we considered the atomic positions to be converged once the maximum force on the atoms dropped below 1.0 millihartree/bohr (as well as a root-mean squared value below 0.7). The threshold for the pressure is set to 100 bar for the cell optimization. For the first stage (preliminary cell optimization) the BFGS minimizer is used. For the second stage (AIMD), an NPT_F
