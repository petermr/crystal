<p id="Par20">Again two atoms were randomly picked and this process of hybrid-MC/MD was repetitively carried out until the number of attempted swaps reached 50 swaps per atoms i.e. 583200 attempted swaps. During the entire simulation the potential energy as well as the coordinates of the system were recorded at intervals.</p>
