 <p>High refractive index nanoparticle material was applied as a scattering layer on the inner side of a glass substrate of a bottom emission organic light emitting diode (OLED) device to enhance light extraction and to improve angular color shift. TiO
  <sub>2</sub> and YSZ (Yttria Stabilized Zirconia; Y
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub>-ZrO
  <sub>2</sub>) were examined as the high refractive index nanoparticles. The nanoparticle material was formed as a scattering layer on a glass substrate by a coating method, which is generally used in the commercial display manufacturing process. Additionally, a planarization layer was coated on the scattering layer with the same method. The implemented nanoparticle material and planarization material endured, without deformation, the subsequent thermal annealing process, which was carried out at temperature ranged to 580 Â°C. We demonstrated a practical and highly efficient OLED device using the conventional display manufacturing process by implementing the YSZ nanoparticle. We obtained a 38% enhanced luminance of the OLED device and a decreased angular color change compared to a conventional OLED device.
