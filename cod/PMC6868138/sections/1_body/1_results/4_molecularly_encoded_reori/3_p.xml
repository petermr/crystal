<p id="Par21">We have investigated the behavior of the spiral droplets when helix inversion occurs slowly, i.e., when a lower intensity of irradiation is used (ca. 8 s). In such experimental conditions, the liquid crystal is allowed to transition in the compensated nematic state, where chirality is not expressed because the chiral contributions of the motor isomers compensate each other. As the number of spiral turns decreases in the droplet, the radius of the helical motion decreases and eventually the droplet swims along a straight trajectory that merges with the axis of the helical trajectory, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> where the achiral organization is associated with straight, linear motion. The angle between the helical and the straight trajectory was consistently smaller than the angle of reorientation that is associated with a sharp helix inversion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>). As the chiral information is gradually lost, there is enough time for the surfactant to redistribute around the droplet in the new configuration that appears gradually, therefore there is no flow induced by the diffusion of surfactant at the droplet surface associated with the reorganization of the spiral structure of the droplets, which would drive the droplet away from the initial direction of the helical motion.
