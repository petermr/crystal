<p>The synthesis temperature seems to have minor impact on the formation of phase‐pure products, but at temperatures far below the optimum of 200 °C, a drastically shrinking of the average crystal size was observed. Cooling rates of −5 K/h and reaction times of at least 2 d provided single‐crystals of

 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), although completely crystalline products can be received with holding times lower than 10 h. Significantly larger platelets of
