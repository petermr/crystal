<p id="Par28">Again, using the above elasticity model, the total energy due to the dislocation-jog interactions and the jog self formation is calculated. By setting 
 <italic>α</italic> in the self energy expression to be 3.5, the prediction of the elasticity model of the energy changes due to the jog formation/vacancy dissociation on the screw dislocation is in close agreement with the atomistic modeling results, ranging from −0.53 eV to −0.67 eV depending on the jog pair separation width (2.7 Å–30 Å). This suggests that the total energy dependence on the jog pair separation width is quite weak. Taking the largest energy change due to the jog formation (−0.61 eV) in the atomistic modeling results, the elasticity model prediction is considered to be in fairly good agreement with our atomistic modeling results.
