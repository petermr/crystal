 <caption> Field-effect transistors with in situ annealed 8-uc CaHfO 3/SrTiO 3 (CHO/STO) heterointerfaces. a Sketch of a device. The channel is 10 μm in width and 100 μm in length. The top gate electrode is a 100-nm-thick silver film. Drain-source current ( I DS) versus drain-source voltage ( V DS) at different gate-source voltages ( V GS) for b CHO grown on TiO 2-terminated STO (T-STO) and c SrO-terminated STO (S-STO). All data were measured at room temperature </caption>
