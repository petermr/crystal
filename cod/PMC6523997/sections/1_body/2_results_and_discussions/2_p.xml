<p>The introduction of Zn (II) does not affect significantly the typical XRD pattern shown by the pristine material which results in a pseudocubic crystal structure (

 </xref>a) as reported before for this material.

 </sup> To corroborate the presence of Zn(II) in the perovskite lattice, which presumably occupies Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> sites, the magnification of the two highest diffraction peaks is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>b. Both peaks show a 0.05° 2θ shift to higher values, indicating a contraction of the elementary cell in agreement with the smaller ionic radius of Zn(II). The (110) peak shifts from 13.89° to 13.94°, while the (220) peak shifts from 28.09° to 28.13°. As result, the pseudocubic lattice parameter is reduced from 6.3710 to 6.3474 Å. With Zn(II) introduction, the material shows improved crystallinity supported by the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) value reduction from 0.2799 to 0.1877.
