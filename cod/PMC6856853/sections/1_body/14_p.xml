<p>The infrared spectrum of 
 <bold>4</bold> shows 5 stretches at 1940, 2034, 2054, 2065, and 2114 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for the CO and As−H vibrations. In the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>4</bold>, a singlet at 3.9 ppm can be attributed to the H atom of the AsH unit. In order to clearly attribute the As−H stretches and hence to prove the presence of the AsH unit, we performed the reaction of 
 <bold>2D</bold> with [Cr(CO)
 <sub>5</sub>(thf)]. To our surprise, the same reaction product 
 <bold>4</bold> was isolated instead of the expected deuterated complex [{Fe
 <sub>2</sub>(CO)
 <sub>8</sub>}AsD{Cr(CO)
 <sub>5</sub>}]. 
 <sup>2</sup>H NMR and IR spectroscopic investigations indicate that the H/D exchange occurs during the reaction and not during the column chromatographic workup, since the resonance signal corresponding to [{Fe
 <sub>2</sub>(CO)
 <sub>8</sub>}AsD{Cr(CO)
 <sub>5</sub>}] is not present in the 
 <sup>2</sup>H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture. In the EI mass spectrum of 
 <bold>4</bold>, the molecular ion peak could be detected at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic>=603.68 as well as peaks corresponding to the consecutive loss of all carbonyl groups, the hydrogen and the arsenic atom.
