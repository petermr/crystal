 <bold>2</bold> shows the clear vibronic progressions upon cooling, while the emission maximum wavelength is almost insensitive to 
 <italic>T</italic>. The complex, 
 <bold>2</bold>, exhibits single exponential emission decay irrespective of 
 <italic>T</italic> and the τ
 <sub>em</sub> value increased with decreasing 
 <italic>T</italic> in 120 &lt; 
 <italic>T</italic> &lt; 296 K, while it was almost constant at 118–122 μs below 120 K. The rate constant (

 <sup>2+</sup> in MeOH/EtOH at room temperature decreases significantly with decreasing

 <sup>5</sup> s
 <sup>–1</sup> at 296 K to 1.8–2.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> s
 <sup>–1</sup> at 77 K because thermal deactivation of the emissive excited state of the complex through the upper-energy-lying metal-centered excited state is suppressed at lower temperature.

 </sup> The small variation of the 
 <italic>k</italic> value with 
 <italic>T</italic> and the high Φ
 <sub>em</sub> value of 
 <bold>2</bold> will be due to almost no contribution of thermal activation to the nonradiative metal-centered state to excited state decay of 
 <bold>2</bold>.

 <bold>2</bold> and

 <sub>em</sub> values were observed between those of

 <bold>5</bold> (λ
 <sub>em</sub> = 561 nm, weighted average τ
 <sub>em</sub> = 0.070 μs, Φ
 <sub>em</sub> &lt; 0.01). In particular, the Φ
 <sub>em</sub> value of 
 <bold>5</bold> is significantly smaller than those of 
 <bold>2</bold> and the other new complexes. The spectral feature showing vibronic progressions of 
 <bold>5</bold> is very similar to 
 <bold>2</bold> at 80 K. Therefore, the emissive excited state of

 <sub>π</sub>(N
 <sup>3–</sup>)–d
 <sub>π</sub> overlap, and the weak luminescence of 
 <bold>5</bold> is the result of quenching of the emissive excited state of the complex. In the Mim coordinate complexes, both 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> showed almost comparable spectroscopic and photophysical properties: λ
 <sub>em</sub> = 536 nm, τ
 <sub>em</sub> = 55 μs, and Φ
 <sub>em</sub> = 0.65 for 
 <bold>3</bold> and λ
 <sub>em</sub> = 537 nm, τ
 <sub>em</sub> = 52 μs, and Φ
 <sub>em</sub> = 0.65 for 
 <bold>6</bold>. The Φ
 <sub>em</sub> and τ
 <sub>em</sub> data observed for 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> are, thus, in sharp contrast to those of 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>. As described in the part of X-ray crystallography, the hydrogen bonding interactions present between the coordinate and free imidazole molecules and between the nitrido and free imidazole participate in 
 <bold>5</bold>, although the coordination geometry around the rhenium atoms in 
 <bold>5</bold> is similar to that in 
 <bold>2</bold>. The C–H···N bonds at the nitrido with PPh
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and Mim, and the O–H···N hydrogen bonding interactions at the nitrogen atom(s) of the cyanido with solvent molecules are less effective to the emission quenching because these interactions exist in the crystals of strongly luminescent
