<p id="Par19">A fluorescence detector (KETEK, AXAS-D, GmbH) was installed at about 20â€‰mm away from the sample, perpendicular to the diffraction circle to collect X-ray fluorescence data simultaneously with XRD measurement. The results were calibrated on a few selected regions of the combinatorial libraries by wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in an electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JEOL, JXA-8530f Plus). The XRF data was fed into an in-house model to correct any offset of the composition coordinates due to experimental errors.</p>
