<p id="Par6">The PLQE of 19.8% in CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) film still limits the EQE of sky-blue PeLED to be &lt;5%, considering a typical out-coupling efficiency around 20% in perovskite LEDs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. Encouragingly, we found that adding 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) film further increased PLQE to 49.7%, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. Here, the yttrium ratio is defined as the molar ratio of Y to Pb in the precursor solution. The photographs in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> clearly shows the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films with YCl
 <sub>3</sub> have much stronger PL emission than the film without YCl
 <sub>3</sub>. The maximum PLQEs of PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films with 2%, 5%, and 10% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> are 49.7%, 37.9%, and 31.2%, respectively, which are much higher than the film without YCl
 <sub>3</sub>. Adding YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film also blue shifts the PL peak (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films with 2%, 5%, and 10% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> exhibit PL peak at 485, 483, and 477 nm, respectively. The decreased PLQE in 5% and 10% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite films compared with 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite film might be caused by the formation of YCl
 <sub>3</sub> clusters, which may hinder perovskite grain growth (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Adding 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the 3D CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film also significantly increases the film PLQE from 1.1% to 8.5%, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. The photographs in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> illustrate the PL of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> film was significantly improved by YBr
 <sub>3</sub> treatment.
