<p id="Par12">Although SALON was found to be an oxonitride compound with an oxygen to nitrogen ratio of 1:1, it exhibits some of the structural motives typical for nitride compounds. This is very unusual as oxygen rich compounds usually do not exhibit the same connectivity as purely nitride based compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a cube-like coordination, similar to the one found in many nitride based red phosphors, could be realized in an oxonitride with an oxygen/nitrogen ratio as high as 1:1.</p>
