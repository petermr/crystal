<p>Here 
 <italic>I(t)</italic> is PL intensity at time 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic> is background, 
 <italic>B</italic> is constant, and 
 <italic>τ</italic> is PL lifetime. The fitting results are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Table S2</xref>. The PL lifetime values increased from 1827 μs (for 1% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>) to 2044 μs (for 50% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>) and then again decreased to 1932 μs (for 100% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>). This goes hand in hand with the emission integral data, which showed highest intensity for 50% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> doped sample. Therefore, it can be concluded that concentration quenching in this host matrix starts when Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration exceeds 50%.
