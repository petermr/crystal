 </xref> shows the fitting result of the sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>. The two-dimensional thermoluminescence curve can be fitted to break up into two thermoluminescence peaks. The low-temperature peak is located at 326 K. The corresponding trap deepness values are 0.62 and 0.70 eV. If the peak position of thermoluminescence is too low, the decay of persistent luminescence is very fast, and the time of duration is short. If the peak position of thermoluminescence is too high, the storage energy is difficult to be released in room temperature, and the persistent luminescence is weak. Thus, the thermoluminescence peak position of the better persistent luminescence material should be in the range of 320 and 393 K (about 0.65 eV).
