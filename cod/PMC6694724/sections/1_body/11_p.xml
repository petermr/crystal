<p>In summary, we present Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn as a design strategy to find ideal candidates for the realization of skyrmions and demonstrate the growth of its large single crystals. The method used to grow micro-twin-free single crystals reported in this work can be employed for many other compounds. The

 </sub> symmetry of the superstructure form of tetragonal inverse Heusler Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn is essential for stabilizing the antiskyrmions. Other Mn-rich Heusler compounds incorporating 4d and 5d transition metals and heavy main group elements are expected to uncover interesting noncollinear spin behavior, including skyrmions. Another aspect of interest is the occurrence of ferromagnetism in Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn, which we believe to originate from the Mn-vacancy ordering. The absence of such ordering in Mn
 <sub>2</sub>RhSn leads to ferrimagnetic interactions.
