<p id="Par2">Optical microscope is a standard laboratory tool for inspection of the sample geometry and its internal microstructure at 
 <italic>Î¼</italic>m to mm dimensions. Raman microscope is an instrument that allows, on the top of it, recording Raman spectra from the area selected by the focus of the objective. In this way, Raman microscopy provides a complementary, spatially resolved information about the structure and chemical composition.
