 </xref>. While three other crystal terminations (Eu, Sn single and double layer) cannot be excluded in this material without further theoretical and experimental studies, all our data indicate that the (001) crystal surfaces are indeed P-terminated: the calculations for the Eu and Sn terminations show surface states much closer to the center of the BZ. Moreover, our core level spectra (

  <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>
 </xref>) show that the P 2s levels occur at two energies, indicative of two starkly different chemical environments (thus bulk vs surface) for the P atoms. By comparing the band dispersion observed in the ARPES spectra and the DFT calculations, we conclude that the cleaved crystals are some 220 meV hole doped. This is consistent with the large
