<p>One of the defining aspects of ferroelectrics is the reorientation of polarization by means of an external electric field. However, unlike insulating ferroelectrics, switching the polarization is difficult in WTe
 <sub>2</sub> because of its high conductivity: The applied bias induces electrical current rather than acts on the polar distortion (fig. S1). Nonetheless, if the flow of large electrical currents can be prevented, e.g., by insertion of a dielectric layer between the contacts, then it is possible to apply an electric field to WTe
 <sub>2</sub> and realize ferroelectric switching. To achieve such a configuration and to preclude the possibility of direct charge injection (

 </xref>) from the tip into the WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, we prepared thin film samples in a capacitor geometry (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and see Materials and Methods for details). In these capacitor structures, current flow is inhibited by a dielectric layer at the ferroelectric/metal interface (see also section S3) (

 </xref>), as the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> sample surface briefly exposed to air before the metal deposition forms a very thin oxide layer (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> shows a metal-gated WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake on the surface of a Ti/Au-coated silicon substrate. The WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake is 15 nm thick, and the Ti/Au metal electrode on top of it is 9.5 nm thick (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, inset). In this configuration, the electrical current flow across the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is strongly suppressed (fig. S3), although the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake is still metallic (
