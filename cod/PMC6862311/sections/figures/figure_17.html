 <caption> ( a, d, g) Illustration of the three feature length scales in mesocrystals: d 1 ≈ 6.6 nm corresponds to the distance between Au nanoparticles ( a), d 3 ≈ 0.433 nm corresponds to the hexagonal superlattice of dodecanethiol ligands bound to the gold core facets at specific locations between gold atoms ( d), d 4 ≈ 0.372 nm corresponds to the distance between carbon atoms of ordered ligand chains ( g). ( b, e, h) Magnitudes of the angular Fourier components of intensity I ν ( s ) at scattering vectors s 1, s 3 and s 4 corresponding to the distances d 1, d 3 and d 4, respectively. The angular dependence of the scattered intensity is shown in the insets by black lines. ( c, f, i) Angular cross-correlation functions C(∆) measured at scattering vectors s 1 ( c), s 3 ( f), s 4 ( i) when frequency v = 2 is set to zero (red line) or when the two frequencies with v = 2 and v = 4 are set to zero (purple line) (adopted with permission from Mancini et al.
