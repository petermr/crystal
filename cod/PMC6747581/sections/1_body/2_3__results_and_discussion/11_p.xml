<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b, it is clearly seen that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits absorption peaks at 1.13 eV along the x-direction, which has to be due to the direct band gap of 1.129 eV at Z-point (from electronic band structure). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f004">Figure 4</xref>b shows a high absorption coefficient in the visible region. Absorption peaks of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> are observed at 1.129, 2.02, 2.5 and 2.7 eV along both x and z-directions. When the photon energy is about 2.7 eV along the x-direction, and 2.5 eV along the z-direction, the absorption coefficient of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> reached a maximum in the visible region. The valence band maximum is mainly attributed to the states Tl-
 <italic>s</italic>, and thallium is a very good absorbing material in the visible region. Consequently, we observed that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits high absorption in the visible region. Due to the indirect band gap of silicon, the absorption occurs for the photon energies higher than 2.5 eV as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. The difference between the indirect and direct band gap in silicon is about 1.40 eV, which results in low absorption coefficients for silicon in the visible region. Our results show that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> has better absorption coefficients compared to silicon in the visible region.
