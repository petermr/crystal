<p>Inorganic nanocrystals, due to their high mechanical, thermal and chemical stability, have garnered an immense interest from the point of view of their potential implementation in biomedical application, i.e., optical and magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, light-induced hyperthermia generation etc. [

 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Their optical properties may be in a facile way modified by the introduction of the appropriate optically active ions like lanthanide (Ln

 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to the fact that the optical properties of such nanoparticles are strongly affected by the temperature, their luminescence may be employed to non-contact temperature sensing (luminescent thermometry, LT). In LT, temperature readout relies on the analysis of thermally-affected spectroscopic parameters like emission intensity, luminescence lifetime, peak position, band shape and polarization anisotropy [
 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One of the most important advantages of LT in respect to other temperature measurement techniques is the fact that it provides a real-time temperature readout with unprecedented spatial and thermal resolution [
 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, temperature readout is provided in an electrically passive mode what enables to achieve the information about, i.e., the condition of living organisms where even small temperature fluctuations are usually accompanied by serious health diseases and improper cellular biochemical processes [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,

 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The use of the nanosized LTs enables the improvement of the spatial resolution of temperature readout. However, in order to obtain high thermal resolution of temperature measurement, different approaches, which enable to increase the relative sensitivity of LT to temperature changes, were proposed up to date. As was recently demonstrated, the utilization of transition metal ions luminescence with lanthanide co-dopant as a luminescent reference enables the enhancement of temperature sensing sensitivity, luminescence brightness and the broadening of usable temperature range in which LT operates [

 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For this purpose, optical properties of different TM were investigated, such as V

 <sup>2+</sup> [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Another advantage of using TM is the susceptibility of their optical properties to the modification of the crystal field strength via host stoichiometry due to the fact that 
 <italic>d</italic> electrons, located on the valence shell, are exposed to the local environment and crystal field changes. This phenomenon was investigated in detailed in case of temperature sensing performance of Cr
