 <caption> Identification of the lattice anisotropy of an exfoliated 1T’-WTe 2 flake. a) AFM image of the 1T’-WTe 2 flake transferred onto a Si/SiO 2 substrate by mechanical exfoliation. The heights of zone 1 and zone 2 are 16.36 nm and 5.25 nm, respectively. b) ADRDM results of the same WTe 2 flake ( Fig. 1) in polar coordinates. c) Azimuth-dependent RDM images. </caption>
