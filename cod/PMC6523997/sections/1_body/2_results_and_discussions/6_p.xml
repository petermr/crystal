<p>The stability of thin films is monitored by comparing UV–vis absorption spectra and XRD patterns of freshly made and aged films. The aged ones were measured after 14 days of storage in a Petri dish under ambient conditions of our chemical laboratory where the ambient temperature is (21.0 ± 2) °C and the relative humidity (% RH) is 40 ± 4. The pristine material starts to degrade within the first week showing a progressive color change from black (perovskite α-phase) to a complete light yellow color after 30 days (PbI
 <sub>2</sub>). This degradation is confirmed by the enhancement of the PbI
 <sub>2</sub> absorption peak in the UV–vis range (∼550 nm) and the increase of the diffraction feature related to the (001) plane of lead iodide at 12° (2θ). The XRD pattern related to the aged pristine material also shows broader peaks and the presence of new diffraction peaks due to the reduced crystallinity and less oriented crystal domains (

The degradation is not reversible, and the perovskite α-phase is not recovered after reannealing. As shown in

 </xref>a, the aged perovskite containing Zn(II) shows the same XRD pattern as the freshly made and a slight reduction in crystallinity, visible by the widening of the fwhm diffraction peak, which is presumably due to the interaction of the perovskite layer (not encapsulated) with the environmental humidity.
