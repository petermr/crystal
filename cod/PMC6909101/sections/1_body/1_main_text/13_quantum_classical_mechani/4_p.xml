<p id="p0775">Above, we described a new mechanism of electron-vibrational transitions as if the electron has free will. In fact, we are discussing the dynamic self-organization of complex molecular systems, which is presented here on the simplest example of the dynamic self-organization of electron-vibrational transitions in molecules. Similar issues are widely discussed at present in such fields of physics as quantum information and cybernetic physics (see Refs. [

In a chaotic molecular transient state, there is essentially an intense exchange of information between a very light electron and heavy nuclei about their current energies and states of motion. The consequence of this exchange of information is the regular, but not singular, dynamics of the transient state [
