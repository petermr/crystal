<p>The validity of model 
 <bold>4</bold> is further supported by analyzing data of several more crystals. In all cases, the refined occupancies were not significantly different. The composition SiB
 <sub>2.64(2)</sub> suggests the presence of 88% B
 <sub>10</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup>
 <sub>2</sub> and 12% B
 <sub>11</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup> icosahedra in the disordered α-SiB
 <sub>3–

 </sub> structure (the occurrence of B
 <sub>12</sub> or B
 <sub>9</sub>Si
 <sup>p</sup>
 <sub>3</sub> icosahedra is rather unlikely; see next section). As a reminder, 100% Si
 <sub>2</sub>B
 <sub>10</sub> and 100% SiB
 <sub>11</sub> icosahedra would correspond to the compositions SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> and SiB
 <sub>3.67</sub>, respectively.
