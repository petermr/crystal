<p>The remainder of this article is divided into three sections. The next chapter contains the discussion of the results and consists of three sub-chapters: The binding energy diagrams calculated for the azo–BTA dimers are discussed first, followed by the Hirshfeld surface analysis of the crystalline azo–BTA star phase found in the literature [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and then concluded by the quantification of the signatures of cooperative growth of the star-shape azobenzenes stacks. This section is followed by conclusions and how the results can be interpreted in the perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. Lastly, we give an overview of the models and computer simulation techniques applied in the study.
