 <caption> Ferroelectric domains resolved in WTe 2 single crystals. ( A) Schematic of the experimental setup for imaging domains in WTe 2 single crystals. ( B) High-magnification optical image of the WTe 2 single crystal sample. Inset shows optical image of a bulk WTe 2 single crystal. ( C to E) Topography (C), corresponding PFM amplitude (D), and PFM phase images (E). ( F to H) High-magnification imaging of small ferroelectric domains enclosed within the rectangle shown in (E), topography (F), corresponding PFM amplitude (G), and PFM phase images (H). ( I to K) Cross-sectional profiles of topography (I), PFM amplitude (J), and phase (K) across the dashed white line shown in (H) for respective images in (F) to (H). </caption>
