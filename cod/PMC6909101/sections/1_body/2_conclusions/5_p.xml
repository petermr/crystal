<p id="p0795">When dozy chaos is not strong enough to be simulated by applying the Franck-Condon principle, elements of dynamic self-organization manifest themselves in the chaotic dynamics of the molecular transient state. It is to this case that electronic transitions occur in polymethine dyes and their aggregates in solvents. Taking into account these elements of dynamic self-organization in theory allowed the author to quantitatively explain the optical band shapes in polymethine dyes and their aggregates (Section 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). The dynamic self-organization of the transient state is most clearly manifested in the case of J aggregates, where the elementary transfer of the alternating electron charge along the quasi-linear optical chromophore is facilitated by a quasi-synchronous motion of the environmental nuclei (Section 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). This fact manifests itself in a very narrow and intense optical J band, and in this connection J aggregates are widely used in a variety of applications (see Refs. [

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and references therein). An overview of other cases of successful applications of dozy-chaos mechanics is briefly provided in the introduction to this article (Section
