<p id="Par3">Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show considerable promise as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. One of the most intriguing types of behaviour displayed by these materials is the propensity for certain TMDCs to undergo an 
 <italic>in operando</italic> activation process during water electrolysis, leading to a gradual enhancement in electrocatalytic activity. TaS
 <sub>2</sub> and NbS
 <sub>2</sub> both exhibit such behaviour, which manifests as a gradual improvement in the essential metrics for the HER with sustained potential cycling (5000 cycles) to negative potentials

 </sup>. However, so far, these are the only TMDC materials known to show such behaviour. The search for new TMDC electrocatalysts that also undergo 
 <italic>in operando</italic> activation is therefore of fundamental interest and of critical importance for understanding the reaction mechanism of the HER and for the future development of novel electrocatalytic systems.
