<p>The atom-decomposed spontaneous polarization is given for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0, 0.5, and 1 compositions in 
 <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>
 </xref>. The major contribution toward the polarization is coming from the displacement of the O atom from its centrosymmetric position. It can be seen that the polarization contribution of Ti toward higher 
 <italic>x</italic> value decreases. In contrast, an opposite trend is seen for V atom. This is because of the enhancement of covalency between B-site cation and O with V substitution at Ti site.
