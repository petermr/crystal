 <caption> Tip movement to control the nanowire growth. a, b During the period of uniform growth, the length of nanowire increased by 96 nm while the apparent diameter (∅) remained unchanged. c, d at 57.8 s, a lateral jump of ~25 nm leftward occurred to the tip. After the jump, the nanowire showed increase in both length and ∅. e Plot of ∅ and the change of tip position in the pulling direction ( Y tip) and lateral direction ( X tip) as a function of time. Scale bars, 100 nm </caption>
