<p>Zhang et al. presented a fixed information display, where the image is defined by the pre‐aligned QR domains in the film, and the contrast can be controlled with a LC based polarization rotator (

 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref> It was demonstrated that using a VAN LCD cell driven by an array of thin film transistors, an optically addressable random information display which is able to show any image with a substantial depth of gray scale could be produced. The LC cell with QRs showed the same properties as a regular LC cell under crossed polarizers but added controllable down conversion emission from aligned QRs (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0019" ref-type="fig">19</xref>). Because of the in‐cell structure, such optically addressable devices have large potential for efficient and stable color conversion in photo‐emissive displays,[qv: 30b,59] security applications and other applications related to displays and photonics.
