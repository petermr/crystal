<p>Soft matter, which includes polymers, liquid crystals, colloidal systems, membranes, foams, and granular materials, covers a broad range of possible condensed matter structures between periodic crystals and completely disordered liquids. Usually these systems are characterized by relevant length scales above interatomic distances and weak interparticle interactions, which are typically of the order of thermal energies at room temperature [
