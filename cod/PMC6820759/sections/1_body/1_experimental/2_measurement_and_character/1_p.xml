<p id="Par6">The XRD patterns of all as-synthesized samples were measured by X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker Corporation, Germany) with Cu-Kα radiation λ = 0.15406 nm under the condition of 40 KV and 30 mA, and the range from 10° to 80°. The SEM images were identified by high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7001F). The FT-IR patterns were identified on Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Spectrum 100, Perkinelmer). The PL and PLE spectra at room temperature were recorded by fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-4600) with a excitation resource xenon lamp (400 V, 150 W), and a 400 nm cut-off filter was used. The decay curves were measured by a spectro-fluorometer (Horiba, Jobin-Yvon TBXPS). Above of measurements are under room temperature. The temperature-dependence spectra were recorded on a spectro-fluorometer (Horiba, Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 FL3-21), combined with a self-made heating attachment and a computer-controlled electric furnace (Tianjin Orient KOJI Co. Ltd, TAP-02).</p>
