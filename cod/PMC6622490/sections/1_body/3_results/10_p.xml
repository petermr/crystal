<p>From the observation to the stations recorded data sheet, it is noticed that the noise levels are higher than 70 dB at most of the day intervals except the hours from (1 am- 7 am) through night timing interval, thus the 690 transducers at the 3 stations will produce about 87-watt sec. in 18 hours (7 am- 1 am), subsequently 0.024-watt hour. As known a LED street lamp consume about 60 watts in one hour; so the produced amount of converted energy is not sufficient to run any application. Thus, the area used for the application needed to be increase to with about 2483 transducer units where each unit consists of 690 transducers to light 1 LED street lamp for only one hour.</p>
