<p id="Par9">The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were registered by using X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) (D8 Advance) operating at 50 kV and 40 mA in a step size of 0.02° in the range of 10° to 100°, and a X’Pert Pro, PANalytical code was used to do the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns with a step size of 0.01° using the same operating voltage and current. The lattice constants

 <italic>c</italic> were directly obtained from the refinement of the X-ray data using the Jade software.
