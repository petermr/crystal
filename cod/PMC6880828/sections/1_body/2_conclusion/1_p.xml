<p>In summary, a new photoresponsive supramolecular coordination complex based on overcrowded alkenes is presented, allowing switching between three different cage structures. Interestingly, the cage structures with Pd
 <sub>2</sub>L
 <sub>4</sub> constitution were shown to be homochiral, forming single diastereomers as evident from NMR, CD and X-ray analysis, supported by DFT calculations. Additionally, the cage structures were able to bind OTs
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> inside their cavity. Although photoswitching affords a large geometric change of the ligands, only minor changes were observed in binding constants of the different cage structures. These results show that by incorporation of overcrowded alkenes into SCCs the geometry of cage structures can be controlled by light. Different designs might be considered to translate these geometrical changes to changes in properties such as guest binding affinity and selectivity.
