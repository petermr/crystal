<p>It is becoming increasingly realized that within bioinformatically-defined classes of riboswitches there exists variation in both the cognate metabolite that regulates gene expression and the ability to discriminate between chemically related metabolites (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Diversity in ligand recognition within a defined class is exemplified by the 
 <italic>ykkC</italic> family of riboswitches. Originally identified as a sequence upstream of genes encoding multidrug resistance efflux pumps and other transporters (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), these riboswitches remained orphan until it was determined that some members respond to guanidine (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Further examination of this class revealed multiple distinct classes sharing a secondary structure, but containing sequence variation within some of the most conserved regions. Distinct classes of the 
 <italic>ykkC</italic> family of riboswitches have most recently been verified to bind the purine biosynthetic precursor phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the bacterial alarmone ppGpp (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and nucleoside diphosphates (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Other examples of ligand recognition diversity have been observed within class-II cobalamin riboswitches that bind adenosyl- and methylcobalamin with a spectrum of selectivities (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), a subset of GEMM-I riboswitches that bind cyclic AMP-GMP rather than cyclic di-GMP (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and rare FMN riboswitches that bind an alternative but unknown compound (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).
