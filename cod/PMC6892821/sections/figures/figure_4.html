 <caption> (top) XPS survey spectra of the Cs-K-Sb photocathodes P006 and P007. The photoemission lines for Cs 3 d, K 2 p, and Sb 3 d, which are most relevant in the chemical analysis of the samples, are highlighted. Region scan of the K 2 p peaks for P006 and P007 (top-right) from which peak positions, shifts and fittings are obtained. (bottom) Sb 3 d and O 1 s region spectrum deconvoluted by fitting peaks for O 1 s (dashed green line) and the two antimony species: (1) Sb 3− and (2) Sb (0). The measured signal with Shirley background are shown as a black line and a dashed black line respectively. </caption>
