 <p id="Par2">Spin-orbit couplings enable the electrical manipulation of spin degrees of freedom and so have a central role in spintronic devices. Here, the authors identify an unconventional spin-orbit effect in high-symmetry situations that leads to a linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space.</p>
