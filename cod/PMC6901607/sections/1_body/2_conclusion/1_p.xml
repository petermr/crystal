<p id="Par14">In summary, a series of high-quality Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-alloyed CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub> NCs are synthesized using the ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> salts. Since both the Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> precursors contain the same halide, this paves a pathway for the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> upon its introduction in the host CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> matrix. When the content of Zn

 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>X
 <sub>3,</sub> the NCs retain the identical crystal structure and morphology except for the lattice contraction and the reduced NCs dimension. The lattice contraction and the reduced unit cell dimension of the NCs resulted in an increased bandgap and blue-shifted PL emission without much reduction in the PLQYs (&gt;16% for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> and &gt;80% for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub>). Moreover, owing to their outstanding optical properties, the CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub> NCs exhibit potential for use in WLEDs as a color conversion layer. Experimentally, for the first time, the fourfold conversion layers (blue, green, yellow, and red) of CsZn
 <sub>0.15</sub>Pb
 <sub>0.85</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub> NCs are used with UV LED chips to obtain white light having superior quality that leads to a tunable color hue (2218–8335 K) with CRI maximized to 93, and high LER in the range of 268–318 lm·W
 <sup>−1</sup>. Based on these results, we expect that these NCs are feasible for obtaining next-generation white light sources with remarkable optical properties and reduced environmental toxicity.
