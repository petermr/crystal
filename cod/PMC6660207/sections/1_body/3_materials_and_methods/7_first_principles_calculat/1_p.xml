<p>Density functional theory calculations with gradient-corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (

 </xref>). The PAW pseudopotentials were used. We used a relatively large cutoff energy of 500 eV. The total energies were converged within 1 meV per atom. We used the atomic coordinates provided by Mitzi’s group (

 <italic>k</italic>-point sampling mesh of 5 × 5 × 1, we used the constant-volume algorithm to search for the lowest-energy state. Subsequently, the volume was either increased or decreased by 3% to start a new constant-volume calculation, where the volume varied between 2815.97 and 2024.01 Å
