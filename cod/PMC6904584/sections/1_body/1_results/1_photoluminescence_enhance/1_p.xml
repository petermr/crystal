<p id="Par5">We fabricated and studied perovskite films with two different compositions in this study: 3D CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film and 2D–3D mixed CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl film (molar ratio is 1:1 in precursor solution). Details about the film fabrication could be found in the Methods section. Chlorine was added in these films so that both films emit sky-blue light, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks at 486 nm for CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film and 487 nm for CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) film (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The corresponding CIE coordinates are (0.06, 0.26) and (0.08, 0.25), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Under the ultraviolet (UV) lamp, CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) film exhibits much brighter PL emission than the CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> shows PLQEs of CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film and CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) film under different incident laser intensities. Maximum PLQE of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) film (19.8%) is much higher than that of CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film (1.1%). Phenylethylammonium halide incorporation in 3D perovskites usually introduces layered phases in the films, which has been demonstrated as an effective method to increase the PLQEs of green perovskite films

 </sup>. Therefore, we focused on CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1) perovskite in this study because of its higher PLQE compared with 3D CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> film. PL spectra of perovskite films with different CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl ratios are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, which shows blue shift of PL peak from 522 nm for CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> film to 487 nm for CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:1). Further increasing PEACl ratio in the films to CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:2) results in a much lower PL intensity and very broad emission band with multiple peaks, which might be from self-trapped exciton emission of different layered phases

 <sub>3</sub>:PEACl (1:2) film in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> clearly shows more layered phases are formed with the increased PEACl ratio in the films.
