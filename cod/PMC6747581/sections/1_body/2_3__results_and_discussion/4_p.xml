<p>In order to understand the dynamical stability of the TlGaTe
 <sub>2,</sub> we carried out the phonon calculations. The calculated vibrational spectrum curves together with the corresponding site projected density of states are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The positive phonon frequencies suggest that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is dynamically stable. The phonon frequencies in the TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> have a separation between the low and high-frequency modes (the so-called phonon band gap). The vibrational modes are spread over from 0 to 1735 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. As expected, based on the relationship between masses and frequencies given by equation [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the heavier element thallium is normally connected with the lower frequencies. The lattice vibrational modes for Tl, Ga, and Te are present in the 0 to 450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> range, 1167 to 1735 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> range and 0 to 767 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> range, respectively.
