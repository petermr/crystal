<p>The few available kinetic studies indicate that the dehydrogenation reaction is ruled by the diffusion of MgH
 <sub>2</sub>, Al, or hydrogen in the TiF
 <sub>4</sub> doped samples [

 <xref rid="B208-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. In any case, the activation energy of dehydrogenation reaction (42) is high: 117.5 [
 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]–123 [
 <xref rid="B197-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>] kJ/mol. Theoretical studies indicate that Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is metastable at room temperature with a formation enthalpy of −21 kJ/mol H
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B209-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. By ab-initio calculations, Spanò et al. determined, that the dehydrogenation temperature at atmospheric pressure must be 111 °C [
 <xref rid="B210-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Thus, despite the interesting high hydrogen content and low dehydrogenation temperatures, Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> can be classified as a one-way hydrogen storage material.
