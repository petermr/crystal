<p>The hydroflux method,
 <xref rid="open201900287-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> which we employed here, is based on a highly concentrated mixture of alkali metal hydroxide (
 <italic>A</italic>OH) and water as reaction medium. Typically, the molar ratio 
 <italic>q</italic>(
 <italic>A</italic>)=
 <italic>n</italic>(
 <italic>A</italic>OH) : 
 <italic>n</italic>(H
 <sub>2</sub>O) is close to one. The properties of such a medium resemble a pure hydroxide flux, as a strong basic character and high solubility for oxidic compounds are given. Adding small amounts of water lowers successively the melting point of the alkali‐metal hydroxide (neat KOH: 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>=360 °C; KOH⋅H
 <sub>2</sub>O: 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>=143 °C). Upon adding larger quantities of water, the domain of hydrothermal conditions is reached.
