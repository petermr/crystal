 <p>We report on an emerging symmetry axis in the magnetoresistance of bulk single crystals of quasiâ€“one-dimensional Li
  <sub>0.9</sub>Mo
  <sub>6</sub>O
  <sub>17</sub> below 
  <italic>T</italic>
  <sub>min</sub> = 25 K, the temperature at which the electrical resistivity experiences a minimum. Detailed angle-dependent magnetoresistance sweeps reveal that this symmetry axis is induced by the development of a negative magnetoresistance, which is suppressed only for magnetic fields oriented along the poles of the MoO
  <sub>6</sub> octahedra that form the conducting chains. We show that this unusual negative magnetoresistance is consistent with the melting of dark excitons, composed of previously omitted orbitals within the 
  <italic>t</italic>
  <sub>2g</sub> manifold that order below 
  <italic>T</italic>
  <sub>min</sub>. The unveiled symmetry axis in directional magnetic fields not only provides evidence for the crystallization of these dark excitons but also sheds new light on the long-standing mystery of the metal-insulator transition in Li
