<p>Si substrate was first cleaned by immersing in the piranha solution (H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>:H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> = 4:1), followed by extensive rinsing with Milli-Q water. As-prepared Au@Ag SHINs solution was added by a dilute H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution to lower the pH around 3, casted on the cleaned Si substrates, and subsequently dried in air. Sn oxide SNC solution was then casted on the Au@Ag SHINâ€“modified Si substrate and dried in the Ar stream, followed by several extensive rinsing with Milli-Q water and chloroform. The former process was to remove inorganic substances, such as NaCl and B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> generated from a sodium borohydride reduction process, while the latter process was to remove organic substances such as dendrimer molecules from the interface between SHINs and substrate before each SHINER measurement.
