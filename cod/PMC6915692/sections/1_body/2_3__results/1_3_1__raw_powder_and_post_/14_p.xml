<p>Finally, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy allows us to determine the optical properties and the colorimetric coordinates of the powders in the CIE L*a*b* space (

The yellow powder has a very slight absorption rate in the near infrared part of the spectrum and a very strong UV absorption; the reflectance spectrum versus wavelength can in first the approximation be described as an abrupt Boltzmann curve, characteristic of a wide-gap semiconductor, with the gap being located at 380 nm. The slight absorption in the infrared part of the spectrum, with an absorption coefficient continuously increasing with the increase of the source radiation wavelength (decrease of the energy) can be attributed to a very low density of free carrier charges thermally activated (from Valence Band to Conduction Band) which can be described as a Drude electronic cloud [

 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-01555" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This yellow sample has a quasi-total reflection window in the visible spectrum, up to nearly 90% reflection at 500 nm; the yellow color being explained by the occurrence of the tungsten oxide gap located on the frontier between the UV range and the visible range, inducing a slight absorption of the purple hues. The argon-annealed powder (black sample) absorbs almost all of the light over the entire UV-Visible-NIR wavelength range (200â€“2000 nm). It was previously discussed how the oxygen sub-stoichiometry is then associated with the creation of free electrons causing the absorption of all the photons of the radiation energy range. The powder obtained directly after precipitation (blue sample) has interesting intermediate properties: it shows a strong absorption of the signal in both UV and the near infrared ranges, whereas a small window of reflectance in the visible range can be observed with a maximum at around 450 nm. The difference in the color of the products is due to the presence or absence of free electrons, but only from the intervalence band between localized W
 <sup>5+</sup> ions and neighboring W
 <sup>6+</sup> ions inside the bulk structure. Indeed, a small amount of W
 <sup>5+</sup> is enough to produce a strong coloration of the product from intervalence mechanism (polaron transfer between consecutive W
 <sup>5+</sup> and W
 <sup>6+</sup> ions through oxybridges).
