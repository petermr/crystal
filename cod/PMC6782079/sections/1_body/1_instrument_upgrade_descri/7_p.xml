<p>Interpolation positioning is a future option for POWGEN. This necessitates a large increase in pixilation of the instrument and subsequent incorporation into all the instrument calibration, normalization and data reduction routines, and thus it requires further development work and testing. In addition, next-generation WLSF scintillator detector modules are currently under development which incorporate three 64-sensor multi-anode photomultiplier tubes yielding 192 electronic channels for a higher spatial resolution of 3 × 10 mm. It is envisioned that once 40 new-generation detector modules are constructed, all 80 detector positions can be filled in an optimal arrangement.</p>
