<p id="p0700">The elementary transfer of electron charge in condensed media, when in theory only non-local phonons are taken into account, traditionally refers to chemical physics. In other words, in this article we have demonstrated, strictly speaking, only the fact that quantum mechanics stops to operate in chemical physics and the need to introduce chaos (dozy chaos) in the transient state of elementary electron transfers. In molecular physics, where local phonons must be taken into consideration in theory, this demonstration, as previously mentioned, has yet to be realized. However, more recently, the emergence of chaos in the problem of excitation of a hydrogen molecule under the influence of a periodic external force was theoretically proved [
