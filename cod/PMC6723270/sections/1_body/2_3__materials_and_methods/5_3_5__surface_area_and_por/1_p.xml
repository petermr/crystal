 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms were conducted to study the surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of the materials. The samples (100.0 mg) were degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 24 h, and the adsorption–desorption isotherms were taken in a MICROMERITICS equipment model ASAP 2020, (Micromeritics, Norcross (Atlanta), Georgia, GA, USA), at 77 K with a pressure range from 1 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> P/Po to 0.99 P/Po. The specific area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method for mesopores and the Hovarth–Kawazoe (HK) method for micropores were used to determine the pore size distribution. To predict the surface energy of the synthesized materials, nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) was applied.
