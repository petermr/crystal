<p>The present article focuses on nanoparticles of WO
 <sub>3</sub> obtained by polyol route. The polyol method is a robust strategy for the preparation of well-defined metal or oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in terms of size, shape, composition, and crystallinity. Typical synthesis entails the reduction of a metal precursor by polyol in the presence of an appropriate capping agent at an elevated temperature. In 1988, Figlarz et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-01555" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] developed the polyol method to synthesize metal powders, including Co, Ni, and Cu particles. The choice of the polyol type is dictated by the optimum reflux temperature and its reducing strength allowing the precipitation of well crystallized particles of metals oxide or metal particles. Hence, an optimal use of polyol process, thanks to the control of the reducing capacity of the polyol solvents, can give access to oxides having an oxygen sub-stoichiometry, i.e., favoring the lowest oxidation numbers without achieving the full reduction of the metallic elements [
