<p id="Par17">Since the η-isomer has a lower energy, one would expect an improvement in catalytic performance in a Te-deficient 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> when additional edge sites and tellurium vacancies are created, similar to the mechanism proposed for the 1T-MoS
 <sub>2</sub> analogue
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. To test this hypothesis, we synthesised and electrochemically tested a nanocrystalline MoTe
 <sub>1.8</sub> compound. This MoTe
 <sub>1.8</sub> material does indeed demonstrate an 
 <italic>in operando</italic> activation process (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25</xref>), with the overpotential required to sustain a current density of −10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> reducing from 320 to only 210 mV. The fact that this reduction in overpotential is not as marked as with the stoichiometric MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> provides useful information, as it suggests that the hydrogen adsorption occurs preferentially on the tellurium sites, i.e., despite a higher ΔE
 <sub>H</sub>, the α-isomer is more favourable for hydrogen adsorption than the η-isomer. The preference for the Te-site indicates that it is the basal plane that is catalytically more active in 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub>. In the case of the α-isomers, H adsorption leads to a change in Mo–Mo bond lengths and this may be the primary cause for the change in the experimental Tafel slopes on cycling (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">26</xref>). However, the change in bonding is minor and therefore, a rapid relaxation of the structure is expected in line with the observed experimental evidence, e.g., the overpotential reverts back to the original value when the potential bias is switched off. As suggested in the literature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>, the conventional volcano plot analysis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> does not take into account potential secondary activation processes due to lattice distortion effects. Therefore, the relatively high value of ΔE
 <sub>H</sub> for H adsorption on the α-site does not correspond to relatively high exchange current densities. Hence the computational studies suggest the distortion of the MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> structure as the primary cause of the activation process.
