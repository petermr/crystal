<p>In this paper, we describe a synthetic route to attain scattering-free films made of RE-activated NaGd(WO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, LaVO
 <sub>4</sub>, and GdVO
 <sub>4</sub> nanophosphors and perform a systematic evaluation of their performance on the basis of their QY. Then, we use the most efficient host to prepare red- and green-emitting phosphor layers based on Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> and Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> activators, which, combined in a bilayer structure, yield transparent and efficient phosphor coatings that emit white light. We optimize the thickness of the constituent layers to achieve a total extinction of the incoming photoexcitation as well as a bright white-light emission of tunable shade. The absence of light scattering in the stack provides both transparency and efficient photoexcitation of the inner layers. The shade of the emitted light from a given coating can be continuously tuned without altering the chemical composition of the emitters by means of the gradual shift of the photoexcitation wavelength, a consequence of the spectral dependence of the light penetration depth. The total extinction of the incoming radiation along with QYs above 35% make these layered phosphors one of the most efficient transparent white converter coatings ever developed. Central to this achievement is the formation of a thin (hundreds of nanometers) plane parallel packing of RE nanophosphors by wet deposition methods that was later sintered at a high temperature in a controlled way; hence, transparency was preserved all through the process. As a result, phosphor films displaying simultaneously high QY, bright-colored emission, and transparency are achieved.
