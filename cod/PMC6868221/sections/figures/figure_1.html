 <caption> Deformed microstructure and the exceptional hardness of an Al-Mg system after HPT. The upper micrographs show the cross-sections of the Al-Mg disks after HPT for 1 turn as an example of mechanical bonding 9 and 100 turns. In the center, the TEM micrographs taken at the disk center and edge prove microstructural homogeneity with grain sizes of ~35–40 nm throughout the disk material. A color-coded contour hardness map with a set of unique color keys that denote values from 180 to 360 provide the homogeneous hardness distribution with an average of 340 across the Al-Mg disk after 100 HPT turns. </caption>
