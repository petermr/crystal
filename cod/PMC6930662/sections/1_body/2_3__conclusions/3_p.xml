 <xref rid="B68-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] on the light-induced evolution of an azobenzene-containing supramolecular tubule in view of our data showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f006">Figure 6</xref>, where the defects are characterized quantitatively for the azo–BTA column. Finally, here we considered the stacks of azobenzenes in the dark, i.e., the stars in all-trans state. It would be interesting to elucidate the behavior of all-cis azo–BTA stars and the energetics of their self-assembly, since, as we showed recently, the stacks made by all-cis azobenzene stars maintain their clusters upon light stimulus, even though their shape is more disordered, as compared to the stacks in the dark.
