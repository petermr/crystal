<p>Compared with the covalent P−O bonds, the Co−O bonds show a significantly lower ED in the range of approximately 0.32 to 0.52 eÅ
 <sup>−3</sup> at the BCP. The Laplacian at the BCP is significantly more positive and ranges from 4 to 10 eÅ
 <sup>−5</sup>. The ED increase correlates with the reduction in distance. In the theoretical data set,
