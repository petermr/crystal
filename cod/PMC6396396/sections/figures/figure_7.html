 <caption> Section of the superspace model based on M40 #1 showing atomic domains relevant for Al/Si ordering. Displacive modulations are neglected here. Atomic domains that form part of the octahedra, i.e. Al1, O1 and O2, are not shown. Different background colours indicate dicluster and tricluster units. The domains of Al2, Si2 and O3 are described by more than one block wavefunction. </caption>
