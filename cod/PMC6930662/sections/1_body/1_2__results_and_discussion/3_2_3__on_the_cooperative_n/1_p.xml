<p>The noncovalent association into one-dimensional columns is the first step in the appearance of complex supramolecular structures. Discovering the factors that affect the growth from a single azo–BTA star to the stacks and columns is a step forward to understanding the multi-structured morphologies found experimentally. One of these factors is the assembly mechanism, which is determined by the dependence of the association constant for monomer addition (in our case, azo–BTA star) on the assembly size
