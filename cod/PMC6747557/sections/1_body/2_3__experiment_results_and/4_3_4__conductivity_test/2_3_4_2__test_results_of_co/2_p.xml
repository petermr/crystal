<p>According to the data in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the slope of the T1 region, i.e., the low field strength region (ohmic region), is approximately 1 and remains substantially unchanged, while the slope of the T2 region, i.e., the high field strength region (non-ohmic region), increases with density. The height gradually decreases, but the slope values are all greater than 2; the slope of the LDPE in the T3 region is close to 2, and the slopes of the remaining three clocks are close to 1.
