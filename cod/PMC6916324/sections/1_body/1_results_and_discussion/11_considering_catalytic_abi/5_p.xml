<p>Finally, we note that the above arguments were made based on the ED for the bulk crystal. To verify that the predicted adsorption of for example butan‐2‐ol onto the Co

Nevertheless, the surface structure of a real catalyst may deviate from bulk‐truncated cuts, and so based on this analysis we cannot fully exclude the presence of additional relevant active sites and surface facets. However, insofar as the catalyst surface structure resembles any of the low‐index surfaces, the (011) surface has the right structural features and ED for catalytic conversion.
