<p id="Par39">HR-EBSD measurements were performed on a Zeiss Merlin FEG SEM equipped with a Bruker eFlash detector. The Kikuchi pattern at each point is recorded at the full detector resolution. The 2D spatial variation of lattice distortions is obtained by cross-correlating the EBSD pattern collected at each point in a map with a pattern collected at a nominally strain-free reference position (chosen far away from the indent (&gt;10 μm) in the unimplanted substrate material)

 </sup>. From this the deviatoric lattice strain (~1 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup>), lattice rotation (~1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> rads) and the GND density for each point was found
