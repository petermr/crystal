<p>Cartilage canals at the distal epiphysis were detected simultaneously at the epicondyle and intercondylar fossa in fetuses with a CRL of 75 mm (OSL, 10.4 mm), which increased and attained the double-positive stage (++) of cartilage canal formation in almost all fetuses with a CRL of â‰¥87 mm. The data of the present study indicated that cartilage canal invasion occurred earlier at the proximal epiphysis than at the distal epiphysis.</p>
