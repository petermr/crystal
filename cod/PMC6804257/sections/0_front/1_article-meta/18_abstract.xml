 <p>The Cu
  <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
  <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
  <sup>3+</sup> complexes of a 14 membered macrocycle were synthesized and their antioxidant capacities were evaluated against ABTS and DPPH radicals, with the objective of collecting insights into the biomimetic role of the central metal ions. The macrocycle, abbreviated as H
  <sub>2</sub>L14, is a derivative of EDTA cyclized with 1,4-diamine, and the moderately flexible macrocyclic frame permits the formation of [ML14·H
  <sub>2</sub>O] chelates with octahedral coordination geometries common among the metal ions. The metal complexes were characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic methods, as well as thermogravimetric analysis; the octahedral coordination geometries with water coordination were optimized by DFT calculations. The antioxidant assays showed that [FeL14·H
  <sub>2</sub>O]
  <sup>+</sup> was able to scavenge synthetic radicals with moderate capacity, whereas the other metal chelates did not show significant activity. The Raman spectrum of DPPH in solution suggests that interaction was operative between the Fe
  <sup>3+</sup> chelate and the radical so as to cause scavenging capability. The nature of the central metal ions is a controlling factor for antioxidant capacity, as every metal chelate carries the same coordination geometry.
