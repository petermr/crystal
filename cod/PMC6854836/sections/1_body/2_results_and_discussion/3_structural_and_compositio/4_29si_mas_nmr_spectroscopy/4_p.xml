<p>The integrated 
 <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR signal intensities for the resonances at −64 and 11 ppm yield a icosahedral/dumbbell occupancy ratio of 0.78(4). This implies a composition Si
 <sub>2</sub>(Si
 <sub>1.56</sub>B
 <sub>10.44</sub>) = SiB
 <sub>2.93(7)</sub> [25.4(4) atom % of Si] for the bulk α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> sample. We emphasize that the compositional analysis for single crystals from the refinement diffraction data and for bulk samples from 
 <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR experiments are most accurate. Therefore, the conjecture is made that poly/microcrystalline bulk samples and single-crystal samples (obtained at higher temperatures) of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> actually have a different composition. The composition of single crystals is closer to the ideal, electron-precise, composition SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub>.
