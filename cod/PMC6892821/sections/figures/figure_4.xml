  <p>(top) XPS survey spectra of the Cs-K-Sb photocathodes P006 and P007. The photoemission lines for Cs 3
   <italic>d</italic>, K 2
   <italic>p,</italic> and Sb 3
   <italic>d</italic>, which are most relevant in the chemical analysis of the samples, are highlighted. Region scan of the K 2
   <italic>p</italic> peaks for P006 and P007 (top-right) from which peak positions, shifts and fittings are obtained. (bottom) Sb 3
   <italic>d</italic> and O 1
   <italic>s</italic> region spectrum deconvoluted by fitting peaks for O 1
   <italic>s</italic> (dashed green line) and the two antimony species: (1) Sb
   <sup>3−</sup> and (2) Sb
   <sup>(0)</sup>. The measured signal with Shirley background are shown as a black line and a dashed black line respectively.
