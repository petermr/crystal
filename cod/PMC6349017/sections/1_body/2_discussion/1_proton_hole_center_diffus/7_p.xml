<p>The PT process at ZnO(112[combining macron]0) with the highest rate is inter-adlayer-PT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>), and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref> reveals that the concatenation of such PT events can yield a “zig-zag-like” diffusion of the PHC with net movement along the polar ±[0001] direction. For each individual inter-adlayer-PT event, the barrier to transfer the PHC from the dark end to the light end (downwards in the figure) is greater than the reverse process (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). For the purpose of long-scale diffusion 
 <italic>via</italic> the Grotthuss mechanism, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, concatenated PT events, once a PHC has been transferred (for example one step downwards in the figure), there is an energy barrier associated with changing the proton transfer coordinate so that the next PT event along the same direction (as opposed to the opposite direction) can occur. For this reason, there is no perpetual energy gain from transferring the PHC along the polar direction. Instead, the amount of long-scale diffusion along both polar directions (up and down) are equivalent, since the system is in equilibrium.
