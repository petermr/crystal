Electrochemical testing of synthesized and annealed ceramics was carried out in two-electrode CR20 32 cells on a charge-discharge test bench CT-3008W-5V (Neware company, HC Tower, No. 1 Sheung Yuet Rd, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong). Metallic lithium was used as a counter electrode. Electrochemical testing of copper nanostructures was carried out in two-electrode CR20 32 cells on a charge-discharge test bench CT-3008W-5V (Neware company, HC Tower, No. 1 Sheung Yuet Rd, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong). Metallic lithium was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte solution was a mixture of 1 M LiPF6, 1 M ethylene carbonate, 1 M propylene carbonate, 0.1 M diethyl carbonate, 1 M ethyl methyl carbonate, 1 M propyl acetate (TC-E810 Tinci, Neware company, HC Tower, No. 1 Sheung Yuet Rd, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong) [
