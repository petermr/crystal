<p>The co-crystals were prepared using a slow evaporation technique. The same procedure was used for each co-crystal experiment; the only difference was in the volume of solvent and amounts of starting materials used. The general procedure involved dissolving equimolar amounts of PROG and the selected co-former in a suitable solvent and subsequently stirring at room temperature. After all compounds had been dissolved in solvent, the resulting solutions were filtered into vials and left for several days after each vial had been covered with Parafilmâ„¢. Various single crystals of the co-crystals were filtered for further screening.</p>
