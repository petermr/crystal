 <caption> Density functional theory calculations: ( a) First Brillouin zone for crystal structure of pentacene in reciprocal lattice. ( b) Distribution of charge density in the surrounding of molecules in pentacene unit cell. ( c) Calculated band structure and density of states of pentacene using periodic DFT calculations. Different high symmetry points are represented in units of (2 π/ a, 2 π/ b, 2 π/ c) along certain directions as Γ = (0, 0, 0), X = (0.5, 0, 0), M = (0.5, 0.5, 0), Y = (0, 0.5, 0) and Z = (0, 0, 0.5). Zero of energy has been set at the valence band maximum. </caption>
