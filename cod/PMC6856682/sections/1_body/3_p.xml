<p>In this context, we have recently become interested in the use of phosphinines as ligands in late 3d transition metal chemistry.
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Previous work has shown that these compounds exhibit a rich coordination chemistry, and are capable of displaying diverse coordination modes.

 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Furthermore, we have shown that Cp*Fe complexes of the simple phosphinine TPP (TPP=2,4,6‐triphenylphosphinine) show considerable non‐innocent behaviour, with the TPP ligand capable of displaying either nucleophilic or electrophilic character towards external reagents.
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> We anticipated that the coordination chemistry (and, hence, onward reactivity) of these complexes might be further diversified through incorporation of the phosphinine moiety into a chelating ligand scaffold. We therefore decided to target the synthesis of an analogue of our previously reported complex [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe(η
 <sup>4</sup>‐TPP)],
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> in which TPP is replaced by the known ligand 2‐(2′‐pyridyl)‐4,6‐diphenylphosphinine (
