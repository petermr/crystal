<p>Above room temperature, an electronic transition, i.e., metal–insulator transition, occurs in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>; this has been more consistently observed compared to above the magnetic transitions. The metal–insulator transition is found at 330–350 K, with a structural change from orthorhombic (space group 
 <italic>Pmma</italic>) to another orthorhombic structure (space group 
 <italic>Pmmm</italic>).

 </sup> Furthermore, the vacancy order–disorder transition is measured at 776 K, leading to the transition from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal structure (space group 
 <italic>P</italic>4/
 <italic>mmm</italic>), resulting from the rearrangement of oxygen vacancies.
