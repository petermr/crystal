<p id="p0155">The TGA curves were measured under nitrogen atmosphere for all the samples. Since the samples were sintered at much higher temperatures no structural changes were expected to occur in the course of the TGA measurement. The experimental curves are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 10</xref> together with the first and second derivatives to facilitate the analysis. By the shape of the curves, the samples are divided into pairs of NCN0.10 and NCN1.00 showing the featureless curves with a modest overall weight loss of 0.5% and the other two with a distinct profile and a more noticeable final weight loss of 2.3% for NCN0.25 and of 1.1% for NCN0.55. Regarding the rigidity of the former pair we may presume that low amount of adsorbate (e.g. water molecules and hydroxide ions) is merely due to tightly packed dense grains of the samples. We also note here, that the samples are single compounds (Ca
 <sub>2</sub>Nb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> as NCN1.00), or almost like them (NCN0.10).
