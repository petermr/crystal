<p>The key of establishing a reliable dynamic mathematical model to describe acceleration- induced effects of pressure sensor is the accurate experimental data. As a common excitation device, a Machete hammer is able to generate a half-sinusoidal acceleration signal with a near millisecond pulse width, which reliably guarantees the transient of the pressure signals [
 <xref rid="B19-sensors-19-01052" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An experimental system for acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensor based on a Machete hammer is designed in this paper. The Machete hammer is composed of hammer, anvil, semicircle round, and counter weight, among others. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01052-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows the principle diagram of a Machete hammer. A half-sinusoidal acceleration signal is produced when the hammer hits the anvil. The indicator on the semicircle round shows the magnitude of the acceleration. Apparently, the higher the hammer rises, the larger the acceleration amplitude will be. By adjusting the thickness of the felt between the hammer and the anvil, the pulse width of the acceleration signal can be changed.
