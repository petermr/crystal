<p>Finally, no EPR signal was detected for the powder annealed under air (yellow sample). This confirms that the monoclinic phase obtained after high temperature post-treatment under air exhibits a chemical composition very close to the perfect stoichiometric tungsten trioxide WO
 <sub>3.0</sub>. A post-annealing treatment under air produces the complete filling of the oxygen deficiencies leading to the stoichiometric WO
 <sub>3</sub> product (yellow sample).
