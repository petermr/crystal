<p>To date, QDs have been heavily explored for LCDs with enhanced optical performances. In this respect, QD Vision, Inc. has compared the color performance and power efficiency for two LCDs equipped with white LED backlight and QD backlights, as shown in

The area within the CIE color triangle for the LCD display with a QD backlight is larger than the 100% of the NTSC in 1931 color space.[qv: 2a,56a] Furthermore, they claimed that the PL bandwidth should be smaller than 30 nm for a wider color gamut and better optical efficiency. In addition to the saturated color, the QD‐based backlight also offers better optical efficiency; it was estimated that QD equipped LCDs can save at least 20% more power than conventional alternatives.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref> QD Vision has also proposed a new standard called “Color Nits” for measuring brightness and luminance in the latest high‐performance displays that support high dynamic range and wide color gamut. The “Color Nits” metric is derived from a formula that takes into account varying spectral profiles and the subtle differences between perceived brightness and actual luminance. This concept integrated some aspects of the so‐called Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect, which states that more saturated colors can appear brighter than less saturated ones of equivalent luminance, meaning that wider color gamut results in higher perceived brightness levels.
