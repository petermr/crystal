 <p>Passivation of magnesium metal anode is one of the critical challenges for the development of magnesium batteries. Here we investigated the passivation process of an intermetallic anode: Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> synthesized by solid-state and thin film process. The Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> composite electrode shows excellent reversibility in magnesium bis(trifluoromethansulfonylamide) dissolved in acetonitrile, while Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Sb
  <sub>2</sub>, which has same crystal structure and similar chemical properties, is electrochemically inactive. We also fabricated the Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> thin film electrodes, which show reversibility with low overpotential not only in the acetonitrile solution but also glyme-based solutions. Surface layer corresponding to the decomposed TFSA anion is slightly suppressed in the case of the Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> thin film electrode, compared with Mg metal. Comparative study of hydrolysis process of the Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Sb
  <sub>2</sub> suggests that the both intermetallic anodes are not completely passivated. The bond valence sum mapping of the Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> indicates that the fast Mg
  <sup>2+</sup> diffusion pathway between 2
  <italic>d</italic> tetrahedral sites is formed. The electrochemical properties of the Mg
  <sub>3</sub>Bi
  <sub>2</sub> anode is mainly due to the less passivation surface with the fast Mg
  <sup>2+</sup> diffusion pathways.
