<p>Appropriate thin film deposition technology is of great significance for obtaining high‚Äêquality optoelectronic devices. Two common methods are spin coating and chemical vapor deposition. For obtaining perovskite thin films by spin coating, organic halide AX and bivalent metal halide BX
 <sub>2</sub> (PbI
 <sub>2</sub>, PbBr
 <sub>2</sub>, or PbCl
 <sub>2</sub>) are dissolved in organic solvents to form precursor solutions, which are then spin casted or dropped onto different matrices and annealed to form perovskite thin films. It is very important to choose the appropriate processing time and temperature based on different precursor compositions for the needed crystallinity, phase state, and morphology of perovskite films.
