<p>Among the Li-Al LDHs, LiAl-Cl-
 <italic>m</italic>H
 <sub>2</sub>O is the only compound in which a delithiation occurs [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02667" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the mechanism of this delithiation (~570 K), after the dehydration (~400 K), and the structural evolution of LiAl-Cl at higher temperatures has not been determined. In particular, the consequence of the delithiation has not been studied, which, however, is rather interesting since the rise of the diffusion rate of the Li
 <sup>+</sup> may be due to the increase of the number of vacant Li sites in the structure. A high migrant rate of Li
 <sup>+</sup> and a relatively stable structure is the prerequisite condition of an Li-ion battery material. In this paper, we applied the first principle calculations based on DFT to study the electronic structure and bonding of LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl. Besides, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to investigate the structural evolution at higher temperatures. The diffusion of the Li from the cation layer into the inter-layer space and the resulting high Li mobility followed by a further delithiation from the system were further investigated.
