 <caption> Performance of as-fabricated white LED devices. Emission spectra of the white LED devices fabricated with the commercial yellow phosphor YAG:Ce, the commercial red phosphor KSF:Mn 4+ and a without or b with the cyan phosphor NKLSO:8%Eu 2+ on a blue LED InGaN chip ( λ = 455 nm) under a current of 20 mA. The insets show photographs of the fabricated white LEDs. c Experimental spectra of the white LED without the sample ( x = 0), white LED with the sample ( x = 1) and theoretical spectrum x = 0.9. d The R a index plot per x for different theoretical spectra, THEOR(λ) = LED1(λ) +  x × DIFF(λ) with a maximum at x = 0.9 and theoretical maximum R a (theoretical max) = 95.7 </caption>
