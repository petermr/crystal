<p id="Par11">The regular patterns observed in the computed core level shifts offer promising perspectives to monitor peak energies in XPS spectra of multi-alkali antimonide photochathodes grown for bERLinPro. Here, we consider this possibility retroactively for photocathodes P006 and P007 grown and characterised at HZB
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. These samples are grown on a Mo substrate (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) using an alkali codeposition technique recently developed for bERLinPro and described in details in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. The stoichiometric characterisation of the photocathodes is performed 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> using XPS, which is a well established surface analysis technique that is used to determine the chemical composition of surfaces and thin films
 <sup>

 </sup>. The advantages of XPS as a diagnostic technique in the context of bERLinPro are its non-destructive nature and the possibility that it gives in the employed setup to characterise the materials without exposing them to the atmosphere (more details are provided in the Experimental Section below). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> XPS spectra corresponding to the final stage of Cs-K-Sb growth are presented. Spectra from survey measurements of P006 and P007 (top panel) show the elemental composition of the photocathode materials. Peaks associated to specific core states are clearly visible, with those referring to Cs 3
 <italic>d</italic>, Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic>, and K 2
 <italic>p</italic> highlighted as the most prominent and identifiable features in the spectrum. The stoichiometry of the samples  is determined from the relative peak intensities of the aforementioned peaks, as reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. More detailed region scans, such as the one shown for  K 2
 <italic>p</italic> (see inset of the top panel in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) offer additional insight in determining peak positions and shifts, and are also useful for peak fittings. The K 2
 <italic>p</italic> peak positions in the spectra of P006 and P007 are very similar. The sizable shifts predicted by theory are actually not observed in the top panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, which is not surprising, considering that photocathode samples are non-stoichiometric (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and they may contain amorphous or polycrystalline regions with different stoichiometry.
