 <italic>h</italic>ν = 3.830 keV; all patterns shown were measured at low sample temperature (
 <italic>T</italic> ≃ 30 K). Each of the sixfold rings represents one BZ; we see one in the center, a first ring with six and a second ring with 12 adjacent BZs, making up 19 BZs observed in parallel. Accumulation time was ∼15 min at a total count rate of ∼10
 <sup>6</sup> counts s
 <sup>−1</sup>. A slight image-field curvature (due to the large field of view) and Lorentzian deformation due to a weak but significant space-charge shift was visible. The Coulomb interaction of a photoelectron with the charge cloud of slow secondary electrons leads to an anisotropic acceleration of the photoelectrons with a Lorentzian profile. This deformation of the energy distribution in 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>kin</sub> versus 
 <italic>k</italic> representation can be very strong in the soft X-ray range [with shifts up to 10 eV (Schönhense 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <italic>b</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb62"> ▸</xref>)]. In the hard-X-ray range the effect is an order of magnitude weaker, probably due to the lower cross section and high speed of the photoelectrons, leaving the cloud of low-energy (true) secondary electrons very rapidly. The deformation can be corrected using the algorithms described by Schönhense 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2018
 <italic>b</italic>
