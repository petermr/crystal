<p>Herein, we present a study of such phases prepared from Ta
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub> and binary nitrides A
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> (A: Mg, Ca) instead of the alkaline earth amides as reactants, and determination of the crystal structure for the calcium compound. The feasibility of Ca and Mg ion extraction from CaTaN

 </sub>Ta
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> was studied both chemically and electrochemically. Finally, in light of the results achieved, the feasibility of Ca deintercalation form CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> is also investigated using first principles calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) approximation.
