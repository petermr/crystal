<p>At ZnO(112[combining macron]0), the proton hole center diffusion network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref>) is in several ways different to what is the case at ZnO(101[combining macron]0). Firstly, PHC(O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup>) does not constitute a “dead end”, since there are two possible next locations of the PHC, corresponding to intra-surface-PT and inter-surface-PT events, respectively. Consequently, PHC(O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup>) can contribute to Grotthuss-like diffusion of the PHC. Moreover, the black dotted lines indicate the O*H
 <sup>–</sup> movement from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>. However, vehicular O*H
 <sup>–</sup> movement does not contribute to any long-scale diffusion of the PHC, since the bridging O*H
 <sup>–</sup> species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>) are very inactive for PT (ESI Fig. 4
