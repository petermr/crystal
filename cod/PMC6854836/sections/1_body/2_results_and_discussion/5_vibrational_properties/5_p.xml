<p>The Raman spectrum of B
 <sub>6</sub>P can be easily related to α-B
 <sub>12</sub>. The phonon states of B
 <sub>6</sub>P have been recently calculated, and its Raman spectrum was analyzed.
 <sup>

 </sup> There are five A
 <sub>1g</sub> and seven E
 <sub>g</sub> modes. The A
 <sub>1g</sub> + E
 <sub>g</sub> pair associated with changes of the 3c bonds (equatorial breathing and bending) in α-B
 <sub>12</sub> will blue-shift upon exchange of the 3c-bond for exo-bonds to P atoms. At the same time, the modes associated with stretching of B
 <sup>p</sup>–B
 <sup>p</sup> exo-bonds will red-shift because of their substantially increased length compared to α-B
 <sub>12</sub> (cf. 
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>
 </xref>). As a consequence, all modes associated with stretching of exo-bonds (i.e., both B
 <sup>p</sup>–B
 <sup>p</sup> and B
 <sup>e</sup>–P) fall in a narrow range 1000–1100 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. The removal of 3c-bonds (through the introduction of the P
 <sub>2</sub> units) leads also to more individual (localized) skeleton modes, which fall in the range 630–830 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. Skeleton modes are red-shifted with respect to α-B
 <sub>12</sub> because of the “enlarged” icosahedra in B
 <sub>6</sub>P. The location of the B
 <sub>12</sub> libration mode is essentially maintained. Lower-frequency modes are then associated with the P
 <sub>2</sub> dumbbells. The A
 <sub>g</sub> mode at 479 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> corresponds to the P–P stretching mode. The E
 <sub>g</sub> mode at 373 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> corresponds to a P–B bending mode arising from a rotational movement/displacement of the P
 <sub>2</sub> entity.
