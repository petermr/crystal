 <caption> Sequence of photoelectron diffraction patterns of the rhenium 4 f 7/2 core-level signal ( E B = 40.5 eV) at selected photon energies between 2.8 and 6 keV, corresponding to the final-state energies given in panels ( a)–( f) ( E final = hν − E B + ). The patterns have been symmetrized; the contrast has been optimized in order to emphasize fine features. Dashed lines denote the principal Kikuchi bands (width = 4.552 Å −1) originating from Bragg reflection at lattice planes perpendicular to the surface. In ( b) the sixfold symmetry of the bands is indicated. White circles mark identical crossing points of dark Kikuchi lines, providing a convenient ‘ruler’ in k-space. ( g, h) Model of the h.c.p. lattice of Re. Lattice planes with distance cause the Kikuchi bands ( g); planes with distance d 0001 cause constructive diffraction in the forward direction normal to the surface ( h). </caption>
