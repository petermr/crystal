<p id="Par9">Strain localisation through formation of such slip channels during inhomogeneous plastic deformation has been observed in several past studies on irradiated metals, such as copper

 </sup> etc. Indeed, the prediction of the slip channel formation was made by Cottrell
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> even before its first observation in TEM. The earliest experimental observations of dislocation channelling were made by Makin and Sharp, in neutron irradiated single crystals of copper and copper alloys
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, based on which they also proposed a mathematical model for slip line and pile-up formation in irradiated metals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Their model is based on a hypothesis similar to ours, whereby irradiation-induced defect clusters are destroyed by gliding dislocations. Similar ideas considering removal of irradiation defects have also been considered in several other studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. The objective of this study is to explore this hypothesis for the case of helium-implanted tungsten, using a combination of modelling and experimental techniques. A model built on this hypothesis will capture the physics of the internal damage mechanism. In the long term, such models could be useful for predicting the lifetime of engineering components, or to conduct virtual experiments.
