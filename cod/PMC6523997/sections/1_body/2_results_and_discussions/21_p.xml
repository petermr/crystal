As shown, the resulting film is highly oriented along the (100) and (200) plane and 6.3027 Å as the lattice parameter which implies a contraction of the unit cell. In terms of stability, the material containing only 3-CPACl is stable after 60 days of exposure at ambient conditions, but it is only with a combination of the two additives that better results are achieved.
