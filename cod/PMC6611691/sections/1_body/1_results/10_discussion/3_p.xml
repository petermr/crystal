<p>The fact that 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub> does not diverge at θ = θ
 <sub>CR</sub> is attributed within this picture to the slight canting of the MoO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra within the unit cell ϕ
 <sub>cant</sub> ~ 6°, as illustrated in fig. S8 (and section S3), which ensures that there is always a residual component of the 
 <italic>B</italic>-field that is orthogonal to the quantization axis and, thus, the condition for perfect alignment is never satisfied. When the magnetic field is rotated within the 
 <italic>ab</italic> or 
 <italic>bc</italic> plane, the angle between the 
 <italic>B</italic>-field and the quantization axis is always maximized when 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>b</italic>, and so is the negative MR (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>). In addition, 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>c</italic> have a higher positive MR than 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>b</italic> due to the enhanced Lorentz force as well as a propensity for field-induced one-dimensionalization whenever the 
 <italic>B</italic>-field is perpendicular to the atomic chains (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>36</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, one expects the maxima (minima) to be located at 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>a</italic> or 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>c</italic> (
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>b</italic>), and no asymmetry in the ADMR is expected in these rotation planes (see section S5).
