 <caption> Dependence of the temperature width of the Sm-A and Hex-B coexistence region on the LC film thickness. The solid line shows the result of fitting with the analytical equation Δ T ∝ ( 1 − L 0 / L ) 2 , where L 0 ≈ 0.9 μm is the characteristic length scale (adopted from Zaluzhnyy et al. [ 70]).
