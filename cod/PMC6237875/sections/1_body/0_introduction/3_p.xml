<p id="Par5">Here, we apply single-crystal X-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells (see Methods) in order to study SiO
 <sub>2</sub> phases, which appear on compression of coesite, and their high-pressure behavior. Several independent experiments are performed at different synchrotron radiation facilities at pressures over 70 GPa. The results are summarized in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. We show that high-pressure phases of coesite can be used as proxies of the local structure of high-pressure silica melts. The crystal structure of coesite’s high-pressure phases can also give an insight into the mechanisms of silica glass densification.
