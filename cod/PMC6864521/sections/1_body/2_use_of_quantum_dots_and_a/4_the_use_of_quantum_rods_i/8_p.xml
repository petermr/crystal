<p>Aubert et al. synthesized aligned, silica coated CdSe/CdS QRs in polymer nanofibers by electrospinning.[qv: 30b] The uniaxial extensional flow experienced by the particles induced alignment of the QRs within the nanofibers. A subsequent parallel alignment of the nanofibers themselves resulted in a flexible film of 1.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, with a DOP of 0.45. It has been shown that such a self‚Äêsupporting film can induce the alignment of a nematic LC. By integrating them into a LC cell with a polarizer, the simple liquid crystal device constitutes an efficient way of electrically switching on and off polarized light by 5.0 volts and fully preserving the polarization ratio over a large area (
