<p>All DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09, revision D.01, software package.

 </sup> Geometry optimizations were performed using the B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr) functional, the relativistic Stuttgart–Dresden (SDD) pseudopotential and basis set on Ga and In and the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set on all other atoms. The structures were optimized without any symmetry restraints. Frequency analyses at the same level were performed on all calculations to verify that the obtained stationary points are in fact energy minima. Thermochemical analysis was performed using a temperature of 298.15 K. Depicted visualizations of the geometry-optimized structures were prepared using the VESTA software program.
