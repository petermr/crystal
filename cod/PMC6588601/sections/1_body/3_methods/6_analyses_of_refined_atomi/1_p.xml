<p id="Par34">The 3D local cation-order metric used here to describe a distribution of Mg and Nb over the octahedral sites was defined by adopting an approach proposed in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup> to characterize the Mg/Nb ordering from atomic-resolution STEM images of PMN. In this work, the order metric has been equated with the coefficient of variation of intensities for the Mg/Nb columns surrounding a Pb column. For a disordered case, all the Mg/Nb columns have similar average atomic numbers/intensities, and the coefficient of variation is zero. In contrast, strong ordering yields large values of this metric. In this case, we defined the ordering metric, 
 <italic>η</italic>, as 
 <italic>η</italic> = (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> − 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sup>2</sup> + (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>4</sub> − 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sup>2</sup>, where 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> is the fraction of, say, Nb atoms found in the 
 <italic>i</italic>
 <sup>th</sup> coordination shell around a given B-cation (Nb or Mg) normalized to the fraction expected for this shell from the average concentration of Nb. The metric was calculated for each B-cation in the configuration. With this definition, clusters of the B-cations with large values of 
 <italic>η</italic> represent chemically ordered regions.
