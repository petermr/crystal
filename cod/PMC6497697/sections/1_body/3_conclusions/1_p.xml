<p>We have studied 19 types of nanoclusters and some relevant magic formulas for the number of atoms, bonds, coordination numbers, and topological indices. These include the fcc, bcc, hcp, the Platonic solids, diamond cubic, simple cubic, and decahedral clusters. The majority of these results are more detailed than previously determined, and a large number are enumerated for the first time. A grand goal of materials-related research is the correlation of structure with properties. This detailed study of the magical relationships for nanoclusters is a step in that direction. An example is the discussion of the dispersion of surface atoms and its relationship to catalytic activity. It is our intention that these results will aid scientists in their studies of nanocluster structure and the associated properties.</p>
