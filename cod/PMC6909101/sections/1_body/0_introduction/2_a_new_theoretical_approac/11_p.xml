<p id="p0055">Among these important results, a special place is occupied by a theoretical explanation of the nature of the well-known narrow J band (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), which is determined by the dynamic pumping of an electronic transition in the chromophore of J aggregates (a tetramer with a brickwork-type structure) with weakly chaotic, or in other words, highly organized motion of nuclei in the environment (the case of weak dozy chaos) [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The role of exciton effects in the shaping of the J band is insignificant. Conversely, the nature of the narrow H* band (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) is elucidated by the existence of dozy-chaos dynamics as well as a reasonably great exciton dynamics, their strong interference interaction [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A competitive interference of the chaotic dynamics of nuclear reorganization and exciton dynamics in the chromophore of the H * aggregate, which is the dimer (H * dimer), leads to a “pumping chaos” from the peak of the optical band of the H * dimer into its wing, making the peak even narrower and the wing still wider. This effect is associated with an abnormally strong exciton interaction in the H* dimer, which is a consequence of the specific structure of the H* monomers that make up it.
