<p>We aim to build a database of COFs structures reported from the literature and with refined geometry. In the following, we will refer to these structures as 
 <italic>CURATED</italic> COFs, an acronym that stands for 
 <italic>Clean, Uniform, and Refined with Automatic Tracking from Experimental Database</italic>. The database includes one set of CURATED COF structures that contains the original frameworks as reported in the literature, with uniform orientations of the layers and minor corrections in the case of typos, chemical errors, or solvent removal (“
 <italic>CURATED from literature</italic>”, 324 COFs), and another set containing the structures that succeeded the DFT optimization (“
 <italic>CURATED DFT-optimized</italic>”, 308 COFs). The whole design of the CURATED COFs repository was conceived to easily correct for possible errors and to be upgraded with more recently reported frameworks.
