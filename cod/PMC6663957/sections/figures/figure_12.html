 <caption> Images of the image quality phantom simulated inside the Scanner B reconstructed using OSEM algorithm with six subsets and 24 subiterations. Transverse planes through the part with the cold rods: a cylindrical geometry without normalization, b block geometry without normalization, e cylindrical geometry with normalization, and f block geometry with normalization. Transverse planes through the part with the hot rods: c cylindrical geometry without normalization, d block geometry without normalization, g cylindrical geometry with normalization, and h block geometry with normalization. The images are transverse planes through the part containing hot rods. The color bar in each row is common </caption>
