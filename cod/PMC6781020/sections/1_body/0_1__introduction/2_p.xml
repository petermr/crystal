<p>Therefore, it is urgent to develop a technique that is of high response, low limit of detection, simplicity in operation and capability of in situ detection. There are a few of techniques to detect heavy metal ions, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) [
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) [
 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The quantum dot (QD) method, with grain size less than 5 nm, has fluorescence effects, which could be used in the detection of drugs [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], anions [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and organic pollutants [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It also has prospects in the detection of heavy metal ions by using its characteristics of fluorescence.
