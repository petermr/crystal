<p>The resulting virtual bi-crystal resembled closely our experimental specimens, to the exception of the relative position of the boundary within the virtual specimen and the specimen’s size. These are the results of a compromise. Specifically, we moved the boundary along the specimen’s main axis. Thereby it entered the tip closer to the initial apex to facilitate earlier detection on the detector compared a setup that would have simulated the entire specimen. Such setup of 48.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ions would have caused an impractical long and computational costly simulation. In fact, even for parallelized execution and assuming an optimistic evaporation rates (300 atoms per minute [
