<p id="Par15">A phase with a crystal structure disobeying Pauling’s rules is expected to be metastable. Ab initio simulations (see Methods) confirm that both coesite-IV and coesite-V are dynamically stable at the pressures where they were observed experimentally (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). At lower pressure, coesite-IV is more stable than coesite-V (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, inset), in agreement with the experiment. Calculated equations of state (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) and lattice parameters (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>) of the two phases are in very good agreement with experimental data as well. With increasing pressure, coesite-IV becomes less stable thermodynamically and dynamically, to the extent that it transforms into coesite-V phase at pressures above ~50 GPa without a barrier (Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At the same time, both phases are energetically highly unfavorable—at 38 GPa, where coesite-V and coesite-IV are nearly degenerate in enthalpy in our theoretical calculations, the calculated enthalpy difference between them and the ground state is 0.389 eV·ion
