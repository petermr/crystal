<p>The emission spectra of Bi
 <sub>1âˆ’x</sub>OCl:xPr
 <sup>3+</sup> (x = 0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) with different doping concentrations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01296-f002">Figure 2</xref>b. With different Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentrations, the emission spectra were similar with each other. The emission peaks were at the same position, but their intensities were different. The inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01296-f002">Figure 2</xref>b illustrates the dependence of emission intensity on Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. With the increase of Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration, the emission intensity increased at first, reached the maximum when the doping concentration of Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> ion was at x = 0.0075, then decreased with further increasing Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. This phenomenon resulted from the concentration quenching effect. It is worth mentioning that the optimized doping concentration x = 0.0075 is actually a very low concentration, which means that the BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor could emit light efficiently with fewer activators. This has also been seldom seen before, which could markedly reduce the cost of phosphors for w-LEDs.
