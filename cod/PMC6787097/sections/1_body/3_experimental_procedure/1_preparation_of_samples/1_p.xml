 <sup>3+</sup> (x% is the mass percentage, x = (3, 5, 7, 9, 11) were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state method. Natural sodium feldspar and TbF
 <sub>3</sub> (99.9%) were well ground in an agate mortar and then shifted to an alumina crucible. After being sintered at 1150 °C for 3 h. All mixtures were collected after natural cooling to room temperature, and pulverized for further measurements.
