<p>DC magnetization data were measured from 2 to 300 K using a Quantum Design Dynacool Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS), equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) option. The magnetic susceptibility was defined as M/H, where the applied field was 500 Oe. Field-dependent magnetization data were collected at 2 K with magnetic field up to μ

 <italic>H</italic> = 9 T. The electronic transport measurements were carried out in a PPMS-9 cryostat using the four-terminal method between 1.8 and 300 K under magnetic fields up to μ

 <italic>H</italic> = 9 T. Platinum wires were attached to the samples by silver epoxy to ensure ohmic contact. The normal resistivity, ρ

  <italic>xx</italic>
 </sub>, was measured in the basal plane of a single crystal, simply determined by dividing the observed voltage difference by the applied current, suitably normalized by the sample dimensions. The Hall resistance, ρ

  <italic>yx</italic>
 </sub>, was similarly determined by applying the magnetic field perpendicular to a single crystal basal plane and measuring the voltage within the plane perpendicular to the direction of the applied current (again suitably normalized by the sample size).
