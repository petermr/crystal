<p id="Par19">To unravel this extensive debate, we used a combination of temperature constraints on single augite crystals and numerical simulations to demonstrate that Theo’s Flow has been formed by multiple magma emplacements at different times. We can therefore summarize this new hypothesis for the thermal history of Theo’s Flow as follows: in the Archean age, the erupted differentiated lavas flowed at very high temperatures in a turbulent regime

 </sup>. Because of their low viscosity, these lavas flowed for considerable distances until they were trapped by topography. The first emplacements, almost coeval, were those of the peridotite and pyroxenite in a subaerial or subaqueous environment and then the gabbro flow mechanically-eroded
