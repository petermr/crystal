 </sup> The optimized atomic positions (PBE-TS optimized structures) were used in all subsequent intermolecular interaction energy calculations. The model energies were calculated between all unique nearest neighbor molecular pairs. The model (termed CE-B3LYP) uses B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) molecular wave functions calculated by applying the molecular geometries extracted from the crystal structures. This approach employs electron densities of unperturbed monomers to obtain four separate energy components: electrostatic (

 <sub>E</sub>), polarization (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>P</sub>), dispersion (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>D</sub>), and exchange-repulsion (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>). Each energy term is scaled independently to fit a large training set of B3LYP-D2/6-31G(d,p) counterpoise-corrected energies from both organic and inorganic crystals.
