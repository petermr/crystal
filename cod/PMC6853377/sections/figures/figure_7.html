 <caption> Core-level spectra and corresponding ( k x , k y )-distributions of Re 4 f ( a, b), 5 s ( c, d), 4 d ( e, f), 4 p 3/2 ( g, h) and 3 d 5/2 ( i, j), recorded at hν = 3.500 keV. ( k, l) Group of L 3 MM Auger lines excited by higher-order radiation, falling into the same time window as the Re 4 d signal. Note that the binding energy scale in ( k) refers to the 4 d signal (at hν = 3.750 keV); the Auger lines originate from third-order radiation ( hν = 11.250 keV). The blue bars denote the spectral ranges used for extracting the core-level diffractograms. </caption>
