  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup> had shown that the electrical conductivity and behavior of all the oxide EGs can be strongly suppressed by annealing in oxygen, because annealing will remove oxygen vacancies in both the STO substrates and the films. Most previously reported EGs cannot survive an annealing in oxygen at 300 °C or even much lower

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref> shows that the CHO/STO can remain metallic over the whole temperature range (or above 100 K) after an in situ annealing at a temperature of 500 °C (or 600 °C), under partial pressure

 <sub>3</sub>/T-STO. Furthermore, we found that even after a 24-h annealing at 1000 °C, under 
 <italic>P</italic>(O

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). Note that our control experiments showed that even LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub>/T-STO became highly insulating after the same extreme annealing (see Supplementary Fig.
