<p>After synthesis, the particles were washed and dried in an oven (80 °C), then heat-treated at 600 °C under different atmospheres ranging from air (oxygen partial pressure equal to 0.2 bar) to argon (about 10
 <sup>−5</sup> for the oxygen partial pressure) and oxygen partial pressures of 10
 <sup>−2</sup>, 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 10
 <sup>−4</sup> bar obtained by mixing argon and air gas flows.
