 <p id="Par1">The single-crystal SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub> (001) has two different surface terminations, TiO
  <sub>2</sub> and SrO. One most remarkable observation in previous studies is that only the heterointerfaces with TiO
  <sub>2</sub>-terminated SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub>, which usually combines with polar oxides such as LaAlO
  <sub>3</sub>, host an electron gas. Here we show that a robust electron gas can be generated between a non-polar oxide, CaHfO
  <sub>3</sub>, and SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub> (001) with either termination. Unlike the well-known electron gas of LaAlO
  <sub>3</sub>/SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub>, the present one of CaHfO
  <sub>3</sub>/SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub> essentially has no critical thickness of CaHfO
  <sub>3</sub>, can survive a long-time oxygen annealing at high temperature, and its transport properties are stable under exposure to water and other polar solvents. By electrostatic gating through CaHfO
  <sub>3</sub>, field-effect devices are demonstrated using CaHfO
  <sub>3</sub>/SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub> heterointerfaces with both terminations. These results show that the electron gas reported in the present study is unique and promising for applications in oxide electronics.
