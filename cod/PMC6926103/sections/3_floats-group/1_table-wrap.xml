       <p id="p0025">The phase diagram needs to be reassessed and the experimental data are scarce since high reactivity of lithium at elevated temperature with the air contained elements (O
        <sub>2</sub>, N
        <sub>2</sub>, H
        <sub>2</sub>O) and the high energy effects accompanying the respective reactions makes it very difficult to obtain good quality results, therefore, the calculated data provides new insights for samples preparation and experimental planification
