<p>In conclusion, we have identified a new high-pressure phase in the guanidinium metal formate perovskites 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> that is isostructural with the ambient-pressure structure of 
 <bold>CdGF</bold>. Our experimental and modelling data demonstrate that the host–guest hydrogen bonding between guanidinium and formate ions plays a crucial role in determining which phase is the more stable: the rhombohedral structure is able to accommodate both small (
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> under pressure) and large (
 <bold>CdGF</bold>) unit cells, while the orthorhombic structure provides a snug fit for 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> at ambient pressure but cannot easily distort to accommodate the larger Cd ion. Host–guest hydrogen-bonding interactions also strongly influence distortion within each phase, with the linear compressibility being notably smaller in directions where the guanidinium ions are able to resist compression by acting as ‘struts’ within the framework.
