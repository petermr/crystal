<p>The interaction of water with ZnO surfaces has been the subject of numerous theoretical studies, for water coverages ranging from sub-monolayer (sub-ML),
 <xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> to one
 <xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and a few MLs,
 <xref rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> to the liquid.
 <xref rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In general, it has been found that an increase of the water coverage leads to a greater degree of water dissociation at the surface. Water molecules adsorbed on surface Zn ions (Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup>), here denoted O*H
 <sub>2</sub>, can dissociate and recombine by transferring a proton to/from a nearby surface oxide ion (O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup>):
 <disp-formula id="eqn1">
  <label>1</label>O
  <sub>s</sub>H
  <sup>–</sup> + O*H
  <sup>–</sup> ⇌ O
  <sub>s</sub>
  <sup>2–</sup> + O*H
  <sub>2</sub>
 </disp-formula>where we have arbitrarily chosen to have the forward reaction correspond to water recombination, and the backward reaction correspond to water dissociation. Above, we consider the proton adsorbed on the oxide ion to form a “surface hydroxide ion” (O
 <sub>s</sub>H
 <sup>–</sup>). In a previous work,
 <xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we called the above reaction “surface-PT”, because of the participation of the surface oxide ion. At ZnO(101[combining macron]0), numerous studies
 <xref rid="cit32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> have indicated that PT can also happen between an adsorbed hydroxide ion (O*H
 <sup>–</sup>) and an adsorbed water molecule (“adlayer-PT”):
 <disp-formula id="eqn2">
  <label>2</label>O*H
  <sub>2</sub> + O*H
  <sup>–</sup> ⇌ O*H
  <sup>–</sup> + O*H
