  <p>3D characterization of tomographic visualization of the Cu

   </sub>S bifrustum NCs after reaction with GaCl
   <sub>3</sub> at 30 °C for (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. After 15 min, only a small dimple is present at the surface of the NCs. After longer reaction times, these cavities are found to be larger. Red arrows indicate hollow NCs without an apparent opening at the surface. (d–f) Orthoslices used to reconstruct the 3D morphologies presented in (a–c). Animated (rotating) versions of the models depicted in panels (a–c) are provided.
