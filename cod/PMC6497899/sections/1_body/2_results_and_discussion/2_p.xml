<p id="Par37">Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs were prepared according to an established process with minor modification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, the Abs peak at around 400 nm is observed, which is assigned to exciton Abs of CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub>. Under UV light (365 nm), the QD solution shows a bright orange emission (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, inset). Two peaks are observed in the PL emission spectrum, which center at 405 nm and 595 nm, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The peak at 405 nm is assigned to the CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> host, while the broad emission band with the FWHM at about 80 nm is assigned to Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> d-d emission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The QY of our product is reaching to 52%, which is comparable with other reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The PLE spectrum of Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> has been measured (detected at 595 nm) and shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. The PLE spectrum of Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> closely follows the Abs spectrum, which demonstrates that the strong PL peak of the Mn emission originates from the exciton of perovskite. The as-prepared QDs show excellent stability, which can preserve their emission properties under ambient atmospheres for at least 3 months (25 °C, relative humidity 35–50%).
