 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows HRTEM micrographs of several individual nanoparticles identified as carbon quantum dots (CDots). We further diluted the stock solution for the HRTEM analysis in order to obtain the crystal structure of individual CDots avoiding possible agglomerations. As a consequence, the prepared TEM grid had a very low particle density and we could not obtain any statistical data on the particle size from the low-resolution TEM micrographs. The nanoparticles are mainly of between ≈4 nm and ≈10 nm in diameter, with an occasional presence of nanoparticles as large as 30 nm. The TEM micrograph presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> is the magnified image of the red squared region shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> reveals that the cluster of about 40 nm in size, which is seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, is formed by at least seven sub-10 nm nanocrystals. It is convenient to present 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing values for the identification of these nanoparticles instead of power spectra, which show diffraction spots generated by only one plane. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows the HRTEM micrograph of a ≈10 nm diameter nanoparticle. This nanoparticle is identified as being composed of a graphite phase based on the observation of the 0.34 nm lattice spacing values, corresponding to the (002) plane interlayer distance of the graphitic carbon phase (
 <italic>P</italic>6
 <sub>3</sub>
 <italic>mc</italic> space group) with lattice parameters of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 0.246 nm and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.671 nm. The lattice spacing value of 0.24 nm is obtained by overlapping two (002) planes as described in the literature [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some other studies identified this lattice spacing as the {1120} lattice plane of graphene [
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It should be noted here that when it comes to CDots, it is common to assign them as graphene rather than graphite, since typically, stacking of a few layers of graphene forms the CDots. The HRTEM micrographs obtained from a ≈9 nm nanoparticle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and a ≈11 nm nanoparticle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) reveal the same lattice spacing of 0.24 nm for both nanoparticles. The HRTEM micrograph obtained from an elongated nanoparticle with a volume of 4 × 9 nm
 <sup>2</sup> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, revealing the presence of 0.34 nm lattice fringes corresponding to the (002) plane. Further information on the characterization of the CDots together with an extended discussion of the XPS results (Figure S1), the results of the FTIR study (Figure S2a) and absorption and PL spectra (Figure S2b) can be found in
