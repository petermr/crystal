 </sup>. All-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) calculations, in the framework of local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) studies, of Cu(410) also show a sequence of contractions that continue from the first to the fourth interlayer spacing, i.e., (−; −; −; −)

 </sup>. The discrepancies in the theoretical and experimental results have been attributed to LEED analyses done/limited to only three or four layers from the surface, and do not portray the overall relaxation scenario as depicted by theoretical calculations
