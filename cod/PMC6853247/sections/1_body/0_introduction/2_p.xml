<p>The sequence of phase transformations of the major rock‐forming minerals with increasing temperature and pressure in the Earth's mantle is relatively well understood. The most abundant mineral in the upper mantle, olivine, transforms to wadsleyite at 410 km (approximately 14 GPa; Katsura et al.,

 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). The second most abundant mineral, orthopyroxene, undergoes gradual transformation (completed in the pressure interval 14‐16 GPa) to majorite garnet through the reaction with pyrope garnet (e.g., Irifune,

 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). Then ringwoodite and majorite react to form a mixture of bridgmanite and ferropericlase (at approximately 23‐24 GPa; Hirose, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Through these phase transformations, the minerals change to denser crystal structures. These changes are sometimes associated with a change in the coordination of oxygen ions surrounding a cation, in particular silicon (Finger &amp; Hazen,
