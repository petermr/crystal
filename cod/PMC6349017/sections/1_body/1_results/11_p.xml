<p>Unlike what was the case at ZnO(101[combining macron]0) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>), the LHS and RHS of the two adlayer-PT coordinates at ZnO(112[combining macron]0) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>) are not equivalent. This is because the direction of adlayer-PT at ZnO(112[combining macron]0) has a component along the polar [0001] direction of the crystal substrate. The PT barriers for the relatively rare intra-adlayer-PT coordinate depend very strongly on whether the proton is transferred along [0001] or [0001[combining macron]], while for the more common inter-adlayer-PT coordinate, the direction of PT has less of an influence (amounting to only about 0.2
