<p>Although software packages specializing in SAXS [
 <italic>e.g.</italic>
 <italic>DPDAK</italic> (Benecke

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> ▸</xref>) and 
 <italic>GIXSGUI</italic> (Jiang, 2015
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> ▸</xref>)] can typically be used for GIXD data visualization and reduction, analysis of diffraction data requires other features typically not available in SAXS software, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> calculation of expected peak positions and intensities from a known crystal structure, support for detectors mounted on goniometer arms, and subsequent data stitching or, in the case of textured samples, the extraction of pole figures.
