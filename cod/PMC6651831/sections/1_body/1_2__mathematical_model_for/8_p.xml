<p>In the next step, experimentally measured material properties are implemented into the derived equations. Previous studies [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have shown that high-performance transverse thermoelectric composites usually consist of one semiconducting thermoelectric phase and one highly conductive phase, where the thermoelectric phase provides high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity, the conducting phase provides low electrical resistivity. Therefore, we chose anisotropic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> polycrystal as the matrix phase and Copper as the fibrous phase for the composite. The properties of these materials are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. According to 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the Copper phase was isotropic and Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> was anisotropic with planar (uâ€“v plane) isotropy.
