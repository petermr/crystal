<p>In contrast to the monovalent cation chloride salts, in the CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> experiments there is a significant shift of the band close to 1090 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> in the FTIR spectra to lower and higher wavenumbers, respectively (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a). Similarly, the more dominant FTIR bands in the 1400 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> region are different in relative intensity and position for the precipitates from solutions containing Ca and Mg in comparison to those produced in experiments with NaCl or KCl. Bands in this region correspond to the carbonate asymmetric stretch,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
 </sup> indicating that in the Ca- and Mg-bearing solutions, different carbonate phases were formed. A broad area with multiple IR bands close to 1500 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is consistent with the formation of calcite in the CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions, whereas the presence of three distinct bands at around 1500 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> and particularly the sharp IR band close to 3600 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, indicates that the phase precipitated in the MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> experiments is a hydrated Mg-carbonate. The production of a different phase is confirmed in the SEM images (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b,c), where two distinct crystal morphologies can be observed in the CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution experiments and only platy crystals are observed with both concentrations of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>. In the experiments with the higher CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (equivalent to 1 M ionic strength), the crystals showed a high degree of porosity and appear to be an assembly of many smaller particles (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b). Between these porous crystals, 5–10 μm long crystals with well-defined crystal faces and a more rhombohedral morphology were also observed. EDX spectroscopy of the crystals showed that both contained Ca, consistent with the identification of calcite using μm-resolved Raman spectroscopy of the precipitated crystals with different morphologies. Lowering the CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> concentration produced very similar crystal morphologies to those observed in the KCl and NaCl experiment, as well as flat crystals with a 3–6-fold rotational symmetry (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b). EDX spectroscopic analysis of the flat crystal showed that they contained Ca and were later identified as calcite based on their Raman spectrum. In contrast, the prismatic crystals were identified as zabuyelite. The Raman spectra for the platy crystals from the MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> experiments showed bands of the hydrated Mg-carbonate phase dypingite (Mg
 <sub>5</sub>(CO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>·5(H
 <sub>2</sub>O))

 </sup> (not shown). Analysis of the Raman spectra show that the FWHM of the carbonate symmetrical stretch from zabuyelite increased to 9.5 ± 0.3 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> when Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> was present in the solution. PHREEQC simulations predict the formation of calcite and magnesite in the experiments.
