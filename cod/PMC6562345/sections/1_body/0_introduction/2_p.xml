<p>The hybrid perovskites are a family of materials analogous in structure to the inorganic perovskites. In both the inorganic and hybrid materials, ‘
 <bold>B</bold>-site’ cations are linked by anions into a cubic network, with ‘
 <bold>A</bold>-site’ cations occupying the cubic interstices. In the hybrid materials, however, a relatively large linker anion such as iodide, cyanide or formate expands the network compared to the inorganic analogues, allowing the interstitial 
 <bold>A</bold> site to be occupied by a polyatomic organic ion such as an alkylammonium, guanidinium, formamidinium, acetamidinium or imidazolium. Like their inorganic analogues, the hybrid materials exhibit both a great diversity of potential compositions, with hundreds of these materials reported over the past decade [
