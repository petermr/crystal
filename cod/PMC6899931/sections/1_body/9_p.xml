<p>In order to study this finding in more detail, the contributions of electrons in certain energy regions below the Fermi level were investigated by partial ELI‐D (pELI‐D).

 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> b). Further local maxima are found on the bond lines between Mg and Si2 and Si3, revealing multi‐center Mg–Si interactions within the large cavity of the framework. Finally, large values are also observed within cavity A. Although the pELI‐D values are insufficiently high to form a local maximum, they still suggest a polar—or a lone‐pair‐like—interaction. Both silicon atoms Si2 and Si3 acting within the small cavities have larger negative charges than Si1, which does not interact in the voids. The calculated pELI‐D for the next energy window between −1.56 eV and −0.62 eV (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> c) reveals mainly contributions to Mg−Si1 and Si−Si bonding, characteristic for cage (clathrate‐like) compounds.
