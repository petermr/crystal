 </sup> In this work, the interfacial structure between NaCl crystal and saturated NaCl solution has been studied by molecular dynamics method. Our study has focused on the hydration structure of ions, especially on how the crystal surface affects both ions distribution and hydration structure and how the distribution of ions and ionic hydration structure interplay with each other. We find that there are many fine structures at the interface. The distribution of water molecules in the ionic hydration structure around the interface is strongly modified by the local environment of ions.
