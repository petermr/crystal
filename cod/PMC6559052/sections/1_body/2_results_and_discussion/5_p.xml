 </xref> depicts the local adsorption geometry of atom O(1′), indicating values for the bond angle and distance from best-fit structural parameters derived from SXRD. A Ti–O(1′) bond distance of 1.93 ± 0.02 Å is obtained in the current study, which agrees well with the DFT-calculated bond length at the PBE level of theory (1.87 Å) and the Ti–OH bond length (1.95 ± 0.03 Å) found in a recent investigation of the interface formed between anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (101) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O

 </sup> PBE DFT calculations suggest a length of 2.24 Å for the Ti–H
 <sub>2</sub>O bond. This suggests that the contact layer consists of OH only rather than a mixed dissociated/molecular overlayer.
