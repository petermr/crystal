<p>Energetic materials (EMs), including pyrotechnics, propellants, and explosives, are widely applied for civil, industrial, and military purposes.

 </sup> With the progress and development of the society, the requirements for EMs increase, such as high energy density, thermal stability, thermal and shock, storability, and low handling hazards.

 </sup> Because of a delicate balance between high energy and high safety, a great challenge is to search a new balance point for EMs using chemical synthesis and crystal engineering technology. Among EMs, 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) and 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) are always considered to be representatives at the balance point.

 </sup> Besides TATB and FOX-7, 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) are a highly promising candidate. Compared with main traditional EMs like 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), LLM-105 possesses outstanding thermal stability and insensitivity to friction, spark, impact, and shock.
