<p>Our working hypothesis is that azo–BTA stars gather together cooperatively and that this growth in binding strength is due to electronic effects. According to literature data, these effects are manifested primarily based on pairwise electrostatic interactions, including long-range dipole-dipole interaction, non-pairwise short-range polarization, and resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding, and caused by the redistribution of the electron density along the column. As descriptors of cooperativity, the following features are analyzed as functions of 
 <italic>N</italic> or depending on the position of the star in the stack: binding energies, the length of hydrogen bonds, and macrodipoles. These descriptors have been used by many researchers for the classification of the self-assembly mechanisms in BTA-containing systems [
