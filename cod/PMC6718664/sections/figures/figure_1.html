 <caption> Structural characterizations of hydrated and partially dehydrated Na-birs. Rietveld-refined XRD pattern of a hydrated Na-bir and b partially dehydrated Na-bir. c Raman spectra of hydrated Na-bir and partially dehydrated Na-bir. TEM images of hydrated Na-bir: d low magnification bright field image (scale bar = 500 nm); e, f high-resolution bright field image (scale bar = 5 nm), and g fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern. TEM images of partially dehydrated Na-bir: h low magnification bright field image (scale bar = 500 nm); i, j high-resolution bright field image (scale bar = 5 nm); k, l FFT of the regions enclosed in the red and yellow rectangles in i, and m, n their respective inverse FFT </caption>
