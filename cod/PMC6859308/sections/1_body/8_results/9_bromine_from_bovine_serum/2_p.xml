<p>Inspection of the Fe map and the Br map in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> shows clearly that Br tends to accumulate on hemozoin crystals, both for parasites 1 and 2. There is also some lower Br signal in the parasites but outside their hemozoin clusters. This signal may arise from the drug BrQ as well as from Br in the serum. In order to distinguish between these 2 sources of Br, we analyze Br distribution in BrQ-treated and the BrQ-free parasites.
