<p id="Par13">Since the dependence is hyperbolic, we can assume that the product Φ =

  <italic>max</italic>

 <italic>τ</italic> is constant for a fixed density. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the density dependence of the function Φ. The data are grouped by the HE type, the initial grain size and the initial density and grain size. The largest scatter is observed for HMX with the maximum grain size which produces larger degree of inhomogeneity and leads to larger relative deviation of the value of Φ.
