<p id="Par24">Having demonstrated the realization of the Weyl state and Fermi surface arcs in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> experimentally and theoretically, we would like to emphasize that further studies of this material are called for. It is not clear which precise magnetism results in time-reversal symmetry breaking, whether it is a bulk or only surface effect

 </sup>, and how to handle it theoretically. Our calculations demonstrate that canted antiferromagnetism is one of the possible solutions, but the exact configuration of spins is to be found. The chirality of Dirac electrons has already been discussed in related material with Sr instead of Yb (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>) and experimentally confirmed in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>). Due to extremely difficult ARPES experiments (low photoemission signal) and very high resolution needed to resolve the arcs, the use of spin-resolved modification of the technique is nearly blocked, meaning that direct observation of the chirality of the Weyl points is probably postponed until the further improvement of resolution of spin-resolved ARPES. However, the presence of the time-reversal symmetry breaking as seen by magnetization and magneto-optical microscopy, the existence of a continuous Fermi surface, a two-fold degenerate crossings at the Fermi level, and Fermi arc surface states that connect these crossings across the surface BZ are direct evidence of a TRS breaking induced Weyl state in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> strongly supported by the band-structure and semi-infinite-slab calculations of the canted antiferromagnetic state; future work would be helpful in elucidating the exact mechanism of creating this state in this material.
