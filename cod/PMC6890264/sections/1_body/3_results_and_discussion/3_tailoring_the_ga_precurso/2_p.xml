<p>The observation that the reactivity of the GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP Lewis acid–base adduct complex as a cation exchange precursor is much lower than that of the InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP complex is surprising, considering that the metal–phosphorus bond in GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP should be weaker than that in InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP as Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> is a harder Lewis acid than In
 <sup>3+</sup> (η = 17 and 13 eV, respectively),

 </sup> The most frequently used parameter to quantify the steric properties of phosphines is the Tolman cone angle, defined as the apex angle of a cylindrical cone with origin 2.28 Å from the center of the phosphorus atom, whose sides just touch the Van der Waals surfaces of the outermost atoms of the organic substituents.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
 </sup> The three phosphine ligands used in the present work have significantly different electronic properties and total molecular volume, but their Tolman cone angles are essentially the same: 128° for both DPP and TPP and 132° for TOP.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
 </sup> The value for TOP is taken to be the same as that reported by Tolman for other tertiary alkylphosphines, such as tri-
 <italic>n</italic>-butylphosphine, although a recent work has estimated it to be 128°.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
 </sup> Steric effects are thus not expected to play a significant role in the cation exchange reactions investigated in our work. The electronic properties of phosphines are determined by their σ-donor ability and π-acceptor strength as they bind to metals by a combination of σ-donation from the lone pair of the P atom and π-back bonding from the d orbitals of the metal into their empty P–R σ* molecular orbital (R = organic substituent).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
 </sup> More electronegative (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., electron-withdrawing) substituents on the phosphorus atom decrease the basicity and σ-donating ability of the phosphine, while increasing its π-acceptor strength.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>−
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> This effect is due to the decrease of the electronic density on the phosphorus atom and increase of the s-character of the lone electron pair.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
 </sup> An increase in electronegativity of the substituents on the phosphorus atom should lead to weaker bonding to the metal, as should be the case for GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP compared to GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP.
