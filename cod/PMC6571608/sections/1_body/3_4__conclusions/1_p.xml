<p>In this paper we developed an analytical model for the HDS formation in PSLC and PDLC, which takes into account an arbitrary polarization state of recording beams. The forms of spatial profiles of perturbations of the dielectric tensor are numerically investigated. It is shown that the main contribution to the perturbation of the dielectric tensor of a material when only the polarization mechanism is taken into account is made by even spatial harmonics of changes in the dielectric permittivity (in particular, the second one).</p>
