<p id="Par32">The logic of our method is described in the main text (steps 0–4 in the beginning of “Results” section) and the corresponding algorithms (algorithms 1–4) are given in the Supplementary Information. The physico-chemical reasons for the selected parameters used in the prediction algorithm are discussed in the Supplementary Note
