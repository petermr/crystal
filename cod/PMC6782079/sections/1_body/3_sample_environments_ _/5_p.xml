<p>The upgrade allows access to a large 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing range (0.135–8.2 Å, for example) in a single frame. This is quite convenient as it eliminates the need for collecting time-consuming multiple frames. The wide 2Θ coverage also enables development of additional equipment to complement what is available at other diffractometers at the facility, such as a gas pressure cell, a 5 T magnet to make it feasible to study materials under a magnetic field and other equipment that is dictated by the needs of the user community.
