  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Model of the 2D non-Hermitian systems (infinitely long in the z direction) composed of cylindrical rods embedded vertically in water. Rods labeled L and G represent the loss and gain regions respectively. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Plane schematic diagram of a 2 × 1 super cell in the structure. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Band structure of 2D Hermitian PCs for a rectangular lattice with 
   <italic>α</italic> = 0. The first Brillouin zone of the rectangular lattice is indicated in the inset. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Real part of the band structure in the non-Hermitian system for a rectangular lattice with 
   <italic>α</italic> = 0.25.
