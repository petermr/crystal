<p id="Par17">Preparation of the 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell and setting on the five-terminal folder was conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox and transferred to the 3DnanoESCA station using a transfer vessel without air exposure. Two terminals of the holder were used for the ceramics heater, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>. For removing water in the dry polymer of the 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell, the cell was heated to approximately 55 °C in the high vacuum chamber of the 3DnanoESCA station. After that, heating was conducted during measurement to increase the ionic conductivity of both the solid-state electrolytes of LLZ and dry polymer.
