<p>The total and partial phonon density of states (pDOS) of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> and of the most stable configurations of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> (as derived from the CE method) were obtained at the level of the harmonic approximation using the finite-displacement method, as implemented in the PHONOPY package for phonon calculations.

 </sup> Force constants were calculated within 2 × 2 × 2 orthorhombic (triclinic) primitive unit cells using the Parlinski–Li–Kawazoe method with an atomic displacement of 0.01 Å.

 </sup> To ensure the convergence of the phonon calculations, the supercells of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> were fully relaxed so that the total forces acting on each atom within the supercells were less than 10
