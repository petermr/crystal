 <sub>2</sub> single crystals, using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS); the C(T) results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Each EuFe
 <sub>2</sub>As
 <sub>2</sub> crystal exhibits two transitions: an ordering of the Fe lattice at higher temperature, followed by lower temperature ordering (≈20 K) due to Eu moments. The EuFe

 <sub>N</sub> = 175 K. The specific heat result of ‘crystal a’ looks similar to that reported in a pressed polycrystalline sample (with respect to peak width, height, and transition temperature)
