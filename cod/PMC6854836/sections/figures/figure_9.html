 <caption> (a) Structural fragment of α-SiB 3– x , model 4, as determined by SC-XRD; Si and B atoms are shown in red and green, respectively. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level. Coordination polyhedra are drawn transparent and nontransparent and connect only to B p,B atoms at the disordered site. (b) Projection of the exo-bond (dashed orange line) onto the plane defined by arrows in (a). Note that the dashed black lines and dashed atoms are out of plane. </caption>
