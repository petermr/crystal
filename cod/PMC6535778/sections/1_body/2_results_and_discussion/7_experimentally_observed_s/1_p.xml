  <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, reveal the energies of the occupied electronic bands around the center Γ of the (001) surface projection of the bulk BZ. The outer (meaning the band with 
 <italic>k</italic> vector furthest from the center of the surface BZ) band, designated as σ, disperses linearly at about −0.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> m/s away from the Fermi level (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub>) and appears as a sharp, intense spectral feature at all incident photon energies. This is in contrast with all of the other observed electronic bands and reflects the fact that this is a surface state. Due to the nonconservation of perpendicular-to-plane momenta of the ARPES method, a range of perpendicular momenta is observed in the ARPES spectra of the bulk bands, making them appear as filled-in regions in ARPES maps, distinct from the surface band where the absence of perpendicular dispersion results in a sharp feature. The most notable bulk band is the heart-shaped band, labeled as γ, in the center of the surface BZ, which disperses upward in energy starting from Gamma to about 80 meV below 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub> and turning again down. The broad bright feature showing little dispersion in the range of energies between −1 and −2 eV (below 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub>) is from the localized Eu f states.
