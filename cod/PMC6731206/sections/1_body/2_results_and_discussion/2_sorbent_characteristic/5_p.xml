<p id="p0130">The quantitative analysis by the Rietveld method has shown that the zeolite tuff of the Yagodninsky deposit consists of 88% of clinoptilolite-Na, clinoptilolite-Ca and mordenite. Mordenite has an orthorhombic structure, while clinoptilolite-Na and clinoptilolite-Ca have a monoclinic structure. Other phases are represented by anorthite, albite, cristobalite, while the share of secondary phases accounts for about 12%. Biotite and muscovite are determined in the form of single inclusions. A diffractogram of the pattern of initial zeolite tuff and quantitative ratio of the main phases calculated by the Rietveld method is presented in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The parameters of the crystal lattice of the main zeolite tuff minerals and minerals treated with heavy metal solutions are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.
