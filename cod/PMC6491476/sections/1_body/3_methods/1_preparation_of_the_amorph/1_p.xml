<p id="Par14">Alloys of Al-9.7% Sm were prepared in ingots of 10 grams by simultaneously arc-melting the pure components (99.99 wt% Al and 99.9 wt% Sm) under an Ar atmosphere. The alloy ingots were re-melted under 1/3 atm argon and rapidly solidified into ribbons (0.02–0.03 mm thick) by free-jet melt-spinning onto a rotating Cu wheel (tangential speed of 30 m/s). Both high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) reveal the amorphous nature without any detectable crystallized phase (not shown here).</p>
