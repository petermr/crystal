 <p>Research on materials with perovskite crystal symmetry for photonics applications represent a rapidly growing area of the photonics development due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Among them are high charge carrier mobility, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and high extinction coefficients, which can be tuned through all visible range by a controllable change in chemical composition. To date, most of such materials contain lead atoms, which is one of the obstacles for their large-scale implementation. This disadvantage can be overcome via the substitution of lead with less toxic chemical elements, such as Sn, Bi, Yb, etc., and their mixtures. Herein, we summarized the scientific works from 2016 related to the lead-free perovskite materials with stress on the lasing and lighting applications. The synthetic approaches, chemical composition, and morphology of materials, together with the optimal device configurations depending on the material parameters are summarized with a focus on future challenges.</p>
