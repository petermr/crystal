<p>Full-field core-level XPD patterns at very high angular resolution of ∼0.035° are recorded within minutes. These small-angle diffractograms (polar angular range 0–11° at 6 keV) uncover a new appearance of XPD. The short photoelectron wavelength (more than an order of magnitude smaller than the nearest-neighbor distance) leads to small Bragg angles of few degrees for reflection at the lattice planes perpendicular to the surface. The small wavelength ‘amplifies’ the sensitivity of the interference pattern and is the key factor for the richness in details. Kikuchi bands can be identified in the XPD patterns and provide a
