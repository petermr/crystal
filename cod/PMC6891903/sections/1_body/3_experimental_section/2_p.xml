 <italic>Fabrication of TIEL Material</italic>: The EL ZnS: Cu was purchased from Ke Yan Company. TPU film was purchased and had a thickness of 100 µm. Acrylic substrates with a size of 10 × 5 × 0.6 cm
 <sup>3</sup> were prepared by laser cutting. The ZnS:Cu particles were mixed with PDMS at a ratio of 1:5 to form a homogenized paste, which was then coated on the acrylic substrate. The coated substrate was dried at 80 °C for 3 h, after which the PDMS layer was peeled off from the substrate. Two identical layers of TPU were pasted on the front and back of the as‐prepared ZnS:Cu+PDMS film before being sliced.
