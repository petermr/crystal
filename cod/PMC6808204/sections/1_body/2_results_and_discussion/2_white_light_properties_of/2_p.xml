<p>Using solely the PVP/N-CDot composites as color conversion layers, we have improved the CRI and the CCT values by adjusting the amount of N-CDots. The LER adopts a distinct maximum at a particular amount of N-CDots and then is reduced when the N-CDot amount increases further. In contrast, the luminous flux decays exponentially upon increasing the amount of N-CDots from 15 to 50 µL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the probed configuration contains only blue light from the LED chip and green light from the N-CDots, whereas white light is actually composed of three main colors, red–green–blue (RGB). Hence, although intended to be a WLED, this configuration has a red deficiency. Therefore, to generate white light at a high luminous flux while keeping the high CRI and LER values and a low CCT, one can integrate red phosphors of high quantum yield into the composite, especially at the low N-CDot amount. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> presents the PL spectrum of the drop-cast composite films (on the glass slide) containing different amounts of both the N-CDots and the red phosphors in the PVP matrix. The details of the sample composition are given in Table S1, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>. The amount of red phosphor that was integrated into the system was kept at 5 mg for all samples except for CDR 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). For CDR 1, CDR 2 and CDR 4, upon variation of the N-CDot amount, we observed a behavior of the PL intensity comparable to that seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. Sample CDR 3 obviously reveals the effect of the red phosphor. In the former case, the total PL intensity of the produced light decreases as the N-CDot amount is increased (at fixed amount of red phosphor). This behavior possibly results from aggregation-induced luminescence quenching and enhanced scattering of the light within the composites. In the case of the sample CDR 3, adding more red phosphor at the fixed N-CDots amount leads to a dramatic increase of the emission of the red phosphor, which is located at 610 nm, and a simultaneous decrease of the blue light emission. At the same time, the green emission of the N-CDots is also reduced, because it may be partially absorbed by the red phosphor whose absorption range covers both the blue and the green range. The optical properties of the generated white light are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. The highest CRI of 86 is obtained for the sample CDR 1, while CDR 2 and CDR 3, having lower shares of N-CDots, showed the lowest CRI of 74 and 73, respectively. At the highest amount of N-CDots (CDR 4), the CRI reaches 83. Meanwhile, all samples but CDR 2 provided good CCT values, which are 4900 K, 4000 K and 6000 K for CDR 1, CDR 3 and CDR 4, respectively. These values indicate that almost warm white-light properties are achieved. The highest LER value of 228 lm/W is observed for CDR 1, while CDR 3 and CDR 4 yield 223 lm/W and 212 lm/W, respectively. However, CDR 2 provides the lowest LER of 199 lm/W. Finally, the luminous flux of the white light generated by these samples reaches 63.5 lm for CDR 2, which is the highest, and 61.2 for CDR 3. These samples contain the lowest amounts of N-CDots, such that higher luminous flux values are indeed expected. On the other hand, as the N-CDot amount increases, the luminous flux is reduced. It is reduced to 46 lm for CDR 1 and to 41.9 lm for CDR 4. The CIE color coordinates of these color conversion layers are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. Only CDR 2 shows a deviation towards the blue from the complete white region at the center (0.33, 0.34). The remaining samples are very close to the white region, especially CDR 1 and CDR 4, which have coordinates of (0.35, 0.36) and (0.32, 0.34), respectively. Therefore, the light generated using these samples can, in principle, be considered as a good approach to produce white light.
