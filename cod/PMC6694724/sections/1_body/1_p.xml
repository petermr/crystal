 </sup> Heusler compound, Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn, wherein all the design principles mentioned above are ideally applied. Taking the example of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn, the main goal of this work is to demonstrate how the chemical and structural tuning in a material be carried out to come up with potential candidates for skyrmions/antiskyrmions. The structure of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn originates from the inverse Heusler compounds, and therefore, it does not contain any center of inversion. The large spin–orbit coupling associated with the heavy elements Pt and Sn in this compound further enhances the DMI and magnetocrystalline anisotropy effects. A high

 <sub>C</sub> of ∼400 K in tetragonally distorted Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn indicates its strong exchange interaction. The tetragonal structure of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn is similar to many Mn-rich Heusler compounds, where Jahn–Teller-like distortion and spin–orbit coupling play important roles. Interestingly, the tetragonal structure of inverse Heusler compounds exhibits a special

 </sub> symmetry, which provides all the structural ingredients to realize another vortex-like spin texture, known as an antiskyrmion, which is topologically related to the skyrmions.
