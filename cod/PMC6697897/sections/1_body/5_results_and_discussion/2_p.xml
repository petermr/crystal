<p>The MH-IV phase has an orthorhombic crystal cell based on an ice I
 <italic>h</italic> skeleton with the same stoichiometry as MH-III, i.e., a 2:1 D
 <sub>2</sub>O:CH
 <sub>4</sub> ratio. This indicates that the MH-III

  </math>
 </inline-formula> MH-IV transition can happen at constant chemical potential, without need of providing or removing atoms. The space group of MH-IV is Pmcn (n°62) where oxygen and carbon atoms occupy 4c Wyckoff sites (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). MH-IV contains ordered methane molecules and differs from MH-III where both ice network and methane ordering are concerned. The water network of MH-IV is much closer to ice I
 <italic>h</italic> than that of the MH-III phase, which is substantiated by a quantitative estimate of the topological distance (i.e., relying on the reduced coordinates) between the oxygen atoms of those 2 hydrate phases and ice I
 <italic>h</italic>. Indeed in MH-III there are 4-, 6-, and 8-fold water rings while in MH-IV the H-bonded water network is composed of corrugated (
