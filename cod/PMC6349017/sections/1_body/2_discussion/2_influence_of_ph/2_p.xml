<p>It is also possible for the surface to affect the pH of the surrounding solvent. The surface acidity can, in principle, be evaluated from the kinds of simulations that were performed in this work. For example, Wang

 <sub>a</sub> = 3.0 ± 0.1, by considering the free-energy proton transfer barrier from the surface into the bulk liquid. However, in the present work, we did not observe the transfer of any PHCs, other than those during transient solvent-assisted PT events, into the bulk liquid. For this reason, we cannot explicitly evaluate the surface acidity from the present simulations.
