  <p>CdS QRs aligned in the nanofiber sheets by electrospinning. a) TEM image of a nanofiber with aligned QRs. The diameter of QRs is ≈5 nm and length is ≈40 nm. Frames (b) and (c) represent polarization microphotographs of a nanofiber sheet (b) when the polarizer is parallel to the emission polarization and c) when the polarizer is perpendicular to the emission polarization. d) The aligned QR nanofiber sheets. The white arrow indicates the polarization direction, which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the sheet shown on the left‐hand side, and parallel for that on the right‐hand side.
