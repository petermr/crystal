Excess acid was used to ensure that the amines were completely protonated, and a rotary evaporator was utilized to help the crystallization of ammonium salts. Then, PbBr
 <sub>2</sub>, OABr, and MABr were mixed in dimethylformamide (DMF) with desired proportions and underwent heating to form a uniform solution. Finally, under vigorous agitation, this precursor solution was dropwise added into toluene. The product was precipitated by centrifugation and was redispersed in toluene. As the ratio of OA increases, the thickness of the nanosheet gradually shrinks until reaching a monolayer.
