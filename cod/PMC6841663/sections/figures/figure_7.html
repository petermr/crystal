 <caption> Snapshot of complex trajectories made by quenching from the temperature condition of the isotropic structure ( θ = 5.5) to that of the smectic-like structure ( θ = 1.5). The yellow particles belong to LCPs, and the gray particles are LC molecules for swelling. The trajectories exhibit complex local structures, but it is difficult to visually classify each local structure. </caption>
