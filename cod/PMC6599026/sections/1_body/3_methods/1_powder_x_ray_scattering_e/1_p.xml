 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.15720(1) Å using a FReLoN camera for diffraction pattern acquisition. A nitrogen cryostream was used to collect patterns between 90 and 400 K in 10 K steps. Small anomalies seen in several refined quantities around 250–300 K in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> most likely reflect ice in the sample vicinity leading to additional scattering contributions, as magnetite does not have an intrinsic lattice anomaly in this temperature region. A hot air blower was used to collect data between 498 and 923 K in 50 K steps. Empty capillary data were collected at 90, 200, 473, 573, 673, 773, and 873 K. For each data set, the temperature was stabilised for 10 min and then data were collected for 10 min using the accumulation mode of the detector for 10-s exposure frames. Data were also collected from CeO
 <sub>2</sub> and Si standards at 300 K to calibrate the instruments and determine instrumental parameters.
