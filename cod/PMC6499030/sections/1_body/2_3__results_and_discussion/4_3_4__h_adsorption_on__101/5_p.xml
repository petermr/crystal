<p>It has been stated before that the introduction of defects on TiO
 <sub>2</sub> can lead to a modification of the band gap value (Naldoni et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mehta et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, a comparison of the computed electronic structure of the stoichiometric and defective surface is presented and the band gap is indicated. The adsorption of hydrogen on anatase (101) leads to a small reduction of the band gap of around 2 % in both the HSE and B3LYP approximations (this result agrees with the value of 1.8% found by diffusion reflectance spectroscopy Mehta et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In calculations based on PBE+U the inclusion of defects produces no change in the band gap.
