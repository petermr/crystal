<p id="Par27">A further increase of 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> leads for both models to the instability of some clusters. In such cases, clusters disappear and immediately reform. The number of unstable clusters increases as 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> grows, without destroying the global order of the pattern. While in the AOUP case clusters simply blow up, in the ABP case we can clearly see the deformation of the ring-like aggregates into lines after which the cluster can reform. Then, the growth of 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> produces the formation of continuous flows of particles while other groups of particles arrange in the hexagonal pattern (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c,f</xref>). In other words, we observe the coexistence of the cluster-crystal phase with the disordered phase. Finally, the formation of any stable structure for both models is prevented by a further increase of 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, a regime which is not under investigation in the present manuscript.
