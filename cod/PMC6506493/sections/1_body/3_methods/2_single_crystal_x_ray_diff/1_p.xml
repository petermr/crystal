 </sup>, we reexamined the crystal structure at room temperature by using a RIGAKU R-AXIS RAPID three-circle X-ray diffractometer equipped with an imaging plate area detector. Monochromatic Mo-K
 <italic>α</italic> radiation with a wavelength of 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.71075 Å was used as the X-ray source. Data integration and global-cell refinements were performed using data in the range of 3.119° &lt; 
 <italic>θ</italic> &lt; 30.508°, and absorption correction based on face indexing and integration on a Gaussian grid was also performed. The total number of reflections observed was 73781, among which 5947 reflections were found to be independent and 5096 reflections were determined to satisfy the criterion

 <italic>σ</italic>(
 <italic>I</italic>). Structural parameters were refined by the full-matrix least-squares method using SHELXL-97 software. The final 
 <italic>R</italic> indices obtained for

 <italic>σ</italic>(
 <italic>I</italic>) were 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.0376 and
