 </inline-formula> at room temperature was obtained using the data collected on the KAPPA APEX-II Ultra 4-circle diffractometer, with a molybdenum rotating anode as an X-ray source and multi-layer focusing mirrors. A single specimen was mounted on top of a thin glass capillary with epoxy resin. The data were collected with Bruker APEX-II software (Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI, USA) [
