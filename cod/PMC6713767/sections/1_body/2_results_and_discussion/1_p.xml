 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a shows the SEM image of pristine zeolite-3A. It can be observed that the morphology of the pristine zeolite-3A is irregular cubic structure with the side length of about 1.5 μm. Zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphors are obtained through high-temperature solid-state reaction method, without any reducing atmosphere. The morphology and structure of zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor obtained at 1400 °C for 3 h are characterized by the field emission scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction measurements, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows that the particles exhibit irregular morphology structure and the distribution of the crystallite sizes is not uniform. Comparing Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b with a, it can be found that the particles of zeolite are aggregated with each other after sintering at 1400 °C for 3 h. As can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, all the diffraction peaks in XRD pattern of zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor are in good agreement with the pure zeolite-3A phase (JCPDS no. 00-019-1227), and no other impurity peaks are observed. It means that Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions are successfully introduced into the zeolite host lattices and a certain amount of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions doping do not obviously change the crystal structure [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d shows TG curves of pure zeolite-3A and zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor sintered at 1400 °C. It can be seen that there is a continuous mass loss during heating up to about 266 °C in TG curve for pure zeolite-3A, where it reaches a value about 19.45%. This is corresponded to the liberation of physically bound water localized in the zeolite-3A cavities and channels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The phenomenon of mass loss is not obvious as increasing temperature sequentially. As seen from TG curve of zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor sintered at 1400 °C, there is almost no mass loss. These results indicate that zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu sintered at 1400 °C is very stable.
