<p id="Par5">In this work, the comprehensive studies are carried out to investigate the effect of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-doping on the structural and optical properties of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub> NCs (x up to 15%). The ultimate goal of this work is to realize the low-cost, highly efficient, and environmental-friendly white light with superior color quality. The inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub> NCs results in a lattice contraction, however, the NCs maintain identical crystal structure and the morphology. The as-grown NCs exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) emissions that are blue-shifted with increasing Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> content because of the reduced size of unit cells while maintaining the high PLQY (&gt;16% for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> and &gt;80% for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub>). In addition, the tunable bandgap from 1.82 eV to 3.19 eV and tunable emission from 411 nm to 636 nm are obtained by engineering the halide compositions for 15% Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> inclusion. Furthermore, the prototype WLEDs based on CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub> NCs (for 15% Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>) are experimentally demonstrated by stacking the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-alloyed blue-, green-, yellow-, and red-emitting NCs on top of a UV LED. The WLEDs emit white light with a tunable CCT from warm to cold (2218–8335 K). In addition, an extra high CRI (maximized to 93) and high LER (268–318 lm·W
 <sup>−1</sup>) are achieved which is superior to the previous studies on WLEDs based on metal halide perovskites doped with other transition metals. Thus, this work opens up new prospects to engineer the properties of compositionally diverse lead-reduced halide perovskite NCs potentially to be used in lighting technology.
