 <sub>2</sub> were found during the redaction of this review. One of them was the mixture of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> and Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, giving the best results with a molar ratio of 6:1, respectively [
 <xref rid="B225-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. In that system, the released hydrogen was 8.2 wt.% up to 450 Â°C. Reactions (45) and (46) initiate the dehydrogenation pathway. Subsequently, LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> reacts as: [
