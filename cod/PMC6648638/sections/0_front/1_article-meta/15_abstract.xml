 <p>White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been achieved using photopolymerization. Red and green CdSe/ZnS core–shell quantum dots (QDs) are dispersed in photopolymerized aliphatic acrylic acrylate resins, cured by using 36 W UV light for 1.5 min producing QD–acrylate nanocomposites, and then a hybrid LED device is achieved using the QD–acrylate nanocomposite with two emission wavelengths excited by using a blue InGaN LED chip. The cured QD–acrylate nanocomposite films are characterized by using ultraviolet–visible, fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis measurements. Photopolymerization is conveniently employed to adjust several parameters of the CIE-1931 coordinate (
  <italic>x</italic>, 
  <italic>y</italic>), color temperature, and color rending index (CRI). Good white balance of the red-green hybrid device achieves a luminance of 7976 lm/m
  <sup>2</sup> at a 30 mA working current. The light emission efficiency, CRI, and color temperature of 14%, 47, and 11 204 K, respectively, are attained at this working current.
