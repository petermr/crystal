It is worth stressing that the twin period has been estimated by TEM measurements performed on the very same wires after Raman measurements. Notice that the period length of the NW in

 </xref>b closely compares to one of the cases considered in our theoretical calculations (

 </xref>a), thus we compare the frequencies of the modes between the TO and LO modes originated from the back-folding in

  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>. The phonon frequencies are given as a relative shift with respect to the TO mode to get rid of the slight underestimation of phonon frequencies by DFPT. Considering the experimental error, we find a remarkable agreement between theory and experiment. Notice that the peak with 24.6 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> frequency shift is quite broad, and thus it is probably resulting from a convolution of the separate 23.5 and 27.0 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> modes predicted by theory.
