 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays the 
 <italic>operando</italic> photoelectron microspectroscopy system for the all solid-state LIBs. A photoelectron map could be obtained by scanning a soft X-ray beam focused on a sample using a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) and detecting the photoelectrons at each beam spot. An 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell for the all solid-state LIBs was prepared for photoelectron microspectroscopy in a high vacuum chamber.
