<p>As mentioned above, ions with different 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> values may have different local structures. To further clarify this difference, we divide both Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup> in the first layer into two classes, namely, coordinating with (hereafter labeled as type I, namely, 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> &gt; 0) and without (hereafter labeled as type II, namely, 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0) counter ions. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>c, the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-O RDFs for both type I and type II are similar, and the main difference appears in the first peaks. However, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>d, there are some remarkable difference in the Cl
 <sup>–</sup>-O RDF between type I and type II. First, the first peak of Cl
 <sup>–</sup>-O RDF of type II is much higher than that of type I, due to more water molecules around type II Cl
 <sup>–</sup>. Second, near the first minimum of the Cl
 <sup>–</sup>-O RDF of type II, a small peak appears in the Cl
 <sup>–</sup>-O RDF of type I. These results may be the explanation why the radius of FHS of Cl
 <sup>–</sup> is different before and after dissolution.

 </sup> Third, around the second peak of the Cl
 <sup>–</sup>-O RDF of type II, a minimum and a small peak appear in the RDF of type I.
