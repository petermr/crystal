 <caption> Thermal variations of parameters from magnetite pair distribution function (PDF) fits. a Isotropic temperature factors U isos for tetrahedral Fe A, octahedral Fe B, and oxygen sites and the cubic cell parameter from fits to the First Unit Cell PDF range. b Verwey shifts f V fitted to First, Second and Third Unit Cell PDF ranges. f V represents the magnitude of structural distortions due to electronic fluctuations in the cubic phase of magnetite above T V. The First Unit Cell values show that substantial local structural distortions persist up to T C and closely match the variation of bulk magnetisation data taken from ref. 18 . This demonstrates that the structural and electronic fluctuations responsible for the Verwey transition are a direct result of the long-range magnetic order. c Comparison of the atomic displacements due to electronic fluctuations d V, calculated from atomic coordinates for the First Unit Cell f V values, and those due to thermal motion taken as d T = √ U iso from values shown in a. Error bars are estimated standard deviations from the refinements </caption>
