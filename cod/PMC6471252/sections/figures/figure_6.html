 <caption> Variation of the ( a) inter-planar distances in a π -stack with pressure; the purple-grey pair represents the “dimer” within the stack; ( b) lateral shifts involving 1 a molecules within a “dimer” (purple circles) and molecules from consecutive dimers (magenta squares) with pressure. The centers of each pyrene moiety represented as blue dots, crystallographic centers of symmetry—as yellow dots. Experimental results represented by filled markers with uncertainties, results of theoretical calculations by empty ones. </caption>
