<p>To control the sample reflectance in the visible range while also maintaining a strong absorption in the ultraviolet and near infra-red ranges is an interesting challenge for opening various applications (as solar filter, for instance). It is possible by modulating the sub-stoichiometry amount in oxygen, which is responsible for the strong variations of the optical properties observed. For such a proposal, two solutions have been considered: the first one consists in varying the post-annealing temperatures in air atmosphere to limit the re-oxidation of the raw sub-stoichiometric sample (blue sample); the second one is to perform post-annealing treatment at a fixed temperature of 600 Â°C while the redox conditions are balanced, thanks to the control of the annealing treatment atmosphere (with different oxygen partial pressures).</p>
