<p>It is noted that selectivity is an essential characteristics in the detection of heavy metal ions, because they usually coexist in the contaminated water. However, the present SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs show a fluorescence response to all of them. It is necessary to develop the ability to discriminate among heavy metal ions for a practical sensor. The technique using a neural network is one of the candidates for the potential device, which contains a sensor array with various sensing properties, e.g., sensors with various Sn concentrations. Each sensor in the array would be trained by a series of fluorescence responses to an individual type of heavy metal ion or a mixture of them. Then, the device would acquire the ability of discrimination to a specific type of heavy metal ion after a group of fluorescence responses is collected. In addition, the heavy metal ions of Cd
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> were investigated in the present work because they are typical pollutants in the environment. These heavy metal ions are representative pollutants, which were used to develop SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QD photoluminescence sensors. Other heavy metal ions, such as Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Hg
 <sup>2+</sup>, will need to be investigated as target pollutants in further researches. There were four different background solutions in the present work, including deionized water, deionized water with 10 ppm Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, reclaimed water and sea water. All of them were used to check the validity of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs in the detection of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>. Although the prepared QDs were able to detect Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions as a photoluminescence sensor, the sensor performances are different in those background solutions. Therefore, it was necessary to study the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QD properties in a diversity of background solutions so that it can be put into practical use.
