 </sup> exchange-correlation functional and a kinetic energy cutoff of 300 eV were employed. Spin–orbit coupling was included in the calculations due to the heavy Pb atoms. To model the surface passivation, we built a CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> slab with the top surface layer covered by [YCl
 <sub>6</sub>] octahedra. The cell size is 1.2 nm × 1.2 nm × 2.3 nm. A vacuum thickness of 15 Å was used to eliminate spurious periodic interactions between the slabs. The bottom two layers of [PbBr
 <sub>6</sub>] octahedra were fixed at their relaxed bulk positions, while all other atoms were relaxed with a force tolerance of 0.01 eV Å

 <italic>k</italic> mesh of 4 × 4× 1 was used to sample the Brillouin zone.
