<p>White-light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs) are potentially useful solid-state lighting devices because of their long service life, high luminous efficiency, energy saving, and environmental protection [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The widely used commercial w-LEDs are usually realized by combining blue light LED chips with YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> yellow phosphors [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, these commercial w-LEDs are not ideal due to their poor color rendering index, since the YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> yellow phosphors lack the red-light emission peaks [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many references have also been reported to improve their optical performance. The most common approaches are to add red-emitting phosphors [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] such as Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>-activated fluoride [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], oxide phosphors [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and red-emitting CdSe/ZnS semiconductor quantum dots [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> yellow-emitting phosphor. However, these approaches might result in the reabsorption among different phosphors, potentially reduce luminous efficiency, and limit their further application for w-LEDs [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, we think it is still of great significance to explore novel yellow phosphors with emission peaks in the green, yellow, and red regions under the excitation of blue light [
