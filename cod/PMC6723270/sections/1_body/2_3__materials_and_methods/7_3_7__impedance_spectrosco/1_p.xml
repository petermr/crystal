<p>For impedance spectroscopy analysis, expressed as a function of temperature, the powder samples were uniaxially pressed at about 51 MPa to obtain pellets approximately 1.37 mm thick and 10 mm in diameter [

 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The pellets were kept between two platinum electrodes (the effective diameter for the working electrode was 10 mm) under spring-loaded pressure. The setup was put inside a furnace with temperature control from 298 to 423 K in steps of 25 K, and, in this case, measurements were taken using a dielectric interface SOLARTRON 1296 coupled to SOLARTRON 1260 analyzer (Solartron Analytical, Farnborough, UK). The cell was allowed to reach thermal stability for about 20 min before each measurement. Data were recorded in a frequency range of 10 MHz to 0.1 Hz with a voltage amplitude of 100 mVrms and 0 DC bias. The fitting circuit simulation of AC impedance data was performed with ZView
