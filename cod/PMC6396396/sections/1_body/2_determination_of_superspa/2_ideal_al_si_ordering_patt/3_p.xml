<p>For M25 and M40 there are 8008 and 38 760 Al/Si permutations, respectively, and the computational cost to study all of them with DFT is very high. Therefore, all supercells were geometrically optimized with FF methods and assigned an FFID according to the respective total energy. The most stable supercells (low FFIDs) were considered for DFT calculations, although additional calculations were carried out for a better overview. Fig. 5
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> ▸</xref> compares graphically the relative energies of M25, M33, M40 and M50. Absolute total energies, relative energies and selected characteristics of the Al/Si ordering pattern are given in the supporting information in Table S4. To identify different supercells the rank as determined by the DFT calculations is given with the hashtag symbol. For example, the most stable supercell of M50 considered to show ideal Si distribution is labelled M50 #1.
