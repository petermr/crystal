<p>The isoelectric point for initial nanoparticles is observed at pH = 6.5. In this case, the surface charge density is insufficient to prevent nanoparticles from agglomerating and forming large nanoparticle stability agglomerations. As an outcome of thermal annealing and the formation of CeFeO
 <sub>3</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> phases in the nanoparticle structure, the isoelectric point shifts towards pH = 4. That indicates an increase in inertness to self-organization and conglomeration of nanoparticles. The increase in inertia is connected to the formation of new phases in the structure and the emergence of a magnetic texture characteristic of hematite.
