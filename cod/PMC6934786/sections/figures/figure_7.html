 <caption> Schematic representation of charge transport in GDOS: Schematic illustration of charge transport governed by two different sections of the GDOS. When the Fermi level lies near the tail of the GDOS, transport is described by thermally activated hopping. As the Fermi level moves towards the central region, band-like transport becomes possible. </caption>
