<p>The change in the four angles is hard to explain within a simple physical picture or model, but surely it is closely related to the crystal surface because the most significant changes occur in the crystal surface. Two factors may play the major role: (1) The structure of the crystal surface. It promotes the ordered arrangement of ions, thus destroying the hydration structure and leads to the redistribution of water molecules. (2) The Coulomb field formed by anions and cations in the crystal makes the water molecules at the surface to rearrange with a specific orientation. These two factors, together with the hydration structure of ions, lead to the ordering distribution of water molecules in the FHS and slight disordering in dipole orientations.</p>
