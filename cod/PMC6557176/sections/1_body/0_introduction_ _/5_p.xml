<p>Diffracted intensities can be collected by various detectors. The current state of the art are solid-state area detectors which provide information on a large angular range together with fast data acquisition. The drawback here is that, owing to construction limitations, blind areas exist on the detector. These can be readily accepted for experiments with sufficient redundant data, but otherwise additional measurements need to be taken. Hereby the detector is moved by a certain amount by the goniometer or laterally, so that the blind areas point towards other areas of reciprocal space. From these additional measurements, (larger) images containing all of the diffraction information can be obtained.</p>
