<p id="Par20">The structures consist of the loss and gain medium with a positive and negative imaginary part respectively. Generally, the acoustic loss materials are ubiquitous in nature because acoustic loss can be easily caused by viscous elasticity. It should be noted that a natural acoustic gain media has not yet been found. However, it can be effectively realized by well-designed feedback systems

 </sup>. More specifically, the proposed structures can be realized by using the sensors and pre-amplifiers. The sensed signal is amplified in a pre-amplifier of appropriate gain progression. In addition, an equivalent acoustic gain system can be constructed by combining auxiliary devices such as microphones and loudspeakers.
