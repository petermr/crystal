<p>Finally, we attempt to address oxygen diffusion in terms of migration barriers. The paramagnetic phase is chosen for the calculations, since it may correspond to the temperature range of interest for the intermediated temperature fuel cell application. Our calculations are carried out based on the following reasoning. To practically simulate the oxygen diffusion process in the case that PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub> is implemented in the fuel cell device, one added oxygen atom is assumed to be externally supplied as a fuel. When an oxygen atom comes into the oxide, at the beginning, the oxygen may prefer to occupy one of the oxygen vacancies or to be positioned near the vacant sites in the one-dimensional vacancy channel-like structure formed at the Pr–O layers. In case of the former, the possible path of oxygen migration to the next position would be six by crystal symmetry, as illustrated in

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>. The migration energy barriers for the six paths thus determine the most likely diffusion path in terms of energy. It is also expected that the position of oxygen in the latter case may appear to be the lowest energy point between the calculated migration path. We exclude the Ba–O layers in which the formation of oxygen vacancy is highly unlikely, as we discussed above.
