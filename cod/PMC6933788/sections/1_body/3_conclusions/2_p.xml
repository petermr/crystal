<p>In summary, the single crystal of Rb
 <sub>3</sub>Na(H
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>·3H
 <sub>2</sub>O was obtained with the hydrothermal method in a short synthesis period. The calculated birefringence of Rb
 <sub>3</sub>Na(H
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>·3H
 <sub>2</sub>O is about 0.368, its ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edge is down to 230 nm, the SHG intensity is about 0.2 × KDP, and phase matchable. We believe that this work could contribute to the development of the cyanurates and hydro-isocyanurates.
