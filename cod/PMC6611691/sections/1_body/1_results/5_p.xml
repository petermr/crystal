<p>This asymmetric MR is found to be independent of current direction. 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> shows the evolution of the ADMR within the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane for 
 <italic>I</italic>//
 <italic>b</italic> (similar data for 
 <italic>I</italic>//
 <italic>c</italic> are shown in fig. S3). Above 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>, the mirror symmetry is preserved with respect to the crystallographic axes. Below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>, the asymmetric behavior is observed at all temperatures. The magnitude of the asymmetry, however, does depend on the field strength. 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> shows the enhanced asymmetry with increasing field up to 30 T measured on a different LMO crystal at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 1.2 K (see almost identical behavior in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> for another insulating crystal and in fig. S6b for a second, superconducting crystal). As the field increases, the position of the maximum MR shifts away from the crystallographic axes. Notably, when the magnetic field is rotated within the 
 <italic>ab</italic> or 
 <italic>bc</italic> plane, there is no discernible shift in the position of the maxima/minima across 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> (see also figs. S3 and S4). No shift is found either with increasing field strength (fig. S5). Such a dependence of the asymmetric MR on the specific plane of rotation places strong constraints on any effective theory put forward to explain this effect.
