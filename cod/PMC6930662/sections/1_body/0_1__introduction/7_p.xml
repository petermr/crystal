<p>Our attention will also be given to the self-assembly mechanism of azo–BTA stars. According to the latest scientific ideas in this field, three scenarios of the supramolecular assembly are distinguished: cooperative, isodesmic and ring-chain mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Two of them, cooperative [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and isodesmic [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], were identified for BTA-centered molecules. In a recent review, the “structure–mechanism” correlation has been established and the ordering behaviors of BTA-containing derivatives were placed on the so-called cooperativity scale [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, the analysis of the signatures of self-assembly is the second aim of this study.
