<p>The formation of the desired compound Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn is highly sensitive to the initial ratios of Mn to Pt during the crystal growth. The initial ratios of 1.4–2:1 for Mn and Pt afford single crystals of an undesired compound having the composition, Mn
 <sub>22</sub>Pt
 <sub>30</sub>Sn
 <sub>48</sub>. To suppress the formation of Mn
 <sub>22</sub>Pt
 <sub>30</sub>Sn
 <sub>48</sub>, we took the relatively high Mn and Pt ratio of 3:1, which resulted in the formation of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn. During the flux growth, when the reaction mixture was cooled from high temperatures (∼1273 K), the obtained crystals were always microtwinned. The formation of microtwinning can be understood in terms of martensitic phase transition, wherein single crystals are initially formed in the cubic phase, after which they transform into the tetragonal phase upon cooling, affording microtwinned plates of different orientations.
