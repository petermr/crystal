<p id="Par14">As mentioned in the introduction, these complex structures could be “activated” by chemical reactions or biological mechanisms taking place inside or on the surface of such a complex microswimmer, so that each individual self-propels in a preferential direction in the same way as a simple rod-like active particle in the absence of any structure. The occurrence of a driving velocity could deform the structure of the polymer, destroying its circular symmetry and altering the shape of the effective interaction given by Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). But when the speed induced by the self-propulsion is smaller than the typical velocities of the “microscopic” components of the polymer (for instance, the arms of star polymers) then the structural changes of the polymer shape would be negligible and our description in terms of point particles with effective interaction and self-propulsion remains valid. We restrict in the following to this regime.
