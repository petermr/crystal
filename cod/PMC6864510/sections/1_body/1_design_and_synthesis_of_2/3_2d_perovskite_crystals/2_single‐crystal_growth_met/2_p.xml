<p>Single crystal is the most useful state to analyze the structure and physical properties of materials. 2D single‐crystalline perovskites have been synthesized by a variety of solution methods. Liquid‐phase crystallization involves dissolving the divalent metal halide (MX
 <sub>2</sub>) and organic amine halide (RNH
 <sub>2</sub>·HX) at high temperatures in solvent, then mixing them together to start the crystal growth, and later cooling them to room temperature at a certain cooling rate to quench the further growth; (mixed) solvent evaporation is similar to the liquid‐phase crystallization. The single crystals are obtained by evaporating solvent(s) at a relatively slow rate, while the solvent evaporation can be accelerated by adding another solvent; the layered solution method involves dissolving the two reactants in two solvents with certain mutual solubility, and the two solutions have obvious density difference, so as to form a clear interface between the two solutions due to the different solubility and density. With a slow diffusion, large‐sized single crystal is precipitated at the interface. These solution methods have some advantages of stability, low cost, and easy operation. The main solution‐processed methods for synthesizing 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are summarized in
