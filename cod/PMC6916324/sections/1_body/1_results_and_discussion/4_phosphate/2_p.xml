<p>In the experiment, the BCP is slightly more shifted towards the electropositive phosphorus atom, indicating a marginally higher ionic character in the experimental than in DFT data. Cremer and Kraka

 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> the ratio of potential to kinetic‐energy density |V|G can be used to distinguish between shared, intermediate and closed‐shell interactions. For a closed‐shell interaction, the ratio |V|G at the bond‐critical point is less than unity, for a shared interaction greater than two, and for an intermediate interaction between one and two. The ratios |V|G for the P−O bonds ranging from 1.82 to 1.93 [1.90–2.01] are much more on the side of the shared interaction. If the ratio of the kinetic‐energy density per electron density at the BCP is greater than unity, this is indicative for polarity in a bond.
