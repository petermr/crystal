<p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) determinations seek to separate and identify the global electrode reactions into different contributions evidenced by distinct impedance arcs. The reaction steps are time-dependent and are represented in terms of frequency (s
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>). Each charge-transfer limiting process (i.e., electrolyte, electrode process, etc.) occurs at a distinct characteristic frequency, resulting in a separate arc of the impedance diagram [

 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-01957" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The time-response of each individual process for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is often modeled in terms of an equivalent circuit. The high frequency (HF) contribution is attributed to the oxygen-ion transfer process from the electrode to the electrolyte. A medium frequency (MF) signal is assigned to oxygen ion diffusion co-limited by charge transfer, and a low frequency (LF) region due to dissociated absorption [
