<p id="Par15">In this study, Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> doped natural sodium feldspar (NaAlSi
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>) phosphors were been successfully prepared by using high-temperature solid-state method with natural sodium feldspar as a substrate. EDX analysis showed that the natural matrix albite in this experiment contained a small amount of C, Ca, and Eu elements except the main elements Na, Al, Si, and O. The percentage of the weight of the Eu element is 0.03%, and the distribution is not uniform. Spectral analysis of phosphors shows that natural albite containing Eu does not form any luminescent centers after heat treatment without Tb
 <sup>3+</sup>. After doping Tb
 <sup>3+</sup>, the emission peak 615â€‰nm (Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>) increases with the increase of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. The excitation peaks corresponding to Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> were observed when the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> characteristic emission was monitored. According to the above spectral results, the energy transfer from Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> was obtained. The fluorescence lifetime of the sample confirmed the existence of energy transfer between Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>. The color coordinate results showed that the sample luminescence can be regulated in the green to red region. Starting from natural materials, a new type of luminescent material is synthesized, which is a feasible and economical way.
