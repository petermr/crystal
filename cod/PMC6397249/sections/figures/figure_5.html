 <caption> Color Coordinates vs. Metallic Glass Molar Fraction. Plots of CIELAB L*, a*, and b* coordinates vs. the metallic glass molar fraction x. Roughly linear dependencies are revealed, suggesting that the overall color of the composite follows the rule of mixtures, which implies that the microstructures of the composites are visually unresolved. </caption>
