<p>The rearrangement of directional interactions (e.g., OH···O, NH···O, and CH···O bonds or O···O contacts) is especially essential to interpret the modifications of compressed molecular crystals.

 </sup> From the DORI viewpoint, the CH···O bridges are the key to rationalize the BCA covalent pattern. As pressure is applied, several CH···O DORI domains slide from the typical CH···O to the unconventional

 </xref>). The C2 and C5 carbon atoms involved in those noncovalent contacts are both located in the same seven-membered ring (C1–C2–C3–C4–C5–C6–C15), explaining the stronger bond length alternation in the left part of the molecule. The right side of the BCA molecule is involved in strong CH···O contacts that remain in the annulene plane, disturbing the C–C covalent patterns to a lesser extent. At even higher pressure, we can expect those interactions to slide out of the pseudoplane, disturbing the symmetry on both sides.
