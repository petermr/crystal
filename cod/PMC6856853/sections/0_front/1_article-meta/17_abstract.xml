 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>The terminal diarsene HAs=AsH ligand attracts special interest concerning its bonding relation in comparison to its isolable relative, ethene. Herein, by the methanolysis of [{Fe(CO)
  <sub>4</sub>}As(SiMe
  <sub>3</sub>)
  <sub>3</sub>] (
  <bold>1</bold>) the synthesis of [{Fe(CO)
  <sub>4</sub>}(η
  <sup>2</sup>‐As
  <sub>2</sub>H
  <sub>2</sub>)] (
  <bold>2</bold>) is reported, containing a parent diarsene as unprecedented side‐on coordinated ligand. Following this synthetic route, also the D‐labeled complex [{Fe(CO)
  <sub>4</sub>}(η
  <sup>2</sup>‐As
  <sub>2</sub>D
  <sub>2</sub>)] (
  <bold>2D</bold>) could be isolated. The electronic structure and bonding situation of 
  <bold>2</bold> was elucidated by DFT calculations revealing that 
  <bold>2</bold> is best described as an olefin‐like complex. Moreover, the reactivity of 
  <bold>2</bold> towards the Lewis acids [{M(CO)
  <sub>5</sub>}(thf)] (M=Cr, W) was investigated, leading to the complexes [Fe(CO)
  <sub>4</sub>AsHW(CO)
  <sub>5</sub>]
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <bold>3</bold>) and [{Fe(CO)
  <sub>4</sub>}
  <sub>2</sub>AsH{Cr(CO)
  <sub>5</sub>}] (
  <bold>4</bold>), respectively.
