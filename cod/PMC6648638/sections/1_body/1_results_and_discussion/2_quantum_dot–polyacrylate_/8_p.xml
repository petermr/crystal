<p>A traditional liquid crystal television using a white light-emitting diode (WLED) as a backlight is called an “LED-TV”, which uses a color filter to generate three colors of RGB light. Therefore, red and green quantum dots can be directly printed between the two poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films to replace the role of the backlight on the panel. High adhesion of the quantum dot–polymer hybrid is required in the real application. The 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMSPMA) monomer having methoxysilyl groups is generally considered to enhance the adhesion on PET sheets. Furthermore, the light extraction efficiency of the quantum dot–polymer composite films would not be significantly influenced by the addition of TMSPMA lower than 10 wt %. In this work, the TMSPMA monomer was added into the mixture of CdSe/ZnS (0.1 wt %) quantum dot–B2 oligomer hybrid white light-emitting formulation to enhance adhesion between the two PET plastic substrates (2 cm × 2 cm) after photopolymerization. The pull-off strength was measured by a universal material testing machine to obtain the relationship between the TMSPMA content and pull-off strength. As shown in

 </xref>, it can be observed that the pull-off strength increases with the increasing TMSPMA addition to reach a maximum value of 8.9 N/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 5 wt % TMSPMA. The enhancement is just 43.5% higher compared to that (6.2 N/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) without the addition of TMSPMA. This result arises from the hydrolysis of Si–(OCH
