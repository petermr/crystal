<p>This paper is organized as follows: 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-sensors-19-04980">Section 1</xref> introduces the current situation of service robots at home and abroad and extends to the food delivery machine. In addition, the research status of indoor positioning technology is expounded, and the advantages and disadvantages of various positioning technologies are roughly compared. At the same time, the main multi-sensor information fusion algorithms at home and abroad are introduced. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-sensors-19-04980">Section 2</xref> introduces the positioning system design, which including the robot modeling, odometer positioning method, and optimization, UWB positioning method and EKF fusion of the previous two algorithms. At last, meal delivery robot trajectory control is introduced. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-sensors-19-04980">Section 3</xref> introduces the experiment and result analysis. The experiment is divided into three parts: The UWB positioning system experiment, coordinate calculation experiment for improved odometer positioning method, and the EKF fusion algorithm coordinate fusion experiment. The previous two experiments obtained the positioning results of the UWB positioning system and the improved odometer positioning method, respectively, and analysis of the error and source. Finally, the EKF fusion algorithm is used to fuse the positioning results of the two algorithms to obtain better positioning results with better accuracy and stability. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-sensors-19-04980">Section 4</xref> is the conclusion. By this algorithm, the trajectory error of the food delivery robot can be less than 15 cm, whose precision is acceptable for the application field such as in a restaurant.
