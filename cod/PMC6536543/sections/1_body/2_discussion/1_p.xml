<p id="Par19">The present study using a combination of powder and single-crystal XRD, Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations clearly shows the existence of a novel silicate-carbonate polymorph under high P-T conditions. At 8 GPa, tilleyite, a naturally-occurring silicate-carbonate mineral transforms into a denser phase which presents a large variety of environments for Ca atoms, from six-fold to nine-fold coordination. The different classes of irregular cation-centered oxygen polyhedra exhibit a wide range of bulk moduli, which suggest that such a structure could accommodate other divalent cation species with different radii;

 <sub>3</sub> and CaF
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. This means that partial substitution of Si by Al atoms is possible and alkali metals of different sizes can also be hosted in both tilleyite and post-tilleyite structures. Our Raman data also shows the replacement of some oxygen atoms by OH groups. Note that potential chemical substitutions and the low symmetry of the post-tilleyite structure are envisaged to further stabilize this phase at high temperature via an increase of the entropic term.
