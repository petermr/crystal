<p id="Par44">The results of this paper are useful first of all for the explosion physics. The can be used in the investigation of the kinetics of the reaction zone in powerful HEs and for the development of the theory of hot spots. The results are actual for the industrial production of nanodiamonds especially for the development of a technology of the manufacture of a product with the desired properties. The results are also useful for the miniaturization of explosive devices and the increase of safety at the handling of HEs.</p>
