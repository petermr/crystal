<p>Inorganic pigments composed of metal oxides are applied in a broad range of fields, such as ceramics, glasses, plastics, and paints, because they have high hiding power, thermal stability, and weather resistance. In the case of inorganic orange pigments, cadmium orange (CdS·CdSe) and molybdate orange (PbCrO
 <sub>4</sub>·PbMoO
 <sub>4</sub>·PbSO
 <sub>4</sub>) were conventionally used. However, application of these orange pigments containing toxic elements, such as Cd, Pb, Cr, has been forbidden or restricted, because they have harmful effects on the human body and the environment. Therefore, development of inorganic orange pigments without toxic elements is required and several studies have been reported.
