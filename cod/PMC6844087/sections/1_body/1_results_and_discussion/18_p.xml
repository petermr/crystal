<p>Finally, the magnetic hysteresis cycle [M(H)] of these samples has been measured. As can be observed in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>, only the first magnetization curve and the demagnetization from the positive to the negative saturations have been measured. As the hysteresis cycle has a symmetric behavior when the magnetic field is reversed, these conditions are sufficient for measuring the properties under study in this work.
