<p>Further possibilities for future experiments are opened by the field-free imaging mode, being for the first time explored in this paper. This operation [Fig. 2(
 <italic>c</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>] allows free sample rotation in front of the entrance lens. The PEEM mode is helpful in order to keep the photon footprint in the same position during rotation. A further exciting (though not yet proven) future aspect is the possibility to reconstruct the full 4D spectral function from a measurement at a few photon energies or even just a single one, exploiting the curvature of the final-state sphere. Previously, this was done via tomography-like measurements at many photon energies (Medjanik 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb47"> ▸</xref>). The 
 <italic>k</italic>-field curvature along with the large field of view with many BZs leads to the fact that the contour crosses the BZs at different 
 <italic>k</italic>
