<p>In this work, we consider a total of 324 COFs reported experimentally from 2005 to 2018 (we refer to the Materials Cloud, see the Acknowledgements, for the references to the original structures), cleaned from solvent molecules, and with no partial occupations or disorder in the structures. We propose a systematic approach to organize and store these frameworks in a curated database, to track eventual corrections to the structures or additions to the database, and to link each entry back to its original source. The atomic coordinates and the cell dimensions have been optimized using density functional theory (DFT) to give a coherent geometry to all the frameworks. In addition, we have analyzed the results from DFT calculations to spot and correct errors in the structure and to achieve a robust and automated procedure to perform the DFT modeling and the optimization. DFT-derived partial charges of the structures are computed and provided for molecular simulations.</p>
