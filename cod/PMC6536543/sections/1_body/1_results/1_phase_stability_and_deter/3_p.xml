<p id="Par8">Single-crystal XRD measurements allow us to fully characterize the progressive transformations of the tilleyite structure with increasing pressure and the nature of the high-pressure silicate-carbonate phase. Our results show that in tilleyite there is a Ca–O distance that rapidly decreases upon compression, increasing the formal coordination number of one of the seven-fold coordinated Ca atoms to eight for pressures above 6 GPa (see crystallographic data of tilleyite at 7.9 GPa in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> of SI). Above 9 GPa, the crystal structure can no longer be described by the tilleyite

 <sub>1</sub> space group. The structure was solved with a dataset at 10.8 GPa that has a reciprocal space completeness of 26.7% up to a resolution of 0.46 Å. The position of the Ca and Si atoms was determined by SHELXT

 </sup>. Subsequent structural refinement and analysis of the difference-Fourier maps of the electron density function afforded localizing the rest of atoms of the unit cell. The final refinement of the structure was performed with SHELXL
