<p id="Par11">After introducing the active ultrasoft model in the ABP and AOUP versions, we present a numerical study, for high enough density, displaying a traveling cluster-crystal aggregation phase. The role of the active force is elucidated, determining at first the size of the cluster and then the occurrence of unstable regions, where clusters shrink and reform. Then, an effective description of the the system is developed, with the aim of describing both the microscopic dynamics of a particle within a cluster and the global dynamics of the pattern. Finally, we confine the system in a large channel to explore the interplay between the cluster-crystal phase and the accumulation near the walls. In the last Section we summarize the results discussing future perspectives in the conclusive section.</p>
