<p>The UV–vis reflectance spectrum of the (Bi
 <sub>0.97</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.03</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.06</sub> pigment was compared with those for the commercially available orange pigments such as Bayferrox 960 and Bayferrox 4960 (Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>–FeOOH, Ozeki Co., Ltd.), as shown in

 </xref>. The present (Bi
 <sub>0.97</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.03</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.06</sub> pigment showed higher reflectance in the wavelength region of 580–850 nm corresponding to the yellow-red light as compared with the commercially available orange pigments. But unfortunately, the reflectance in the green light region (520–570 nm) was also higher than those of the commercial ones.
