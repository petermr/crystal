<p>Most of the thermodynamic approaches (e.g., Ottonello et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, or the discussion above regarding the reaction enthalpy of equation 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>) do not describe however an important stage, which is nucleation. During solid‐state transformation when a product phase nucleates within the parent phase, the energy balance does correspond not only to the volume free energy but also to the interfacial energy. A combination of the two energies constrains the nucleation barrier. In the present case, we see that unlike wadsleyite, which forms irregular domains (inside olivine grains or at grain boundaries) with no preferential orientations with olivine, Anh‐B nucleates as thin lamellae. Most of them are inside the grains. We note that the larger one occurs at a grain boundary, which exhibits a specific orientation. This orientation yields a very small interfacial energy, which corresponds to the dislocation network observed on Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. For that reason, the energy barrier for nucleation of Anh‐B is likely smaller than for wadsleyite. As the phase grows, the contribution of interfacial energy becomes smaller and growth of the thermodynamically stable wadsleyite dominates. Another factor also probably inhibits the growth of Anh‐B. It must be remembered that only one side of the lamella can benefit from this low‐energy interface. On the other side grows the stishovite layer. We have no hint as to whether the Anh‐B/stishovite and stishovite/olivine interfaces have high or low interfacial energies. Also, besides equilibrium thermodynamics considerations, this decomposition into Anh‐B and stishovite must slow down as growth proceed since it requires diffusion of O and most importantly of Si across the Anh‐B lamella toward the stishovite lamella.
