<p>Against the near-room temperature stability of Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is the report of Schaeffer et al. [
 <xref rid="B250-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>]. They also produced Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> by means of metathesis of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> and an excess of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>. However, Schaeffer et al. considered Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> to be unstable at room temperature.
