<p>To also obtain clarity about the composition of α-SiB

 </sub> bulk samples, we performed a 
 <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR measurement of a sample that also contained a larger fraction unreacted nano-Si (about 20%). The 
 <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR spectrum of this sample, shown in

  <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>
 </xref>, revealed three distinct resonances. The signal with peak maximum at −104 ppm is attributed to unreacted Si, in agreement with ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>). The signals with peak maxima at 11 and −64 ppm are assigned to Si atoms in the polar icosahedral and dumbbell positions, respectively. With this assignment, the tetrahedrally coordinated dumbbell Si attains a chemical shift that is closer to that of the elemental structure, whereas the six-coordinated Si appears more deshielded because its electrons contribute to delocalized icosahedral bonding, which in turn would result in a positively polarized nature. Both signals are relatively broad, due to the 
 <sup>29</sup>Si chemical shifts distribution as a consequence of the disorder. The width of the signal of unreacted Si is similar to that reported for bulk Si nanopowder.
