 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> unit cell viewed in the z-direction. The four corners of each [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] tetrahedron are all shared with four adjacent [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] to forma Si-O frame structure in oxides, such as quartz. Because the Si in some tetrahedra is replaced by Al, there is excess negative charge, therefore the chemical formula of frame anion is generally written as (Al
 <sub>x</sub>Si

 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> has good chemical stability and rigidity
