 <caption> (a and b) Representative PL and absorbance (normalized on excitonic peak) spectra of DDAX-stabilized CsPb(Br 1– x Cl x ) 3 NCs (inset is the photograph of the colloidal solutions of CsPb(Br 1– x Cl x ) 3 NCs under UV-light excitation, λ=365 nm). (c) X-ray diffraction pattern of CsPbBr 3 (green) and CsPb(Br 1– x Cl x ) 3 (blue) and schematic illustration of the orthorhombic lattice of CsPb(Br 1– x Cl x ) 3 NCs. The diffractograms are shifted vertically for clarity. (d and e) Transmission electron microscopy images of CsPb(Br 1– x Cl x ) 3 NCs, for x = 0 and x = 0.24. </caption>
