<p>Understanding the structure of various soft matter systems is an important yet challenging problem of modern condensed matter physics. First of all, soft matter typically exhibits more degrees of freedom compared to conventional inorganic crystals. This is related to the fact that the basic units of soft matter, for example, organic molecules or nanoparticles, are much larger than atoms, and exhibit angular degrees of freedom, so not only their position, but also orientation in space become important for describing the structure of these systems. It is interesting to note that these orientational degrees of freedom were speculated to be the reason for fundamental differences in the non-equilibrium structure formation between molecular and atomic systems [

Second, many soft matter systems are known to display a structural hierarchy, for example, amphiphilic LC molecules may form bilayers or micelles, which in turn are organized in complex superstructures. Finally, due to the weak interaction between structural elements of soft matter systems and long relaxation times, different thermodynamically distinct structures may replace each other before the crystallization occurs.
