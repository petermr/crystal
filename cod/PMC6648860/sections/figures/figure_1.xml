  <p>(A) Refined crystal structure of MgTa

   <sub>3</sub>; N, Mg, and Ta atoms are represented as orange, pink, and gray spheres. (B) Backscattered electron SEM micrograph of MgTa
   <sub>2</sub>N
   <sub>3</sub> powder. (C) Characteristic EPS potential profile vs specific capacity (bottom axis) and vs moles of virtually extracted Mg

   <sub>2</sub>N
   <sub>3</sub> electrode (with 15% wt of Super P carbon) in Li cell, with 1
