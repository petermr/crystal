<p id="Par15">In conclusion, we have shown that both, hopping and band-like transport can be achieved in same organic system by varying the concentration of injecting carriers. This has been achieved by exploiting the presence and absence of pinch-off region by changing the polarity of source and drain in FETs. Band-like conduction associated with high mobility has been observed in positive

 </sub> regime due to the high concentration of injected carriers which moves the Fermi level near the center of the GDOS. Here, density of localized states is so high that charge carriers require negligible activation energy to move to neighboring sites and act like a wave, resulting in band-like transport. It is then also conceivable that this approach can possibly be used to access high mobility regimes in the broader class of disordered semiconductors and insulators.
