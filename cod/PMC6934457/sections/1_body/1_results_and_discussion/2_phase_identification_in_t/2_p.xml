<p id="Par9">The map of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ti–Ni–Cu ternary system is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>. The FWHM decreases following the red arrow with the contour lines almost parallel to the Cu–Ni edge. After heat treatment, the FWHM increased significantly compared with as-deposited state up to about 10% Ti boundary, while the FWHM at less than 10% Ti content is reduced. The diffraction pattern following the red arrow line before and after heat treatment are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e,f</xref>. The intensity of the peak significantly increased with the decreasing composition of Ti in the as-deposited state. After heat treatment, the peak strength weakened, and the peak width increased in most areas except for along the edge of Cu–Ni. The spectra from the corner of Ti to the boundary of about 50% Ti displayed no apparent peaks, which is indicative of the transition of crystal to glass during heat treatment. Although the peak strength of the Cu–Ni edge decreased significantly, the width of the peak became narrower. Before and after the solid-state reaction of the Ti–Ni–Cu ternary system, there were two regions showing the greatest change. In Ti-rich regions, the transition from crystal to the amorphous structure was completed, while in the region with less than 10% Ti content, the degree of crystallization was higher than it was before heat treatment.
