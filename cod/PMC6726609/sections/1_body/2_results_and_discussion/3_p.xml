<p id="Par13">After the second reaction, the morphology of the nanowire turned into nanorods which was covered by nickel hydroxide nanoflakes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The diameter of nanorods is about 170 nm, which shows significant overall increases in diameter than the nanowires. In addition, surface of the nanorods possesses a plicate morphology, leading to rich ions contact between the surface and electrolyte. To further observe growth and distribution of the material, lower SEM image is displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. Clearly, the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction nanorods are uniformly supported on the surface of Ni foam. This α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction nanorods material indicated a thickness of approximately 1 um (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), and the length is analogical to that of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires. EDX line scanning based nanorods was also detected. The distribution of higher Co and lower nickel element in the center section and lower Co and higher Ni in the edge area further confirms the heterojunction formed by cladding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The material that grows on the edge of Ni foam are further analyzed by EDX in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and quantity of the Ni, Co, C, N and O elemental are 18.7:4.9:19.1:8.2:49.2. The constituent of C and N are relatively high and the cause is the same as α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g,h</xref> we can obtain the element include Co and Ni display similar layout, thus proving uniform arrangement of Ni and Co elements. Furthermore, by analyzing the element scanning results of the nickel-foam skeleton with α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction, which further confirms homogeneity of the growth of heterojunction materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3i,j</xref>).
