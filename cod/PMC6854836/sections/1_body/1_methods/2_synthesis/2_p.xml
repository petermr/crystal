<p>Unless otherwise stated, starting materials for synthesis were amorphous boron (95–97%, ABCR GmbH (AB114507), &lt;1 μm average particle size), silicon powder with an average particle size 8 μm (99.995%, ABCR GmbH, in the following, we denote this material as “micron-Si”), and silicon powder with an average particle size &lt;50 nm (98%, Alfa Aesar; in the following, we denote this material as “nano-Si”). Before use, micron-Si was ground in an agate mortar, after which the particle size distribution was 1–5 μm. Boron was treated overnight in dynamic vacuum (10
 <sup>–4</sup>–10
 <sup>–5</sup> mbar) at 900 °C. All precursors were stored and handled for sample preparation in an Ar-filled glovebox. BN crucibles [8.5 mm outside diameter (OD), 6.5 mm inside diameter (ID), 10 mm height] or boron nitride powder (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), both used for confining reaction mixtures, were also degassed in a dynamic vacuum before use. Niobium ampoules (10 mm OD, 9 mm ID, about 50 mm length) were cleaned with dilute HCl and acetone before use.
