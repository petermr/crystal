<p>X-ray scattering is a well-established tool used to investigate the structure of complex materials. One of the main advantages of X-rays compared to other probes is high penetration length, which allows to study the bulk structure of the materials, in contrast to surface electron scattering, for example. For decades, the use of X-ray beams provided the means to obtain information on the average structure of soft matter and other forms of condensed matter. Nowadays, X-ray beams from modern coherent synchrotron sources can be focused below one hundred nanometers, which allows one to study the local structure by measuring the X-ray diffraction from a very small illuminated sample volume. It opens a unique opportunity to study the local arrangement of the structural elements in soft matter systems. However, many challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and radiation damage, require further development of techniques for experimental data analysis, which would allow one to extract as much information from the experimental data as possible.</p>
