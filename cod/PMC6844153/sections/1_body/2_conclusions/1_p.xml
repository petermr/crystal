<p>Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that 1–7 V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> SCAC structures would have direct band gaps, whereas bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> would have an indirect band gap, like Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> SCACs.

 </sup> By interpolation, we predicted that a 1D V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chain with a diameter less than ∼ 20 Å would have a direct band gap. Additionally, we investigated the effect of vdW interactions between chains on the DFT-D3 energy correction. DFT-D3 correction maintained the structures of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> bulk and SCAC roughly, but the interchain distances were reduced. Band gaps of few chain systems decrease as the number of chains increases, with and without DFT-D3 correction, and finally approach the band gaps of the bulk structure. The band structures of SCACs with 1–7 chains are similar, and DFT-D3 optimization retains the band structures of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> systems qualitatively; however, the band gaps were reduced by DFT-D3 correction. The optimized structures and band gaps for various numbers of chains of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> showed similar characteristics to those of Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. The dispersion energy does not change the band structure of these 1D materials, nor does it affect the indirect-to-direct band gap transition, unlike in the 2D material MoS
 <sub>2</sub>.
