<p>Jepsen et al. studied LiAlH

 <sub>2</sub> formed when the LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>-LiNH
 <sub>2</sub> ratio was 1:1.5, 1:2, and 1:2.5. This study supports that the LiNH
 <sub>2</sub> reacts with LiH to form Li
 <sub>2</sub>NH and H
 <sub>2</sub>. The main differences among the studies are mainly the molar proportions and milling conditions. This last parameter ranged from some minutes of manual milling in a mortar to several hours of mechanical milling. The use of additives, such as transition metal chlorides reduced, approximately 30 °C, the dehydrogenation temperature [

 <xref rid="B111-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] or 100 bar and 425 °C [
 <xref rid="B113-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. However, the reversibility does not rely on the formation of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>.
