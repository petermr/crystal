<p>On this basis, spherical, highly homogeneous, 100-nm-diameter Ag nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution were synthesized using a seed-mediated multistep process (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>; see also details in Materials and Methods). In this process, Au core nanoparticles with diameters in the range of 45 Â± 5 nm were prepared on the basis of the traditional Frens method, using sodium citrate (fig. S1A) (

 </xref>). Subsequently, these nanoparticles were covered with thick Ag shells to obtain the desired 100 nm diameter, thus producing Au-core Ag-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs) (

 </xref>). Note that the Au cores were introduced so as to increase both the stability and shape homogeneity of the Ag outer layers, while the size of the Au core less than 70 nm was found to have a negligible impact in terms of enhancement properties, as estimated by 3D-FDTD simulation with different Au core sizes (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These Au@Ag NPs were further coated with silica shells using a solution containing both 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and silicate at room temperature (

 </xref>) to form Au@Ag SHINs (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The silica shell layers on the surfaces of amplifiers had thicknesses in the range of 2 to 3 nm (fig. S2A) and provided a porous outer layer to which SNCs could adhere. Enhanced electromagnetic fields appear at the surfaces of these SHINs and decay exponentially with distance from the surfaces (fig. S2, B and C). Therefore, this spectroscopic technique selectively generates Raman signals of substances that are situated in close proximity to the surfaces of the SHINs.
