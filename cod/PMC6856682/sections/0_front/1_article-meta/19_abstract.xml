 <p>New iron complexes [Cp*Fe
  <bold>L</bold>]
  <sup>−</sup> (
  <bold>1‐σ and 1‐π</bold>, Cp*=C
  <sub>5</sub>Me
  <sub>5</sub>) containing the chelating phosphinine ligand 2‐(2′‐pyridyl)‐4,6‐diphenylphosphinine (
  <bold>L</bold>) have been prepared, and found to undergo facile reaction with CO
  <sub>2</sub> under ambient conditions. The outcome of this reaction depends on the coordination mode of the versatile ligand 
  <bold>L</bold>. Interaction of CO
  <sub>2</sub> with the isomer 
  <bold>1‐π</bold>, in which 
  <bold>L</bold> binds to Fe through the phosphinine moiety in an η
  <sup>5</sup> fashion, leads to the formation of 
  <bold>3‐π</bold>, in which CO
  <sub>2</sub> has undergone electrophilic addition to the phosphinine group. In contrast, interaction with 
  <bold>1‐σ</bold>—in which 
  <bold>L</bold> acts as a σ‐chelating [P,N] ligand—leads to product 
  <bold>3‐σ</bold> in which one C=O bond has been completely broken. Such CO
  <sub>2</sub> cleavage reactions are extremely rare for late 3d metals, and this represents the first such example mediated by a single Fe centre.
