<p>To obtain single crystals of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, Eu chunks, red phosphorus, and Sn granules were placed in an alumina crucible with the molar ratio of 1.1:2:20. The crucible was sealed into an evacuated quartz tube which was then heated to 600 °C and held for 24 h followed by a 2 day heat treatment at 1050 °C. After that, the tube was cooled to 600 °C at a rate of 3 °C/h. Excess Sn was centrifuged out after reaching 600 °C, and shiny hexagonal single crystals (∼1 × 1 × 0.1 mm
 <sup>3</sup>) were obtained.
