 <caption> (A) Projection of the refined crystal structure of Ca 0.89TaN 2 along the [210] direction. N, Ca, and Ta atoms are represented, respectively, as orange, magenta, and gray spheres. (B) Backscattered electron SEM image of CaTaN 2 sample. (C) Characteristic GCPL voltage profiles vs specific capacity (bottom) and vs moles of virtually de-inserted Ca 2+ (Δ x) (top) of Ca/0.45 M Ca(BF 4) 2, EC/PC (1:1 vol)/CaTaN 2 (with 15% wt of Super P carbon) cells at 100 °C and C/100 rate and corresponding ex situ XRD patterns (b,c). (D) X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the pristine (a) and chemically oxidized samples are also displayed in (D). (*) denotes reflections corresponding to CaF 2. </caption>
