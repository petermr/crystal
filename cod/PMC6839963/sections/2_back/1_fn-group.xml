  <p id="P20">Each system was optimized to a residual force of 0.005 Å eV
   <sup>−1</sup>. All optimizations for crystal and molecular systems were performed at the 
   <italic>Γ</italic>-point. The molecular systems were put in a cubic unit cell with a side of 25 Å, which ensures no impact due to interactions with periodic images. The results were analyzed and visualized with in-house Python scripts.
