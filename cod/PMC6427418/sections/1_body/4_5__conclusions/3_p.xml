<p>The results presented in this manuscript show that relatively small changes of sizes of selected particles forming nanoinclusions can constitute an efficient method to modify the elastic properties of nanocomposites at high pressures. Even though only hard interactions were considered in the studied system, the obtained results may be useful to researchers in the field of materials engineering and smart materials. The authors hope that some of the results presented here will constitute a source of inspiration for real experiments.</p>
