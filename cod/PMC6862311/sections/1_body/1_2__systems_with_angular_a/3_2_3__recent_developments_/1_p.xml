<p>Our previous discussion of studies of the soft mater systems was focused on a situation when comparably large partially coherent X-ray beams were used. In this case, an illuminated part of the sample is typically much larger than the correlation length and in the scattering experiment we obtain information from the ensemble average at each illuminated spot. The development of the 3rd generation X-ray synchrotron sources opened new possibilities to study soft matter with coherent X-rays. The high degree of coherence of these sources enables interference between the X-rays scattered from different parts of the sample, which results in appearance of strong fluctuations of intensity in the diffraction patterns, i.e., speckles (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f004">Figure 4</xref>). An apparently random ensemble of speckles encodes the instantaneous positions and orientations of the particles in the system. This leads to two different applications; if the system is non-static, then by studies of speckle fluctuations information on dynamics of the system may be obtained [
