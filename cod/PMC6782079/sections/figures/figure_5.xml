  <p>Instrument resolution as a function of the Bragg angle 2θ for a center wavelength of 0.8 Å using the high-resolution guide setting. The steps coincide with the various portions of the instrument and are from the ‘theoretical’ values calculated from the derivative of the Bragg equation. This demonstrates that the detector locations have a continuously varying resolution.</p>
