<p>RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub> has a hydrogen content of 3.4 wt.%. If this material follows the group 1 tendency regarding dehydrogenation reactions, RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub> could reach a 2.5 wt.% of reversible hydrogen storage. Weidenthaler et al. reported the synthesis of RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub> from the metals Al, Rb, and with TiCl
 <sub>3</sub> as an additive; milling was performed in a hydrogen atmosphere (200 bar) [
 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Adkis et al. reported the synthesis of RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub> by the reaction between LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and metallic Rb [
 <xref rid="B177-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Bestide et al. reported the metathesis between LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and rubidium halides that are assisted by triethylaluminum (AlEt
 <sub>3</sub>) in toluene, hexane, and diethyl ether [
 <xref rid="B178-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. A stoichiometric reaction (99% product) was almost obtained in the latter work. This reaction yield was explained by the formation of a complex between the halide salts and the triethylaluminum, i.e., a Ziegler-type complex. RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, and the deuterated species were also produced by the metathesis reaction between NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, or LiAlD
 <sub>4</sub> with RbCl or RbF promoted by ball milling [
 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub> or RbAlD
 <sub>4</sub> were further heated in an autoclave and then purified [
