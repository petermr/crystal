<p>In this study, we applied high refractive index nanoparticle material as a scattering layer on the inner side of the glass substrate of the bottom emission OLED device to enhance light extraction and to improve angular color shift. The nanoparticle scattering layer is located near the emitting layer of the OLED device, compared to previous approaches mentioned above, so it rarely affects the image quality of the OLED display. We demonstrated a practical highly efficient OLED device using the conventional display manufacturing process by implementing the YSZ nanoparticle as the high refractive index scattering layer. We obtained a 38% enhancement of luminance of the OLED device and a white angular dependency (WAD) of 0.005 at 60 degrees from normal direction.</p>
