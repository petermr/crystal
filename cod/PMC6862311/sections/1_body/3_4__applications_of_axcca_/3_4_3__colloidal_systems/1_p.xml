<p>Another important and intensively studied class of soft matter system are colloidal systems, the unique properties of which, such as tunable photonic bandgap and response to external stimuli, make them attractive for many applications [

However, the interpretation of the scattering data from bulk colloidal crystals possessing various defects is usually challenging. Using coherent X-ray diffraction, it was demonstrated that AXCCA is capable to detect rotational symmetry in a local arrangement of colloidal particles even in thick colloidal films [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast to the previously discussed LC systems with the long-range BO order, in which the anisotropy of the diffraction patterns can be often easily identified by the unaided eye, the coherent diffraction patterns from colloids usually consist of the apparently random speckles along the scattering ring. Thus, AXCCA is in many cases a unique technique which allows one to study the local order in colloids [
