<p id="Par36">The polished sample was mounted on an EBSD holder with a 54° tilt respect to the electron beam perpendicular. The holder was installed on a FEI Nova 600 NanoSEM stage and the sample was tilted 16°, to reach a total tilt of 70° respect to the electron beam perpendicular. The microscope was equipped with a Bruker QUANTAX EBSD detector and operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, a beam current of 10 nA, a 40 µm aperture and at a working distance of 12 mm. The detector was positioned in such a way that the smallest distance between the electron-beam focusing point at the specimen surface and the camera was 16.5 mm. All measurements were performed in high vacuum mode. EBSD orientation map was collected with a pattern resolution of 320 × 240 pixels, exposure time of 155 ms, and step size of 25 µm, total measurement time 3.3 h. The raw data were processed using MTEX toolbox in Matlab.</p>
