 <sub>1</sub>-type arsenic crystal are summarized in Extended Data TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. For covalent bonding (strong bonding), the contribution of 
 <italic>pp</italic> hybridization is the largest, and 
 <italic>pd</italic> and 
 <italic>sd</italic> have subsequent contributions. Bonding orbitals retain much of the 
 <italic>p</italic>-like character. Contribution of 
 <italic>sp</italic> hybridization was not observed. For van der Waals bonding (weak bonding), contributions of 
 <italic>sd</italic> and 
 <italic>pd</italic> hybridization are important, and 
 <italic>pp</italic> has subsequent contributions. It is shown that 
 <italic>d</italic>-orbitals contribute greatly in covalent bonds and especially in van der Waals bonds. The 
 <italic>d</italic> electrons are also responsible for cohesion. Absolute values of partial orbital-orbital correlations for anti-bonding are usually larger than those for van der Waals bonding. Bond overlaps are particularly small in the As1-As3 and As2-As4 van der Waals bonds.
