 </sup> Consisting of buckled SnAs honeycomb networks separated by Sr
 <sup>2+</sup> or Na
 <sup>+</sup>, consideration of these compounds and the above materials design criteria inspired us to incorporate a magnetic rare earth element (Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>) between Sn-based layers with a geometry based on triangles to yield both an unconventional electronic band structure and magnetic properties in a single material.
