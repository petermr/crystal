 <caption> Simulated neutron diffuse scattering. a, b Neutron diffuse scattering near the h00 reflections ( h is the horizontal axis) calculated for the refined configuration at 300 K with ( a) all the species and ( b) only the Pb atoms included in the calculations. c X-ray diffuse scattering near the same reflections with all the species included in the calculations. The intensity traces correspond to the k-positions indicated using white/dotted rectangles; the logarithmic intensity scales are the same as indicated in the corresponding color-scale bars. The neutron scattering in ( a) is modulated relative to ( b), featuring different appearance for the asymmetry of the h00 reflections with h = 2 n and h = 2 n + 1. This modulation, which is associated with the correlated oxygen displacements, reproduces the experimental results reported in ref. 18 , even though the present refinements did not include neutron diffuse scattering </caption>
