    "The ground-state α phase of plutonium has an extraordinary 16-atom per cell, monoclinic crystal structure defined by 20 parameters, including the cell dimensions, not dictated by the symmetry. The electronic, magnetic, and elastic properties of this complicated material have been predicted in the past but here we compute its phonon spectra. Employing a density-functional-theory (DFT) model, that is fully relativistic and accounts for orbital-orbital coupling (orbital polarization, OP), we determine the phonon density of states of α-plutonium and find good agreement with inelastic x-ray scattering. The calculated specific heat also compares very favorably with experiment. An analysis of the partial atom-projected phonon spectra suggests that atom type 8, that is located in a more open space of the structure, dominates the intensity at very high phonon frequencies. This feature of the model is essential for a good agreement with the experimental spectra. The satisfactory comparison between theory and experiment for the phonons and specific heat suggests that the DFT (+OP) approach is appropriate and accurate for α-plutonium."
