<p id="Par3">Effective descriptors were designed from numerical fingerprints of structures found in colloidal self-assembly, and were applied to both automatically finding interesting areas on a phase diagram and automatically identifying important parameter groups related to simple/complex local crystal structures. Their study demonstrates the significant potential of ML for automatic classification and discovery of molecular structures.</p>
