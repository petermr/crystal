<p>The system Sr-Al-H presents a richness of chemistry and compounds. Here, we present the most representative characteristics reported for them. Sr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> has a hydrogen content of 5.3 wt%. It was first produced by the reaction between SrH
 <sub>2</sub> and AlH
 <sub>3</sub> by mechanochemical activation in 2000 [
 <xref rid="B228-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. After that, Sr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> was produced by the metathesis reaction between SrCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 2NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, being assisted by mechanical milling [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The decomposition of Sr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> initiated at about 130 °C. Subsequently, a second dehydrogenation step occurred at about 240 °C to achieve a total of 2.1 wt.% of released hydrogen with both reactions (0.8 and 1.3 wt.%, respectively, including the NaCl load) [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. SrAlH
 <sub>5</sub> (4.21 wt.% of total hydrogen content) is proposed as a reaction intermediary of the decomposition of Sr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> [

 <xref rid="B228-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]:
 <disp-formula>2Sr(AlH
  <sub>4</sub>)
  <sub>2</sub> → 2SrAlH
  <sub>5</sub> + 2Al + 3H
  <sub>2</sub> (145–165 °C)
