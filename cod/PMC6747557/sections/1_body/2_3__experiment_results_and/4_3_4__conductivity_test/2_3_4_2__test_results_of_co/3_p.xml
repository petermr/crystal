 <italic>E</italic> coordinate system is gradually increased. Moreover, it can be seen that with the crystallization of polyethylene, the degree gradually increases, and the electric field threshold from the ohmic zone to the non-ohmic zone gradually increases. Many scholars hold that there are many local states in the forbidden band gap of polymers. These local states can trap carriers in materials to form space charges [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to space charge limiting current theory, from the ohmic region to the space charge limiting current region, the transition voltage of the current region corresponds to the electric field strength at which the space charge begins to accumulate. The cause of the above phenomenon may be that the LDPE electrical conduction flow is the largest and the most effective carrier, and that of LLDPE, MDPE and HDPE is decreased in the four materials at the same field strength in the ohmic region. Therefore, LDPE may first start the accumulation of space charge. The field strength corresponding to the turning point in the high field strength region (non-ohmic region), namely, the point B, is gradually increased, and the field strength corresponding to B point is continuously increased as the crystallinity of the polyethylene increases. Many scholars believe that the turning point in the high field strength region (non-ohmic region) may be due to the tunneling effect under the charge filling area or high field strength [
