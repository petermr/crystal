 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(c)</xref> shows the load versus displacement curves for nano-indentation to 500 nm depth in helium-implanted and unimplanted parts of the &lt;001&gt;-oriented tungsten single crystal. The implanted sample is seen to reach ~73% higher load than the unimplanted sample. This substantial increase in hardening may be attributed to both the helium-implantation induced defects, as well as the increase in pile-up, with an associated increase in contact area. These results are reassuringly similar to previously observed helium-induced changes in tunsten
