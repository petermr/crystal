<p>Overall, the present work represents an additional step in multivalent cathode exploration. Indeed, despite the unsuccessful results, ternary nitrides constitute an interesting alternative to oxides, as the electrons compensating multivalent intercalation are donated to a wider band arising from the strong covalent interaction between the N p states and the transition metal ion, which, as inferred from DFT calculations, may result in redox processes and hence lead to high energy densities.</p>
