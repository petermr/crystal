<p id="Par28">In summary, SAROM is a nondestructive quantitative orientation mapping method with a high diffraction-limited spatial resolution, similar to that of confocal Raman microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">37</xref>). It applies to all Raman active inorganic and organic crystalline material. Due to the simultaneous measurement of multiple polarized channels, we have demonstrated fast scanning capabilities: 16 min for the 2D orientation maps of polycrystalline Si (131 × 120 pixels), 46 min for the 2D orientation map of tablet formulation (134 × 134 pixels) and 176 min for the 3D orientation map of polycrystalline sapphire (57 × 56 × 18 pixels). Furthermore, since it is a confocal method, it does not require complex tomographic data reconstruction as in the case of 3D X-ray orientation microscopy

 </sup>. SAROM is applicable to a broad range of problems in 2D materials, polymers, drugs, and biomolecular research. It is useful in mineralogy, geology, semiconductors (solar cells, microelectronic substrates), ceramics (piezo-, magneto-, and ferroelectrics), and superhard materials (abrasives, drilling tools, superhard transparent windows). Moreover, the functionality of SAROM can be extended by combination with e.g., confocal Raman microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, or polarized light microscopy. Further development of SAROM can be expanded into instantaneous polarized Raman mapping similar to wide-field Raman microscopy
