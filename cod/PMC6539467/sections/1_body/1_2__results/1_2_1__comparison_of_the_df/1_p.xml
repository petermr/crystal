<p>The results of painstaking SC measurements of the eigenvalues of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H chemical shielding tensors and their orientations in the crystal frame of maleic and malonic acids [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] served as the reference data against which the performance of the PW DFT calculations was checked. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01731-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the key statistical parameters describing the level of agreement between theory and experiment (the raw values are gathered in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01731">Supplementary Information, Tables SI1 and SI5</xref>). The values of the slope and intercept of the linear relationship between the chemical shielding and chemical shift data are similar for the set of isotropic values and for the principal components of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H tensors. The errors are small for the isotropic chemical shielding/shift, as expected [

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01731-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), while it should be noted that the corresponding measurement uncertainties were estimated to be Â± 0.5 ppm. The linear regression model of the principal elements is graphically presented in
