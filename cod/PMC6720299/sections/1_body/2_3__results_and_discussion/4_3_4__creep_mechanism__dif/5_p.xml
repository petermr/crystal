<p>To deeply explore the diffusion creep mechanism, the vacancy quantity curves corresponding to the models in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f005">Figure 5</xref> were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Plots of the number of vacancies versus time during the creep deformation process are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f007">Figure 7</xref>. For nanocrystalline materials, it is generally considered that the generation of vacancy is one of the main causes underlying the diffusion creep mechanism, owing to the larger volume fraction of grain boundaries in nanocrystalline materials and the higher probability of vacancies at grain boundaries. In this study, point defects such as vacancy were identified using Wignerâ€“Seitz cell method by comparing the defective crystal with a corresponding perfect crystal lattice and distinguishing a vacancy site from non-atom occupying sites.
