<p>The significant luminescence intensity change induced by the mechanochemical reaction of 
 <bold>2</bold> with one mole ratio of Him is responsible for the large Φ
 <sub>em</sub> difference between 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>. During the solvent-free reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> to produce 
 <bold>5</bold>, bright yellow-green luminescence appeared upon grinding (the picture in the middle of 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>). As the Φ
 <sub>em</sub> value of five-coordinate 
 <bold>1</bold> is very small, this observation suggests that coordination of Him at the axial site of 
 <bold>1</bold> gives the six-coordinate complex [ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>Him]
 <sup>2–</sup>. By continuing grinding, a noncoordinating Him molecule is positioned at the site with the N–H···N hydrogen bond to give the weak luminescent complex, 
 <bold>5</bold>. The mechanochemical reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> with 1 mol equiv of Him gave a yellow-green luminescent solid. The X-ray powder diffraction of the solid indicates the existence of 
 <bold>2</bold> along with an unidentified substance. The unidentified complex might be (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>Him] with a crystal system different from that of 
 <bold>2</bold>. When one drop of water was placed on a crystal of 
 <bold>5</bold> under UV irradiation, almost the nonluminescent crystal gradually exhibited yellow-green photoemission as the water spread around the crystal as shown in

 <bold>2</bold> in the crystalline phase. After the microcrystalline sample of 
 <bold>5</bold> being soaked in water for 3.5 h, the IR spectrum and powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the solid changed to those of 
 <bold>2</bold> (

 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sup>+</sup> is 1:2 in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum in CD
 <sub>3</sub>CN (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02749/suppl_file/ao9b02749_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S8</ext-link>). These results suggest that noncoordinating Him is eliminated by soaking the solid in water and three H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules are incorporated to give 
 <bold>2</bold>. When 
 <bold>5</bold> was suspended in 0.7 mL of D
 <sub>2</sub>O, ca. 3% of the complex was dissolved during the reaction; the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of this solution was used to obtain the signal intensity ratio of (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sup>+</sup> to the DSS internal reference. Therefore, the conversion of 
 <bold>5</bold> to 
 <bold>2</bold> may proceed through the process of the dissolution of the complex in water. When the microcrystalline solid of 
 <bold>6</bold> was placed in a small amount of water and the mixture was allowed to stand for 3.5 h, the IR spectrum and powder X-ray diffraction pattern changed to those of 
 <bold>3</bold> (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02749/suppl_file/ao9b02749_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figures S1 and S9</ext-link>). Therefore, elimination of the noncoordinating Mim molecule in 
 <bold>6</bold> proceeds by exposure of water to give 
 <bold>3</bold>, although the intense luminescence remains through the reaction because the Φ
 <sub>em</sub> values of 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> are similar to each other.
