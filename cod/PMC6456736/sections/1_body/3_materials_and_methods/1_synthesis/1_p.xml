 <sub>3</sub> (99.99%, Aladdin) were homogeneously mixed and ground with ethanol for half an hour. The mixtures were first sintered at 550 °C for 5 h in air and then sintered three times at 750 °C for 4 h under a reducing atmosphere of N

 <sub>2</sub> (10%) in a tube furnace. The obtained samples were cooled to RT and were reground into fine powders for further characterization.
