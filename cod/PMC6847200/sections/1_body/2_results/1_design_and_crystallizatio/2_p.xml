<p>The 
 <italic>env23</italic> and 
 <italic>env1</italic> RNAs in complex with 2′-dG were screened for diffraction quality crystals using a strategy similar to that of the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> aptamer-hypoxanthine complex (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). For each, a series of RNAs was created whose P1 helix lengths varied between 5 and 8 bp, with all variants having a single 3′-adenosine overhang. Initial screening yielded crystals of the 
 <italic>env1</italic> RNA, but were found to be irreproducible. Analysis of the length of RNA in the crystals and that remaining in solution using denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that RNA in crystals were slightly longer than the non-crystallizing RNA remaining in the mother liquor, suggesting a nontemplated 3′-nucleotide was added by T7 RNA polymerase (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We subsequently screened an additional set of single nucleotide additions to the 3′-end of 
 <italic>env1</italic> using transcription templates that have two 2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-methoxy groups at the 3′-end to prevent nontemplated nucleotide addition (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and found that a guanosine added to the 3′-end resulted in reproducible crystals, while addition of an adenosine or uridine did not. Subsequent analysis of the lattice contacts in the 
 <italic>env1</italic> crystal structure revealed that the Watson–Crick face of the 3′ guanosine forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the β-phosphate of the 5′-residue of a neighboring molecule. It should be noted that a similar strategy was used to obtain reproducible crystals of the SAM-I/IV riboswitch aptamer domain (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
