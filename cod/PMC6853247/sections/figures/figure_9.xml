  <p>(a) Superimposition of the diffraction patterns acquired on the anhydrous phase B (Anh‐B) lamella (colored in black) and in olivine 2, near the lamella (colored in red). The exact locations are shown in (b). A precession angle of 3° has been applied to the electron beam to get quasi‐kinematic conditions. A superstructure can be noted between the [100]
   <sub>ol</sub> direction of olivine and the [010]
   <sub>Anh‐B</sub> direction of Anh‐B (
   <inline-formula>3 × 0.48 nm ≈ 1.43 nm</inline-formula>); and a correspondence is observed between the [010]
   <sub>ol</sub> direction of olivine and the [001]
   <sub>Anh‐B</sub> direction of Anh‐B. (b) Transmission electron microscopy bright‐field corresponding to the acquisition of the diffraction patterns of (a). The interface between the lamella and olivine 2 is edge‐on and located between the arrows. It corresponds to (100)
   <sub>ol</sub> plane in olivine and (010)
   <sub>Anh</sub>
   <sub>‐</sub>
   <sub>B</sub> in Anh‐B. The circles (250 nm in diameter) represent the position of the selected‐area aperture for acquisition of the diffraction patterns of (a).
