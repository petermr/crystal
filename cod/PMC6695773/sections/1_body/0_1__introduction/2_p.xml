<p>According to the Ti–Sn equilibrium diagram [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn melts congruently at 1943 K, and it remains stable down to room temperature without undergoing any phase transformations. The intermetallics has the ordered hexagonal D0
 <sub>19</sub> crystal structure with a space group of P6
 <sub>3</sub>/mmc (No. 194) and the lattice parameters of a = 5.916 ± 0.004 Å and c = 4.764 ± 0.004 Å [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Colin McCullough et al. in 1993 studied the phase selection in undercooled Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn melts, and reported two previously unknown metastable forms of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn: base-centered orthorhombic structure (space group: C
 <sub>mmm</sub>) with the lattice parameters of a = 9.76 Å, b = 6.18 Å and c = 4.75 Å in the sample with supercoolings of 109 K and 311 K; monoclinic structure with the lattice parameters of a = 5.72 Å, b = 4.74 Å, c = 6.05 Å and β = 79.5° in the sample with supercoolings of 258 K [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ivanova, et al. has reported a reversible group-subgroup transformation between D0
 <sub>19</sub> phase and new orthorhombic phase of non-stoichiometric Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn (Ti
 <sub>75.5</sub>Sn
 <sub>24.5</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, no new equilibrium structure of stoichiometric Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn has been reported. Even though the existence of equilibrium phase transformation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn has been discovered indirectly from its DMA results in [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], there are no direct experimental data about it, and the characteristics of transformation and crystal structure of new phase still remain unknown.
