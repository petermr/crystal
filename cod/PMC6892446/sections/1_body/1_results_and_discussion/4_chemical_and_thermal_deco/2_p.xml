<p>Chemical decomposition was studied by exposing crystals of the three oxohydroxoferrates, which were placed on the same SEM sample holder, to air for 1 minute and after the first SEM measurement for another 5 minutes. SEM images of crystals of

  <bold>Rb</bold>

  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic> show tarnishing (Figure S17 and S18, Supporting Information). After the second air exposure, the SEM images of the decomposition of crystals of all three hydroxoferrates in the 5 min experiment are similar. They show clubs and blisters on the surface, but also long fibers, which have a notably higher alkali metal content.
