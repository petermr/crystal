<p>The approximate lattice parameters and atomic coordinates of the η″ phase with the space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2
 <italic>/m</italic> (i.e. the motif structure without modulation) are derived based on those of the parent η phase [
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>] (left part of 
 <xref rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>), and tabulated in the right part of 
 <xref rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. Each of the Fe, Al1, Al2, and Al3 sites in the η phase with the space group 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> splits into a few different Wyckoff sites in the η″ phase with the space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2
