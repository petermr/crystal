<p>The research study on montmorillonite using molecular simulation technology began in the 1990s. Skipper et al. first used Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods to simulate the interlayer water of Mg-based montmorillonite (Mg-MMT), and obtained the interlayer spacing of Mg-MMT under different water content conditions [

 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. When the simulation reached equilibrium, the layer spacing of Mg-MMT was 14.7 ± 0.1 Å, which was very close to the actual measured value of 15.1 Å by XRD (X-Ray Diffraction analysis) [

In view of the phenomenon that the interlayer height of Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) increased with the increasing of water content, the interlayer spacing of Na-MMT with different water content was simulated, and the simulation results were very consistent with the XRD data. Mary et al. used the Monte Carlo method and the molecular dynamics method to study the Na-MMT and Cs-MMT, and compared the structure and dynamics characteristics with the experimental data, the results showed that the calculated layer distance and the diffusion coefficient of water molecules in single hydrate and interlayer cations were basically identical by the experimental data [
