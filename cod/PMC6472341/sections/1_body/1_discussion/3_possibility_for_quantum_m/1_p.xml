<p id="Par17">Several kinds of “organic superconductors” and “synthetic metals” were made by combining organic compounds or organic compounds with inorganic ions. Most were structures in which positively and negatively charged layers were stacked separately. The charge transfer complex called TTF:TCNQ with a column structure of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) portions is known as a synthetic highly conductive donor-acceptor complex

 <sub>1</sub>-As structure seems to be of some importance. Total charges are clearly divided into positive and negative in the same elements for the grey-As and black-As portions and the sequence in which one-dimensional electron donor and electron acceptor rods (parts) alternate in the layer is the first description. The ability to design chemical bonding and atomic arrangement within layers should open up further possibilities for the creation of new devices. Several phases of group-V elements show superconductivity as quantum physical properties
