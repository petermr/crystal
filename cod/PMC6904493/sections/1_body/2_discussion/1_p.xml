<p id="Par13">The monoclinic structure that defines the α phase of plutonium is quite remarkable. Not only is it without comparison, but the large monoclinic cell has sites that are very different from each other. Most glaring is the site for the 8
 <sup>th</sup> atom (Zachariasen and Ellinger’s ordering
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>) that is located in a more open space than the other types, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Consequently, the local electronic structure is significantly different between the atom types and particularly so for atom number 8. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> we show our calculated atom-projected electronic density of states

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, and focusing on the features at the Fermi level, it is clear that this atom is different than all the others. One may hypothesize that the phonon properties are affected anomalously due to the contribution from this prominent 8
 <sup>th</sup> atom.
