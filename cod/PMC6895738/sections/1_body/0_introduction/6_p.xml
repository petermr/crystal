 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which are presumedly due to the interaction of atmospheric water with ceramics. To prove the stated assumption the studies of four compositions corresponding to the different areas of the phase diagram have been performed in the present work. A plausible mechanism of water-solid interaction in PLS has been discussed.
