<p id="Par61">In the Monte Carlo simulation, we did not simulate the non-uniformity of the detector responses, which in reality can add to the image noise. This means, in the real scanner, the proper normalization is essential to improve the uniformity even in the case of block implementation. Additional studies can be performed to assess the block model with real data acquired from different scanner designs such as the SAFIR scanner.</p>
