Those spectra exhibit apparent biexponential decay with fast and slow components, which are related to the two robust room-temperature excitons (see fig. S7) due to their large exciton binding energy up to ~200 meV (

However, using a simple biexponential fitting, the average lifetime including all radiative and nonradiative components can be qualitatively analyzed. Both decay times of the biexponential decay markedly decrease with increasing pressure. At a pressure greater than 3.5 GPa, the trPL intensity largely drops, synchronizing with the sharp decline of the steady-state PL in
