<p>To prevent particle agglomeration, the reaction of Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S nanocrystals with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP was also performed under milder reaction conditions. This reaction was performed at half the scale of the reactions discussed above, inside a N
 <sub>2</sub>-filled glovebox. To this end, 0.1 mmol (0.210 mL) GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, 0.860 mL of toluene, and 0.025 mL of OLAM were placed in a vial. The mixture was heated to 50 °C, under constant stirring at 400 rpm. Once the desired temperature was reached, 0.250 mL of parent NC dispersion (equivalent to approximately 5 mg of parent particles) was swiftly injected. The reaction was stopped by removing the vial from the heater and quenched by the addition of methanol and butanol as nonsolvents. The product was washed twice prior to analysis, by addition of methanol and butanol as nonsolvent, centrifugation, and removal of the supernatant. Finally, the particles were redispersed in toluene.
