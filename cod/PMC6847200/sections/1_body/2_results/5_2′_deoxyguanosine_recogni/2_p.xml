<p>An unusual feature of the 2′-dG-II class relative to other classes in the purine family is the presence of a G21–C79 Watson–Crick base pair in P1 proximal to the three-way junction rather than an A–U pair. While an A–U pair is nearly universally conserved at this position, a G–C pair is observed in a few guanine and adenine riboswitches (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and an A–U to G–C mutation is well tolerated by the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> riboswitch (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In 
 <italic>env1</italic>, this base pair is directly involved in ligand recognition through interactions between N2 of G21 and N4 of C50 hydrogen bonding with the deoxyribose furan oxygen (O4′) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). This is an additional hydrogen bonding interaction over that observed in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I), in which only the exocyclic amine of C57 (equivalent of C50 in 
 <italic>env1</italic>) interacts with O4′ of 2′-deoxyguanosine. This additional interaction substantially contributes to 
 <italic>env1</italic>′s higher affinity for 2′-dG than 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA since a G21A–C79U mutation in 
 <italic>env1</italic> binds 2′-dG with 16.9 times lower affinity than wild type (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
