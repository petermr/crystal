<p id="p0660">The aforementioned singular dynamics arises, for example, in the process of transitions between the adiabatic ground and first excited states of molecules, as a result of “an attempt by light electrons to reorganize the structure of a very heavy nuclear subsystem only within the framework of quantum mechanics”, so that the structure of the nuclear subsystem would adapt to a new electron charge distribution in an excited adiabatic (or nearly adiabatic) state. The presence of a singularity in the rates of quantum transitions in molecular quantum mechanics is also indicated by the internal inconsistency of the Franсk-Condon principle, which was discussed above in Section 
 <xref rid="sec2.5" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref> and which is associated with the inability to give a mathematical description of the qualitative, and essentially quantum-classical, Franck-Condon picture of the dynamics of a molecular transient state. Therefore, in theoretical physics, the discussed singularity must be damped, which was done by the author on the simplest example of elementary electron transfers in condensed matter [

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] by introducing chaos (dozy chaos) into the quantum dynamics of the transient state. However, as a result of such damping by introducing chaos, the energy spectrum of moving electrons and nuclei in the transient state becomes continuous [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This means that the proposed new dynamic theory is no longer quantum mechanics, but quantum-classical mechanics. Quantum states are the initial and final states in the adiabatic approximation, which are quite sharply different in the electron-nuclear structure, and the transient state is similar to the classical state. The discovery of a new dynamic theory — quantum-classical mechanics, means the discovery in physics of a new fundamental property of an electron. This property appears in an electron as a result of its binding of atomic nuclei into molecular systems and consists in its ability to provoke the necessary chaos in the transient dynamic state of these systems. This new property of an electron makes it possible to eliminate the discussed singularity in the quantum mechanics of molecules and, as a result, to ensure the very possibility of “quantum” transitions in molecular systems. Thus, an electron, being exclusively a quantum microparticle in atoms, where it makes quantum jumps between discrete energy levels, in molecules and condensed matter it becomes a quantum-classical microparticle with a continuous spectrum of energy in the transient state [
