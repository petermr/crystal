<p id="p0735">As for dozy chaos, in the case of classical mechanics it simply ceases to exist, since in this case molecular quantum transitions, the dynamics of which dozy chaos determines only, cease to exist. Hence, dozy chaos, which provides a classical character of any transient state in molecular quantum transitions, is a purely quantum phenomenon in physical nature, in the sense that it does not exist by definition, in contrast to quantum chaos originating from classical chaos, in the field of classical phenomena. Such a dualistic nature of dozy chaos — its existence only in the field of quantum phenomena and the functional role being in providing, due to chaos, a classical character of any transient state in molecular quantum transitions — is a generalization (in the case of energy
