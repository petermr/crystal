<p id="Par12">The total energy change after jog-pair formation (or, alternatively, vacancy dissociation) varies from site to site, ranging between −0.89 eV and 0.09 eV. This is denoted by “energy change” in Table

 <sub>0</sub>, which is the energy difference between a dissociated vacancy configuration and the lowest energy among the localized vacancy configurations, after the jog formation at different sites are fairly close to each other, 0.03–0.18 eV higher. Given the small energy penalty in the jog formation, it is suggested that the jog formation events in the MD simulations are driven by entropy, not by a reduction in enthalpy. Further, the small energy difference indicates that the dislocation jogs formed at different sites are similar to each other. There are two possible reasons contributing to this small difference: one is due to the different atomic sites, and the other is due to different segment lengths between the jogs. We will see later that the latter factor is a rather weak one. The entropy contributions due to the jog formation, neither configurational nor vibrational, have been directly computed.
