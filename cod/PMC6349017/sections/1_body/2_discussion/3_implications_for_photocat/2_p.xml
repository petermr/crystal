 <xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the present study, we have shown that proton conduction on ZnO(101[combining macron]0) is pseudo-one-dimensional, whereas it is two-dimensional at ZnO(112[combining macron]0). This opens up interesting opportunities for the design of advanced ZnO-based nanomaterials in which such facet-dependent proton transport dimensionalities can be exploited. For example, our results would indicate that ZnO(112[combining macron]0), where proton diffusion is two-dimensional and comparatively fast, would allow for efficient, almost isotropic, proton diffusion from the place of the formation to the place of the reaction. In contrast, at ZnO(101[combining macron]0), the formation and reaction must take place at the same “coordinate” along the polar direction, thus limiting the probability that two reactants can meet to form the product. These results are particularly interesting in light of the fact that ZnO(101[combining macron]0) is a more stable surface than ZnO(112[combining macron]0).
