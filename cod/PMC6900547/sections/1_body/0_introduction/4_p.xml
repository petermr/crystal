<p>This study examines the effect of typical brine components on the precipitation of zabuyelite. Precipitates were formed by mixing carbonate-bearing and Li-bearing solutions

 </sup> Interactions between different ions in solution were examined in situ using Raman spectroscopy and compared with predictions from thermodynamic solution speciation calculations. In contrast, direct interaction between different ions in solution and the solid zabuyelite phase were examined in situ using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Potential changes in crystal morphology due to ionâ€“solid interactions observed in electron microscopy images were verified using atomistic simulations. The experiments and simulations demonstrate that K
 <sup>+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> have minimal direct influence on the growth of zabuyelite. However, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> outcompete Li
 <sup>+</sup> for carbonate-phase growth, whereas there is evidence that sulfate directly interacts with the zabuyelite crystals during growth.
