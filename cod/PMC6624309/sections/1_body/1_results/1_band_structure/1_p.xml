<p id="Par5">We propose a structure of 2D 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric PCs, which is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a).</xref> The system is arranged alternately with two types of cylindrical rods with conjugate complex modulus, one of which is the gain, and the other is the loss. The longitudinal wave velocity of the gain (loss) materials has a positive (negative) imaginary part. Here, we use 
 <italic>α</italic> to denote the imaginary strength of the gain/loss materials. The distribution in the x direction with balanced gain and loss satisfies the 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry condition that the real part of the modulus is an even function, while the imaginary part is odd. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref> shows the diagram of the super cell marked as green in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a),</xref> which contains 2 × 1 unit cells with lattice constant 
 <italic>a</italic> and a rod radius of 0.3
 <italic>a</italic>. The band structures of the underlying 2D Hermitian system and non-Hermitian system are calculated, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(c)</xref> shows the band structure of common PCs with only the real component (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0). The wave vectors sweep along the boundary of the irreducible Brillouin zone for rectangular lattice. Although the 2 × 1 super cell method was used, the calculation result is identical to that of the unit cell, except a band corresponding to the unit cell is folded into two bands in the x direction of the super cell. Some bands also cross and degenerate in the Brillouin zone. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d)</xref>, thresholdless 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry breaking spontaneously occurs when the imaginary component (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.25) is added to form a balanced complex elastic modulus. Many degenerated bands appear along the boundary, especially in the Γ-X and Y-M directions. Similar to the case for 1D structures, some bands merge at the high symmetry points (labeled as dashed box A). However, in dashed box B, the originally degenerated bands split and merge again with other multiple bands, which does not occur in low-dimensional situations. The compression of merged bands also causes the appearance of directional bandgaps.
