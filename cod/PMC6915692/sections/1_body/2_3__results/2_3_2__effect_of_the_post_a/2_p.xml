<p>The patterns show that, for powders annealed between 100 and 300 °C, the crystalline structure remains the same as the raw blue powder (with very low crystallinity, which corresponds to cubic-type phase) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The crystal structure changes from Pm-3m pseudo-cubic group to P2
 <sub>1</sub>/n monoclinic group when a post-annealing treatment over 400 °C is applied. However, the particles after annealing at 400 °C are significantly less crystallized than those annealed at 600 °C, since the peak widths of the pattern of the compound obtained at a low temperature are about two times larger than those obtained after annealing at 600 °C.
