<p id="Par31">In summary, this machine learning process has revealed the mechanism that the material underwent along annealing only based on the topological attributes generated from the available configurations of the system. This is a remarkable success of domain-based data analytics that opens up the possibility for analyzing the ever increasing number of simulation configurations that are becoming available to the condensed matter community.</p>
