<p>Here we demonstrate that structure refinement can be performed from processing three‐dimensional precession electron diffraction data acquired on sample volumes smaller than 0.005 μm
 <sup>3</sup> of a high‐pressure phase. The technique produces a structure model, which is compatible with the chemical composition measured in the TEM by EDS and for which the presence of six‐coordinated silicon has been confirmed by EELS analyses.
