<p>Selected area electron diffraction was carried out by using a JEOL 1210 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV, equipped with a Gatan double tilt sample holder, with typically 20 crystals being examined per sample. The powder samples were finely dispersed in ACN and deposited as droplets on carbon-coated films supported on copper grids.</p>
