<p id="Par9">Interestingly, if the reductive potential is removed from an activated electrode (e.g., if the reductive potential cycling is ceased), even if only for a few seconds, then the overpotential for hydrogen evolution is found to revert back to essentially its original value (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>). However, enhanced activity can be restored by simply re-applying a cathodic bias or by reductive potential cycling, both of which produce re-activation of the material on the same timescales as that seen with pristine material. This suggested to us that the cause of the enhanced activity was likely to be electronic in nature, rather than related to irreversible (or slow) changes in the structure or morphology of the catalyst (see below for this analysis). In support of this hypothesis, comparison with nanocrystalline 2H-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> shows no improvement in the overpotential after 100 reductive potential cycles (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>), further suggesting that the origin of the activation process of 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> is electronic in nature.
