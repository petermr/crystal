<p id="Par4">The question is then how to harness the extraordinary thermomigration at the nanoscale. The fast shape change can be both harmful and useful depending on the context. For integrated circuits, thermomigration has been considered as a threat to structural reliability of nanoscale interconnects

 </sup> with occasional temperature gradient typically &lt;1000 °C cm

 </sup>, except with surface thermomigration one has a 2D liquid layer—the surface pre-melting layer covering the solid reservoir—instead of a 3D liquid bath beneath. Also, unlike displacive deformation, after diffusive deformation the material usually remains a clean crystal with defect-free interior, making it a more desirable way of nanoscale reshaping.
