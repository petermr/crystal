<p>The condition for this temporal coincidence is that the ToF τ of the undesired signal is shorter (or longer) than that of the true photoelectrons by one period 
 <italic>T</italic> or a multiple 
 <italic>nT</italic> of the exciting photon pulses. Since the clock of the DLD is started at each photon pulse, this undesired signal appears in the same time interval as the photoelectrons from first order. We have simulated the systematic behavior of this 
 <italic>temporal aliasing effect</italic> (briefly 
 <italic>nT-effect</italic>) for the present geometry and three drift energies typical for HAXPES. Fig. 4(
 <italic>f</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref> shows the results for a large energy range from 5 eV to 20 keV and for the case of 80-bunch filling of PETRA III (pulse period 
 <italic>T</italic> = 96 ns). The scheme shows the relevant cases between Δ
 <italic>t</italic> = −2
 <italic>T</italic> and +2
 <italic>T</italic>. For 40-bunch filling (
 <italic>T</italic> = 192 ns) the +
 <italic>T</italic> and −
 <italic>T</italic> intervals are missing, making the situation less complex.
