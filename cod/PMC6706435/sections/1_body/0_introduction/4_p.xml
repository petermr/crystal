 </sup>. Also, the relations between the duration of the reaction zone, the critical diameter, and the shock-wave sensitivity were discussed. The last parameter is important first of all for practical purposes: the miniaturization of explosion devices expands the sphere of HE applications and increases the safety degree due to the decrease of the amount of HE necessary for the steady detonation. The prediction of shock-wave sensitivity for different grain size of HE is an actual research topic which can be emphasized by the increase of the number of related publications in recent years

 </sup>. At present, the simulations of the transition from a shock-wave impact to the detonation are performed using the empirical kinetics. The knowledge of the characteristics of the reaction zone, in particular, its duration, will allow one to carry out simulation at the qualitatively new level.
