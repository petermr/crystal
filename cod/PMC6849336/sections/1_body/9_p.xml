<p>Initial electroluminescence tests had been conducted on Cl-free samples (CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs) in order to benchmark the utility of the new synthesis and compare to the extensive prior art on CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NC LEDs. The best LED characteristics were attained when using 15 nm layers of B3PYMPM (4,6-bis(3,5-di(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine) or 3TPYMB (3,3′,3″-[borylidynetris(2,4,6-trimethyl-3,1-phenylene)]tris[pyridine]) as hole-blocking layers (HBLs), in combination with a 45 nm layer of TPBi (1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene) as an electron transporting layer (ETL) and pTPD (poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bisphenylbenzidine]) as a hole-transporting layer (HTL).

The best-efficiency devices were those employing a 15 nm layer of B3PYMPM as an HBL and a 45 nm layer of TPBi as an ETL. These devices presumably benefit from hole localization in the emissive layer and from the additional barrier for the electron injection (at TPBi), thereby balancing the barrier existing for the injection of holes. This device architecture, together with the judicious optimization of the NC purification (the choice of solvents and nonsolvents and their amounts, as well as number of purification steps etc.), yielded a champion green device, with characteristics shown in

 </xref>. Specifically, the EL peak centered at 515 nm was characterized by EQE values of up to 9.8%. High EQE values are satisfactorily retained at higher current densities, allowing for obtaining brightness of 34 700 Cd/m

 <sub>3</sub> NCs with DDAB treatment have presented EQE values of 7–9.7% and brightness of 2269–15000 Cd/m
