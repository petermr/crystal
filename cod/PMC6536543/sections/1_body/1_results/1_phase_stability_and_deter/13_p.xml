<p id="Par18">Tilleyite was also studied at high-pressure high-temperature. The sample was progressively compressed and heated up to 7.2 GPa and 402 °C while characterized collecting 
 <italic>in situ</italic> powder XRD data. The HP-HT patterns were indexed using the isolated single reflections and confirmed that the tilleyite structure remained stable in that P-T range (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> of SI). Due to the fact that the pressure is not constant during heating, we used a perturbational method to estimate the thermal expansivity at low pressures, as described in ref.

 </sup>. This approximation has been successfully used to calculate the thermal expansivity under compression in other compounds

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. A linear fit to our data yields a volumetric thermal expansion value of 3.5(4)·10

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> of SI). The thermal expansivity of tilleyite lies between those of CaCO

 <sub>3</sub> calcite (2.01·10
 <sup>−5</sup> K

 <sup>−5</sup> K

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>

 <sup>−5</sup> K

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. CaSiO
 <sub>3</sub> wollastonite, another end-member calcium silicate, exhibits a smaller thermal expansion (5.7–7·10
 <sup>−6</sup> K

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. This fact suggests therefore that the thermal expansivity of Ca

 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> tilleyite (2CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> + Ca
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>4 + </sub>CaSiO
 <sub>3</sub> stoichiometric content) is a consequence of the structural homologies in the atomic arrangements with other members of the Ca-Si-C-O system.
