<p>The research group of Prof. Q. Wang performed a complete study regarding the determination of the (
 <italic>p</italic>, T) equilibrium of reaction (88) with and without TiF
 <sub>4</sub> as a catalyst (

 <xref rid="B274-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>,
 <xref rid="B285-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. The results indicate that the catalyst moves to higher pressure the equilibrium towards Na
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> formation at a given temperature; or conversely a reduction of the equilibrium temperature at a given pressure. Fonneløp et al. revealed that the addition of 10 mol% of TiF
 <sub>3</sub> to Na
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> induced hydrogen release at temperatures as low as 50 °C [
 <xref rid="B281-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>]. In such a case, the dehydrogenation pathway changes from a one-step process (Equation (88)) to a two-step process, with the formation of Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub> as the intermediary. Between 50–180 °C, the decomposition reaction was described as:
 <disp-formula>Na
  <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
  <sub>6</sub> → 2/3 Na
  <sub>3</sub>AlH
  <sub>6</sub> + LiH + 1/3 Al + 1/2 H
  <sub>2</sub>.
