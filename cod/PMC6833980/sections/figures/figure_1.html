 <caption> Schematic illustrations of the beam trajectories in a plane-parallel crystal. ( a) Beam trajectories in an unbent crystal. P 0 represents the incident wave on the surface, P h the diffracted wave and P t the transmitted wave. ( b) Beam trajectories in a bent crystal when the X-ray is incident on the expanded surface due to bending (β &gt; 0). S′ 1 represents the beam touching the back surface at B 1 and S 3 the beam reflected from the entrance surface after reflection from the back surface. ( c) The variation range of the tie point on the dispersion surface for mirage beams. d 1 on branch (1) is the tie point at the incident point and d 2 on branch (2) is that at the emitted point. L o is the Lorentz point and G the Bragg gap. The distance from the incident point of the X-ray (A 0) to the edge of the crystal is . </caption>
