<p id="Par21">The meaning of the product 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> ⋅ 
 <italic>τ</italic> is an estimate proportional to the conduction 
 <italic>G</italic> in the region of high conductivity. The conduction is related to the resistance 
 <italic>R</italic> as 
 <italic>G</italic> = 1/
 <italic>R</italic>. From the experimental point of view, the hyperbolic dependence 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>τ</italic>) can be explained by the presence of inhomogeneities in the charge structure, which are negligible only for a single crystal.
