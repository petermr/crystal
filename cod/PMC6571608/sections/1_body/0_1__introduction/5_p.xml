<p>Nowadays, a new type of displays for augment reality (AR) technologies, head mounted displays, and other types of see-through displays are rapidly developing [

 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00861" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00861" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It was shown (for example in Reference [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00861" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), that it is possible to create multi-plane switchable display on the base of liquid crystal-photopolymer composite materials. Due to the wide range of possible applications of such products and due to complicated structure of them, it is extremely important to develop the theoretical model, taking into account the most complete set of possible effects that determine the key characteristics of the designed devices.
