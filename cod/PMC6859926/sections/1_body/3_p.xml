<p>The aforementioned natural compounds also inhibit PPP1C and PPP5C, with fostriecin representing the only compound with marked selectivity for PP2AC. Another point to consider is that PP2AC represents a catalytic subunit that is shared with at least 18 different PPP2A holoenzymes. Thus, the existing data are consistent with the concept that the simultaneous suppression of several PPP-family phosphatases, which are essential regulators of cell cycle progression, the DNA damage response (DDR), numerous checkpoint control mechanisms and mitosis, may collectively generate antitumor activity. For example PPP1- and PPP2-holoenzymes have been implicated in complex crosstalk, acting to counter the activity of key kinetochore associated kinases (

Notably, the activity of these PPPases have been linked to the regulation of centromeric cohesion, mitotic spindle assembly, and numerous phosphorylation dependent mechanisms and processes that are under the surveillance of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) [

Several studies have shown that suppressing the activity or expression of PPP1, PPP2A, PPP4, PPP5, or PPP6 elicit cell cycle arrest and ultimately apoptosis from mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, during the DDR, PPP1, PPP2A, and PPP5 inhibition have been linked to mechanisms that trigger growth arrest or induce apoptosis.
