<p>Modulated structures are ubiquitous among a great variety of materials like metallic alloys, inorganic, organic and metal–organic compounds, ceramics or minerals (Arakcheeva &amp; Chapuis, 2006

Although ordered, the lack of periodicity or the presence of very long spatial periods convert them into systems that require a large number of structural parameters for their description. In the case of strictly aperiodic materials this number becomes infinite. The superspace formalism alleviates this shortcoming, ordering hierarchically by importance the structural details through a moderate and relevant set of symmetry-independent atomic parameters (Van Smaalen, 2004
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb80"> ▸</xref>). Hence, superspace symmetry reveals itself as the most powerful tool for solving, refining and describing modulated structures. Nevertheless, the atomic interactions on which the first-principles calculations are based have not yet been formulated in superspace and initial ideas on ‘superspace DFT’ were not successful (Perez-Mato, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb58"> ▸</xref>). Therefore, a lot of valuable structural information could remain hidden when first-principles calculations are applied to these kind of materials.
