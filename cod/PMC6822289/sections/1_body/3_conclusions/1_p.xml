<p>We presented a systematic way to optimize the structures of covalentâ€“organic frameworks (COFs) using density functional theory. In addition, we have assessed their performance for CO
 <sub>2</sub> capture as estimated from classical simulations. The optimization revealed some substantial changes, mainly in the layers rearrangement of these materials, and finally provided a set of frameworks that have been obtained from a consistent and reproducible protocol. The Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA) has been used to achieve the result, and this set of 308 CURATED DFT-optimized COFs is made available, with optimized structure and high-quality partial charges, for further computational investigations. The acronym stands for 
 <italic>Clean, Uniform, and Refined with Automatic Tracking from Experimental Database</italic>. We plan to extend our CURATED set of COFs periodically with the most recently reported frameworks. It can serve as a reference for consulting and for molecular simulations.
