 <p>The neutron powder diffractometer POWGEN at the Spallation Neutron Source has recently (2017–2018) undergone an upgrade which resulted in an increased detector complement along with a full overhaul of the structural design of the instrument. The current instrument has a solid angular coverage of 1.2 steradians and maintains the original third-generation concept, providing a single-histogram data set over a wide 
  <italic>d</italic>-spacing range and high resolution to access large unit cells, detailed structural refinements and

  <italic>operando</italic> measurements.
