 </sup>. The key spectral features of the parent CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs, such as the sharp optical absorption edge and well-defined absorption peaks are maintained even after the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>). The absorption peak of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> observed at ∼394 nm is blue-shifted to ∼388 nm and that of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> is shifted from ∼485 nm to ∼480 nm. The corresponding absorption peak was examined to estimate the optical bandgap of the different composite of NCs. The bandgap of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-</sub>xBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs is tuned from 3.144 eV to 3.194 eV and 2.557 eV to 2.578 eV, respectively. The increase in bandgap is most likely due to the increasing electronegativity (χ) of the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions (χ ∼1.7) occupying the B-site in the ABX
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite structure compared to the Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> ions (χ ∼1.6), which reduces the dimensions for both the crystal lattice and the NC and is in agreement with the XRD and TEM analyses

 </sup>. Furthermore, all the samples prepared with various Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> content exhibit identical and broadband excitation spectra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e,f</xref>). The excitation spectra are measured by monitoring the corresponding peak emission wavelength. The broad spectral band suggests that these perovskite materials can be effectively excited at a broad range of wavelengths. The excitation spectrum is at a higher energy region compared to the corresponding emission energy spectrum that reflects the potential applications of these materials in conjunction with III-nitride based UV/blue LEDs to obtain white light through photon down-conversion. The dual spectral bands shown in the excitation spectra are related to a charge-separated bandgap state (at higher wavelength) and the charge transfer band (at lower wavelength)

 </sup>. Furthermore, the observed linear relationship between the PL energy and the lattice vector (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>) for the NCs with the different incorporated amounts of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> signifies that the effect of lattice contraction is dominant factors in altering the observed optical behavior of the as-synthesized NCs. In brief, the lattice contraction favors the stronger interactions between ‘B’ and ‘X’, which induces the antibonding combinations between Pb(6p) and Br(4p) resulting in a shift of the conduction band minimum to higher energies and, hence the bandgap of NCs increases

 <sub>3</sub> NCs (with tunable blue-shifted PL emission) that were obtained by other compositional control

 </sup>. Moreover, the as-grown NCs exhibit the high PLQYs as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The PLQY of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> NCs at 0% Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is 19% and that at 15% Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is 16%. Similarly, PLQY of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs at 0% Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is 93% and that at 15% Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is 92%. The PLQY of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> NCs is reduced by a higher value in comparison to CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs. The halide vacancies and Cs vacancies are the dominant defect states for CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite NCs. At the highest content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> doping, the formation energy corresponding to these vacancies in the Cl-based NCs might have decreased by a larger amount in comparison to the Br-based NCs. Eventually, this results in an increase in the structural defects leading to a higher decrease in PLQY of the Cl-based NCs

 </sup>. This demonstrates that Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> has an impact on absolute PLQYs of alloyed NCs suggesting that the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> altered the defect states of the host NCs.
