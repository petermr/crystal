<p id="Par4">One possible recipe would be to select materials that contain structural elements capable of generating the required electronic structure, focusing on magnetic systems with a center of inversion. The most simple and well-known generator of the Dirac-like massless relativistic dispersions is the 2D network of Bi atoms. These layers should be then separated by other blocks containing magnetic ions to break the time-reversal symmetry (TRS). To ensure direct spectroscopic observation of the Weyl state by angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) one would choose to stay close to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to avoid strongly magnetized domains which would influence the photoelectrons. This role could be perfectly played by manganese atoms, which tend to order antiferromagnetically. Finally, in order to avoid a perfect AFM, which formally breaks TRS but does not lift the degeneracy, strongly magnetic ions of rare earth elements should be introduced to the lattice as well.</p>
