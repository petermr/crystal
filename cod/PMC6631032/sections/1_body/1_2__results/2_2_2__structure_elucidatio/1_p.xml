<p>Veronimide (
 <bold>2</bold>) was isolated as an amorphous solid that presented high-resolution ESI-MS mass signals ([M+Na]

 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 249.1211 corresponding to the molecular formula C
 <sub>11</sub>H
 <sub>18</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>Na and 4 degrees of unsaturation. In the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), 
 <bold>2</bold> presented, among others, protons attributed to an amide (8.26 ppm), a formyl (8.03 ppm), a down field shifted methine (5.62 ppm), symmetric methylenes (3.66, 2.58, 1.95 ppm), a doublet methyl (0.86 ppm) and a triplet methyl (0.79 ppm). The 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> revealed, among others, three carboxy carbons (175.7, 172.6, 161.3 ppm), an amino-methine (54.5 ppm) and an amino-methylene (45.7 ppm). Analysis of the COSY spectrum (
 <xref rid="metabolites-09-00110-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) of 
 <bold>2</bold> established two spin systems: methylenes 2 through 4 and NH-12 through CH
 <sub>3</sub>-11. These two spin systems could be extended through the HSQC and HMBC correlations (

 <italic>N</italic>-formyl-isoleucyl sub-structures. To fulfil the molecular formula of 
 <bold>2</bold>, the latter two sub-structures could be connected only through the carboxyl group of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-formyl-isoleucyl to the pyrrolidinonyl-nitrogen. The absolute stereochemistry of the chiral center of the isoleucine unit was established as L by Marfeyâ€™s analysis [
