<p>A characteristic feature of Sn containing Nb-silicide based alloys after oxidation at 1473 K is the segregation of Sn below the substrate/scale interface, which is thought to be responsible for their improved oxidation resistance at this temperature [

 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The surface segregation of Sn becomes stronger as the concentration of Sn in the alloy increases, and in the Sn rich microstructure at the substrate/scale interface Nb

Depending on the concentration of Sn in the alloy, a continuous layer, consisting of some or all of the above intermetallic phases, can form just below the scale. A similar behaviour has not been observed for Al in Nb-silicide based alloys without Sn. However, in alloys where Al and Sn are both present, Al participates in the A15â€“(Nb,Ti)
