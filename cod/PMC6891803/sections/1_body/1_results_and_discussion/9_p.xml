<p>A quantitative analysis was performed considering the number density of pillars over the VAN film surface. To obtain the number of pillars from the simulation results, pillar areas under 5 nm
 <sup>2</sup> were neglected, considering that it represents monomers on the surface.

 </xref>a,b show the comparison of the number density between KMCS and experimental results, respectively, as a function of the different substrate temperatures for a 20 Hz deposition rate and the different deposition rates for a substrate temperature of 800 °C. The KMCS results show good qualitative agreement with respect to the evolution of pillar density upon changes in synthesis parameters, with a difference of a factor of 100. This difference is caused by the
