<p id="Par13">To inspect the GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub> ceramics surface we used the EBSD technique. The scanning electron microscope image in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows the surface morphology of the sample covering 250 × 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>m
 <sup>2</sup>. As can be seen, some smaller grains were removed from the surface by the polishing. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows an EBSD micrograph (inverse pole figure map) of the above area. The average grain size of this material is (6.8 ± 3.8) 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, according to the EBSD data. However, it is necessary to point out that several grains within the map reach the size of ≈25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m. Some of these grains were thereafter chosen for further analysis. The selected grains, labelled A, B, C, D, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> with their respective orientation. The colour coding of the inverse pole figure map refers to the standard unit triangle shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. The positions of grains A, B, C, D in this unit triangle are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>. The EBSD imaged area has been marked by focused ion beam (FIB) in order to facilitate its localisation under the optical microscope (not shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
