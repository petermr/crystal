<p id="Par6">The nanocrystalline material shows reasonable electrocatalytic behaviour when drop-cast onto a glassy carbon working electrode (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, red line) and thus, it tends to perform similar to current state-of-the-art catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, continuous reductive potential cycling (over the range +0.2 V to −0.5 V vs. NHE at a scan rate of 100 mV/s) leads to an activation of the 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> phase as evidenced by a dramatic improvement in overpotential (blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). At a current density of −10 mA cm

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>) the overpotential improves from 320 ± 12 mV to 178 ± 8 mV after only 100 cycles. After reaching this improved value of 178 mV, the overpotential stabilises and no further changes are observed after 1000 cycles. A similar electrochemical enhancement can be achieved under a fixed potential bias: Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows that when a fixed overpotential of 320 mV is applied to the electrode, the current density increases rapidly over the following 90 min, eventually resulting in values in excess of −35 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref> show that this enhanced current density corresponds to enhanced hydrogen production with increasing current density. Control experiments were also undertaken with a saturated Hg/Hg
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> reference electrode in order to rule out any silver leakage from the Ag/AgCl reference electrode as the source of the enhanced current densities obtained (Supplementary Fig.
