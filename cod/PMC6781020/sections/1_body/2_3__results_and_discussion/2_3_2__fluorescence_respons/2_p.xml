<p>The detection of heavy metal ions is completed by the quenching of fluorescence. The quenching mechanism has been proven to be complex [

 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], in which the heavy metal ions interfere with the fluorescence emission by adsorbing the energy of electron transition from conduction band to valence band. The prepared SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs have an emission peak at 300 nm, in agreement with the previous report [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The position of the emission peak remained the same after the incorporation of heavy metals, revealing that the band gap had not shifted. Thus, the fluorescence quenching may result from the variation of surface states of the QDs. The radius of Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> ion was found to be 69 pm, while the heavy metals of Cd
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> have the ion radii of 78, 64.5, 69 and 119 pm [
 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b. It was found that the radius difference between heavy metal ions with Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> had the same relationship with the response of fluorescence quenching. The Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ion had the same radius as the Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> ion and this could promote its interaction with the QD surface, where the crystal lattice is lacking in integrity. Therefore, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions perform as surface states on QDs and cause a strong fluorescence quenching. For the other heavy metal ions, their radii differed from Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> and the radius difference would bring mismatches in crystal lattice when they interact with QD surface. Hence, the density of surface states would be limited, leaving the little fluorescence responses.
