<p>PL spectra were taken in backscattering geometry using a micro-Raman spectrometer (Horiba HR800). A 488-nm laser (Argon ion) was introduced using a 50× long focus lens, and emission signals were collected through the same lens, resolved by a grating (300 g/mm) and imaged with a liquid nitrogen–cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. A 490-nm long-wavelength pass filter was mounted in front of the CCD detector to filter out the excitation line.</p>
