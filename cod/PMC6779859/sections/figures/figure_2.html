 <caption> Zeeman energy scheme of 1 as a function of the applied magnetic field, derived by diagonalizing Equation (1). Each Zeeman curve is labeled with the corresponding m S projection of the ground electron quantum number S = 7/2 of Gd 3+. Numbers 1â€“7 label each resonant transition with the working microwave frequency. </caption>
