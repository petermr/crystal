<p>In the process of the preparation of BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, the mixture of rare-earth ions and the change in the matrix both result in the generation of the defects. Because the ionic radii of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> are more close to Ba
 <sup>2+</sup>, the doping Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions in the lattice mainly substitute the position of Ba
 <sup>2+</sup>. The ionic solid-phase reaction chemical formula of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions doped into the matrix is as follows:

 </disp-formula>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doped into the lattice is a kind of equivalent substitution process. The lattice defect Eu
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">×</sup> is generated after the substitution of Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> without charge. Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> that entered the lattice is a kind of non-equivalent substitution process. Point defect Tm
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">•</sup> is generated after the substitution of Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> with positive charge. To balance the charge of the crystal, one Ba ion vacancy V
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">″</sup> with two negative charges will be generated when two Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions enter the lattice. Reducing the synthetic atmosphere makes some O ions react with the reducing gas and break away. Thus, there exists O ion vacancy V
 <sub>O</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">••</sup> in the synthetic material.

 </sup> Eu
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">×</sup> is electrically neutral. Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> (Tm
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">•</sup>) bears one positive charge. V
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">″</sup> bears two negative charges. V
 <sub>O</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">••</sup> bears two positive charges. Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, as the luminescent center in Eu
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">×</sup>, mainly affects the photoluminescence property and persistent luminescence color of the material. V
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">″</sup> bears two negative charges, which can act as the vacancy trap in the material. Owing to the positive charge of Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> (Tm
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">•</sup>) and V
 <sub>O</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">••</sup> defects, they are able to serve as the electron capture trap.
