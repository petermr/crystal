 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-f006">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the relative angular luminance distribution of the OLED device with the implemented YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer as a function of thickness of the scattering layers. Compared to Lambertian distribution, for the reference device it was observed that the luminance at high angles was larger than that at normal direction. The OLED devices with implemented scattering layers showed enhanced luminance distribution at all the angles. Moreover, at the scattering layer thickness of 2.5 μm, the most enhanced luminance was achieved. Consequently, the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer enhanced the light extraction efficiency to all angular directions by the optimized scatter effect. Moreover, enhanced light extraction at high viewing angles improved the angular color change of the OLED device. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows, the white angular dependency (WAD), which represents color change by angular viewing direction, decreased significantly. The color coordinate change (Δu’v’) of the reference device at 60° was 0.028, while that of the OLED device with the 2.5 μm thick scattering layer was 0.005, which is an 82% decrease of color change. Hence, due to the scatter effect of the YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer, we achieved not only enhanced light extraction efficiency but also improved angular color change of the OLED device.
