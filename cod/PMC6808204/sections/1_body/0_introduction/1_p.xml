<p>Light-emitting carbon dots (CDots) are a new class of nanomaterials showing unique optical performance characterized by a wide wavelength tunability, high quantum yield and high photostability, while they show low toxicity and can be produced easily and at low cost [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The combination of such significant features renders CDots attractive for various applications, including bio-imaging [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], drug and gene delivery [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], sensors [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], photocatalysis [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], energy storage [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Typically, these materials contain an internal carbon core, conjugated sp
 <sup>2</sup> domains and some functional groups attached to their surface. The emission corresponding to such a structure is considered to originate from the conjugated sp
 <sup>2</sup>-domains [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and can be adjusted either by modulating the dimension of these sp
 <sup>2</sup>-domains [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or through surface modifications [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For instance, doping of the CDots with heteroatoms such as nitrogen can lead to a wavelength adjustment of the corresponding emission [
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the details of the mechanism behind the optical characteristics of these materials are still being theoretically and experimentally explored by researchers.
