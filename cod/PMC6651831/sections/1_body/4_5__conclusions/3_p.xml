<p>This study also showed that the alignment of the component’s local property axes in the composite can lead to significant variance in the Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values of the composite. For the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub>/Copper composite, the difference in the thermoelectric performance caused by the alignment of the anisotropic component’s property axis was 50%. For the SnSe/Copper composite, this difference exceeded 400%. This discrepancy was mainly caused by the variance in the anisotropic properties among different material property axis directions in the component phase.
