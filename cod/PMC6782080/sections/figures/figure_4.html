 <caption> ( a), ( b) HRTEM and ( c) low-resolution STEM micrographs of ZnO nanospike cross sections along their growth direction, which is . The spikes contain a high density of twinned domains (red dashed lines represent twin boundaries) and basal-plane stacking-mismatch defects (arrows). Often, twin boundaries of type split the crystal into larger domains. </caption>
