 </sup>. Crystal structures of the phases were first fully relaxed with constrained unit cell volumes corresponding to the experimental volumes at the respective pressure. Then a force field was obtained in a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell (384 atoms), based on 144 single atomic displacements with an amplitude of 0.01 Å. As our main task was to investigate the dynamic stability/instability of the new silica phases at room temperature, we did not take into account the LO–TO splitting in high-frequency optical branches. Reciprocal space was sampled using the 2 × 2 × 2 Γ-centered
