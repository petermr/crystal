<p>The formed intercondylar fossa divided the distal epiphysis into the lateral and medial condyles of the femur at CS20 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221569.s004">S3 Movie</xref>). As for the proximal epiphysis, the femoral head and greater trochanter began to be clearly discernible after CS20. The signal intensity became low at the center of the diaphysis at around CS21 on PCX-CT (yellow arrow in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The region was detected on MR images at CS22 (yellow arrow in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This region spread toward both epiphyses until the end of the embryonic period (CS23). The region with low signal intensity corresponded to phase 4 according to Streeter’s classification (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221569.s001">S1 Supplementary Experiments</xref>). The femoral neck was narrow, and the lesser and greater trochanters became recognizable at CS23 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221569.s007">S6 Movie</xref>). The femoral head fovea was not detected. All femurs developed from cartilage tissues (phases 1–4 according to Streeter’s classification) and showed no ossification until the end of the embryonic period (CS23).
