<p>More importantly, it is found the XA-type ferromagnetic structures have the lowest total energy for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, which implies the XA-type structure is the stable state. For Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi, its XA structure obeys the general site preference rule: two Fe atoms have less valence electrons than Ni atom and they occupy the A and B sites. While for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, it does not follow this rule and two Ni atoms with more valence electrons enter the A and B sites forming the XA structure instead of L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure. In addition, some studies show that the pure metal structure of X element from the Heusler alloy X
 <sub>2</sub>YZ has influence on its atomic ordering [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], i.e. when X metal prefers a FCC or HCP structure, the X
 <sub>2</sub>YZ Heusler crystalizes in the L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure; while X metal with BCC structure would lead to the XA structure. This rule is also coincident with Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi, because pure Fe metal has BCC structure. But for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, pure Ni metal prefers FCC structure and this would predict the L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure, contrary to the stable XA structure. Since both L2
 <sub>1</sub> and XA structures have been experimentally demonstrated in Heusler alloys, we still keep these two structures for the following consideration.
