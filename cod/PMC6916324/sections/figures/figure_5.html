 <caption> a) Positions of the VSCCs (blue) and negative charge depletion (red) around the fivefold coordinated Co 5 ion as calculated from multipole refinements from DFT. b)–h) Maximally localized Wannier functions (isovalue ±0.2 Å −3) around Co [5by]. The chosen local coordinate system is indicated and is illustrated in more detail in Figure  3 a/b. b) and c) show spin‐down functions (orange and gray), together with the VSCCs (blue octahedron), d)–h) represent spin‐up functions (pink and cyan), together with charge depletion regions (red approximate cube). </caption>
