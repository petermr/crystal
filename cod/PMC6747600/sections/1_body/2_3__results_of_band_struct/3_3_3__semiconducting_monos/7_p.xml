<p>Another interesting feature of the FeSi band structure is the complex constant-energy surfaces, as was noted in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], where the bands structures of FeSi, RuSi and OsSi were calculated without SOC. Our calculations without SOC agree with the

 </inline-formula> values obtained in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The authors of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] noted that the position of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) actually did not lie on high-symmetry lines, and that the constant-energy surfaces are strongly nonellipsoidal. Our calculations with SOC inclusion confirm this conclusion. Therefore, band gaps determined for FeSi from the energy spectrum, given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f002">Figure 2</xref>, are about 6 meV larger than the band gap obtained from the density of states, calculated on the fine grid using tetrahedral interpolation. At the same time, for RuSi and OsSi, this difference was almost negligible (&lt;1 meV). Although this difference is small even for FeSi, it leads to the strong energy dependence of density of states near the band edges. The density of states for FeSi, RuSi, and OsSi near the band gap are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f005">Figure 5</xref>. It can be seen that, passing from FeSi to OsSi, DOS sharpness at the band edges decreases. To better illustrate this, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f011">Figure 11</xref>, we plotted constant-energy surfaces for FeSi, calculated for energies at the band edges, shown by dashed lines on the band diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f011">Figure 11</xref>, it can be seen that these energy surfaces have nonzero volume with a very unusual shape due to the location of the band extrema, away from high-symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone.
