The uptakes are computed from the lowest pressure, running GCMC for 1000 cycles for initialization and 10 000 for production, and restarting from the final configuration, for the next pressure calculation. The heat of adsorption is computed during GCMC using the particle fluctuation method.

 </sup> Blocking spheres are considered, to prevent the insertion of gas molecules in nonaccessible pores. COFs with null probe-occupiable accessible pore volume are considered nonporous, and for these materials the isotherms were not computed.
