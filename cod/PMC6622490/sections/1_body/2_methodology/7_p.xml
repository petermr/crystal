<p>It covers the range of sound level pressure (dB) recorded through this study as represented earlier in 
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. From the data sheet of the selected transducer (QB220-503YB) sound power produced by one piezoelectric transducer by the following equation (2): Power = I * V (uW) where (I) is the electric current and (V) is the voltage of the piezoelectric transducer [
