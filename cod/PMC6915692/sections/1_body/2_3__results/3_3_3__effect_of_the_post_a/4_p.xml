<p>The optical properties of the powders obtained by diffuse reflection are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f013">Figure 13</xref>. The compounds can be divided into two series: the ones annealed with the oxygen partial pressure equal to 10
 <sup>−4</sup> or 10
 <sup>−5</sup> bar (dark samples), and the others obtained after oxidative thermal treatment, i.e., for the oxygen partial pressure equal to 0.2 (air), 10
 <sup>−2</sup>, 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar, (clear samples). In the first series, the whole part of the spectrum, UV-visible-NIR range, is subjected to a strong and wide absorption. The annealed powder at 10
 <sup>−4</sup> bar shows a behavior very close to the powder annealed under argon. Nonetheless, a low intense reflectivity windows emerges for the 10
 <sup>−4</sup> bar sample; in fact, this material has a diffuse reflectance spectrum, which can be described as intermediate between the non-annealed powder (blue sample) and the argon annealed sample (black powder). In the second series, the comparison between the sample annealed at 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar, 10
 <sup>−2</sup> bar and under air atmosphere, shows a progressive divergence in their reflectance spectra: the higher the oxygen partial pressure is, the lower intensity the inter-valence band responsible for the visible-near infrared absorption is (centered at about 2 micron wavelength). Consequently, the maximum of reflectivity percentage located at 500 nm increases from 76% for the 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar sample, to 81% for the 10
 <sup>−2</sup> bar sample and up to 85% for the sample annealed under air. The luminosity L*, directly linked to this maximum of reflectance, represents the adequate parameter to quantify the phenomenon. The L* value increases for the three as-prepared sample from 87.96, to 91.00 and then 93.18, as the oxidative behavior of the annealing atmosphere increases. At 2000 nm, the comparison of the reflectivity percentage between the three samples of this second series exhibits the same behavior: with a value varying from 15% for the 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar sample, to 18% for the 10
 <sup>−2</sup> bar sample and up to 40% for the sample annealed under air. Interestingly, the reflectance contrast (ΔR) between 500 and 2000 nm is only 45% for the sample obtained under air, whereas it reaches more than 60% for the two samples obtained at an oxygen partial pressure of 10
 <sup>−2</sup> or 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar. Hence, these two latter samples, exhibit the best selectivity for the use of these compounds as solar filter, i.e., with the best contrast between the visible and near-infrared transmission. The optical properties of the two last samples, in an applicative point of view, would be very interesting for their use as passive heat regulators if they were shaped as thin films on glass windows.
