<p>Analyzing the atomic structure is possible because the HRTEM images and the images obtained by interference microscopes [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] are similar. An ideally plane wave electron beam interacts with the crystalline structure and produces an image at the image plane. The image of the microscope is a scalar field of gray levels resulting from the recording by the microscope sensor of the arriving electromagnetic magnetic wavefronts. The arriving signal is a phasor 
 <bold>E</bold>(r)e
 <sup>ϕ(r)</sup>, where 
 <bold>E</bold>(r) is the amplitude and ϕ(r) is the phase, and the sensor only records the amplitude. The image intensity distribution of gray levels is a function of the microscope contrast transfer function [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This function defines the spatial resolution of the microscope. The spatial resolution of the gray levels depends on the instrument properties and on the coherence of the illuminating electron beam. The levels of gray are recorded by a raster of sensors similar to the sensors utilized in electronic cameras. Hence, image resolution depends on sensor size similarly to the case of electronic cameras. The experimentally measured distribution of gray levels can be corrected via software by modifying the contrast transfer function. This is equivalent to correcting optical transfer function in visible optics. The gray level density distribution is a 2D function since it corresponds to images captured on a plane. Maximum observed gray level densities occur at regions where the maximum electronic density is located. In turn, maximum electronic densities take place at the atomic nuclei. As such, observed gray level distributions can be utilized as tools to define atomic positions in 2-D.
