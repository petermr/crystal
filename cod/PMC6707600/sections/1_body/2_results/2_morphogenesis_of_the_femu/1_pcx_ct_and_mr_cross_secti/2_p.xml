<p>The region with very high signal intensity emerged at the center of the diaphysis, which split the region with slightly low signal intensity (phase 4) in fetuses with a CRL of 40.0 mm. The high signal intensity might have resulted from the influx of blood flow and degeneration of cartilage cells, which corresponded to phase 5 and phase OS (

The high signal intensity in the region changed to a mixture of low and high signal intensity (netlike pattern) in fetuses with a CRL of 56.5 mm. The phase 4 (low signal intensity) and phase 5 (high signal intensity) regions became confined to the metaphysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221569.s012">S2 Fig</xref>). Almost all diaphyses showed low signal intensity in fetuses with CRL ranging from 69.0 to 103 mm (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221569.s013">S3 Fig</xref>). The border of the metaphysis became sharp with high signal intensity band (phase 5); the phase 5 region as well as the vague region with low signal intensity (phase 4) might become the epiphyseal cartilage plate. In comparison, the diaphysis showed a mixture of high and low signal intensity in fetuses with a CRL of 112 mm. All borders of the femur were recognized as regions with high signal intensity, and the periosteal color was not discernible from the border of the epiphysis on MRI.
