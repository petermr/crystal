 <caption> Efficiency and stability of sky-blue PeLEDs with YCl 3. a Device structure of the PeLEDs. b A photograph of the fabricated PeLED showing sky-blue EL emission under bias. Current density-bias ( c), luminance-bias ( d), EQE-current density ( e) curves of CsPbBr 3:PEACl (1:1) devices with different ratios of YCl 3. Current density-bias ( c), luminance-bias ( d), EQE-current density ( e) curves of a CsPbBr 3 perovskite LED. f Statistic EQEs of sky-blue PeLEDs with or without YCl 3. g Electroluminescence spectrum stability test of a sky-blue PeLED with continuous bias of 3.2 V for 120 min. h Operational stability test of a sky-blue PeLED with initial luminance around 100 cd m −2. The stability test was conducted in N 2 glovebox without device encapsulation. i Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements to reveal the ion migration activation energies of CsPbBr 2.4Cl 0.6, CsPbBr 2.4Cl 0.6 with 2% YCl 3, and CsPbBr 3:PEACl (1:1) films. </caption>
