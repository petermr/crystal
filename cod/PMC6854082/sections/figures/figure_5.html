 <caption> Linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space in 2D SnTe thin film. a The x components of spin polarizations when a 0.1 V/Å external electric field parallel to y axis (i.e., normal to the film) is added. The vanishing y and z components are not shown. b Local spin polarizations of Sn and Te atoms for the Bloch states marked with the red points III and IV in a. c Dependence of S x on the external electric field for the Bloch state marked with the red point III </caption>
