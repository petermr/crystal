 <caption> Investigation into the activation mechanism of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2. a 3d Mo XPS spectra of activated (after 100 cycles) and non-activated nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2. b 3d Te XPS spectra of activated and non-activated nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2. c Cyclic voltammograms showing the consequent deactivation of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2 in 1 M H 2SO 4 under a nitrogen atmosphere using a scan rate of 10 mV s −1. During the first anodic sweep, two oxidations occur followed by a decrease in current density at cathodic potentials indicating catalyst deactivation. d Cyclic voltammogram of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe 2 before and after 100 cycles during which the edge sites are reversibly oxidized/reduced. Measurements were performed in 1 M H 2SO 4 under a nitrogen atmosphere with a scan rate of 100 mV s −1 </caption>
