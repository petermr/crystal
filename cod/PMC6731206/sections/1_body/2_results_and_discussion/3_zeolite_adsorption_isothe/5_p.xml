<p id="p0155">For nickel and iron the linearity keeps up to throughout the range equilibrium concentration, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>

 </sup> = 0.948. For cobalt there is the correlation coefficient R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.866. Thus, using the equation of Langmuir is more preferred in the range of studied concentrations of non-ferrous metal.
