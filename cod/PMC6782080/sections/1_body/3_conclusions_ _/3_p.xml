<p>In conclusion, the combination of both plan-view and cross-section analysis allows for an unambiguous determination of structural defects which are not directly accessible with a simple plan-view experiment. This combined 3D crystallographic examination approach proved to be extremely valuable and could be extended to a variety of anisotropic nanostructures.</p>
