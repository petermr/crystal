 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] because of its low thermal conductivity, excellent electrical and optical properties, as well as excellent thermal stability and low-toxic constituent elements. At atmospheric pressure, GeSe crystallizes into an orthorhombic structure with a 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> space group. The unit cell contains eight atoms, arranged in two layers, and each layer consists of four atoms; all of them are located at the 4c Wyckoff site (the crystal structure is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. The atoms within the layer form strong covalent Ge–Se bonds, and each Ge atom is coordinated with the other three nearest Se atoms. Additionally, the interlayer is piled up with weak van der Waals interaction along the a axis, and it forms a zigzag Ge–Se chain along the c axis.
