 <sub>2</sub>O (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA, 99%) were dissolved in a 10% saturated solution of citric acid. Afterwards, RuO
 <sub>2</sub> (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) was added as a powder and kept in suspension until the solution was slowly evaporated and an organic resin was formed. The latter was dried at 120 °C and decomposed at 600 °C for 12 h. Finally, the solid was fired in air at 1000 °C for 24 h and used without further treatment.
