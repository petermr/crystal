<p>This electron is transferred to the oxide lattice, and occupies one of the localized 3
 <italic>d</italic> orbitals of the nearest neighbor Ti
 <sub>5
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> ions. As a result, this Ti
 <sup>4+</sup> ion is reduced and converted to a Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> ion. The analysis of the spin (unpaired electrons) population confirms the transfer of an electron onto the Ti ion. The magnetic moment is 0.920 μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> for PP–PW (PBE+U), 0.957 μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> for AE–LCAO (HSE) and 0.944 μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> for AE–LCAO (B3LYP). This localization of the electron is due to on–site electronic correlation and therefore one could expect it to be much less when compared to the LDA or GGA approximations.
