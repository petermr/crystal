<p>As with other purine family riboswitches, 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II) recognizes the ligand nucleobase through a base triple involving a pyrimidine residue at position 51 in J2–3 and a pyrimidine at position 78 in J3–1 (the equivalent positions in 
 <italic>xpt</italic> are 51 and 74, respectively). C78 forms a Watson–Crick base pair with the 2′-deoxyguanosine nucleobase. Nucleotide 78, which is universally conserved, is essential for high affinity ligand binding; its mutation to adenosine results in 1200-fold weaker binding affinity (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). C51 pairs with the ligand's sugar edge, in the same fashion as the equivalent base, C58, in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Mutation of C51 to uridine results in significant loss of ligand binding affinity (∼18-fold, Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), similar to the same mutation in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I) (83-fold, (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)). Finally, while U47 in 
 <italic>xpt</italic> directly interacts with U51, the equivalent nucleotide in both classes of 2′-dG riboswitches is positioned within a three base stack and does not play a direct role in ligand binding. Thus, base recognition in 2′-dG-II uses the same set of same contacts as 2′-dG-I and accommodates the 2′-deoxyribose sugar moiety through a shift of C51 towards C74 as compared to the positioning of U51 in guanine and adenine riboswitch aptamers (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
