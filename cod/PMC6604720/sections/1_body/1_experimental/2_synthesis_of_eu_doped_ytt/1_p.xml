<p>An amount of yttrium(III) acetate hydrate (5.63 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol) and a varying amount of europium(III) acetate hydrate were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water. Depending on the dopant ratio, the amount of europium(III) acetate hydrate was added (for instance, to achieve 7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> dopant ratio, 4.55 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> mol of europium(III) acetate hydrate was employed). Subsequently, the mixture was stirred in a glass container until it appeared transparent. An amount of LiOH (0.04 mol) was added into the transparent solution, respectively. Selecting LiOH as the ion source is critical here since the other possible ions such as Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> are not as reactive as Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions. Such a high reactivity of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions in the solution is expected to distort the crystal structure relatively more compared to other possible ions and can therefore lead to an increase in the formation of defects to make the doping process more favorable (as previously mentioned at the end of the Introduction section). The solutions were mixed and sonicated for 5 min. After the sonication process, the reaction was maintained for various reaction times (5, 15, 45, 60 min) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was centrifuged twice with water and once with ethanol (5 min, 6000 rpm). After centrifugation, the isolated products were dried in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h.
