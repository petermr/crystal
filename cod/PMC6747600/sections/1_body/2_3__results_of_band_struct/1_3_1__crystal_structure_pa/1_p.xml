 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]: CrSi, MnSi, FeSi, CoSi, NiSi, TcSi, RuSi, RhSi, ReSi. In addition, CoGe, CoSn, RhGe, and RhSn were considered to compare their topological properties with those of CoSi. Most of the compounds have a stable FeSi-type structure, although density functional calculations predicted that the most stable phase differs from B20 for CrSi, NiSi, RhSi, OsSi, IrSi, CoGe, CoSn and RhGe. However, the samples of CoGe and RhGe with a B20 structure were obtained using high-pressure synthesis [
