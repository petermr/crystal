  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> with three intermediate images. When the convergence of the computation was not satisfactory or when more detailed migration paths should be investigated, seven intermediate images were employed. The CI-NEB calculations were performed until the forces decreased below 0.03 eV/Å with a spring constant of 5 eV/Å
 <sup>2</sup> between the images. We employed a doubly charged oxygen vacancy (

 <sup>2+</sup>) and oxygen interstitial (O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>
 <sup>2−</sup>) for 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>mig</italic>
 </sub> assuming that these charged point defects were formed by extrinsic doping with aliovalent cations. Visualizations of the crystal structures and confirmation of the effective coordination numbers of the cations were performed using the VESTA program
