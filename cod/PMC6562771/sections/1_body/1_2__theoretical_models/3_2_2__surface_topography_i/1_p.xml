<p>With the theoretical results in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-micromachines-10-00288">Section 2.1</xref>, researchers can acquire the surface profile in one feed rate. The following procedure is to establish the surface topography in the radial direction since it is the foundation of the 3D topography model. To obtain the surface topography model, the ‘trim principle’ is extensively employed in the calculation process [
