In the studied HEA, the anisotropy factor as obtained from the MD simulation was found to be between 2.15–2.26, indicating a lower elastic strain energy along &lt;1 0 0&gt; directions. The elastic stiffness constants of the constitutive elements of the HEA and the alloy average structure as calculated from MD simulation are compared with experimental results in Table
