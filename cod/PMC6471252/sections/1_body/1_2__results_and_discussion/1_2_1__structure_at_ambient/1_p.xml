 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In order to have a reference for the high-pressure studies, the structure was re-determined at room temperature and ambient pressure. A series of short single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments was also conducted in order to ensure that no phase transitions took place between room temperature and 100 K.
