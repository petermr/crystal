<p id="Par12">Iron (Fe) nanoplates with bcc lattices (lattice constant 
 <italic>a</italic> = 2.8665 Å), which are composed of three atomic layers (the diameter 
 <italic>d</italic> = 32
 <italic>a</italic> in most cases), were first modeled. Initially, their surfaces are respectively set to be different low-index planes, including (111), (001), and (110). In addition, other bcc metallic nanoplates, such as W, Nb, Mo, and Cr, were also accordingly constructed. These models were created via commands in the MD package LAMMPS [
