<p id="Par8">K

 <sub>7</sub> host (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) offers one Lu sites with 6-fold coordination, and two different K sites: K1 (9-fold) and K2 (6-fold), for the possible occupation by Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. The cell volume increases with 
 <italic>x</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), indicating that some Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions occupy Lu sites since the radius of Lu
 <sup>3+</sup> is smaller than that of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). However, the unit cell volume, 
 <italic>V</italic>(
 <italic>x</italic>) shows a nonlinear increasing trend with increasing Eu content, thus another occupation mechanism should exist simultaneously, which competes with the main trend and reduces cell volume. Such mechanism can be ascribed to K → Eu replacement because K ion is bigger than Eu ion (Supplementary Table

 <sup>2+</sup> selective site occupation, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> illustrates the average bond lengths of LuO

 <sup>2+</sup> doped K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> by extracting the data from Rietveld refinement. With increasing Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doping concentration, the average bond lengths of K1-O remain nearly unchanged, while the bond lengths of K2-O and Lu-O change significantly. In addition, the d(K2-O) and d(Lu-O) exhibit the same trend. It is owing to the fact that the occupation of Eu in Lu sites will lead to longer d(Lu-O) bond length, simultaneously, the amount of Eu in K2 sites is reduced and thus d(K2-O) bond lengths also become longer. Therefore, one can conclude that the main doping mechanism is ascribed to the synergetic effect of Lu → Eu and K → Eu replacements in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
