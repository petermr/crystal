 <caption> Data on EuFe 2As 2 ‘crystal a’ and ‘crystal b’. ( a) Specific heat, C(T), results with transitions associated with Eu ( T N = 21 K) and Fe ordering ( T N = 195 K or 175 K). ( b) Precession images showing the [HK0] and [H0L] reciprocal lattice planes reconstructed from single crystal X-ray diffraction patterns measured at room temperature. Smearing in diffraction spots are more prevalent in ‘crystal a,’ noted in [H0L] plane. </caption>
