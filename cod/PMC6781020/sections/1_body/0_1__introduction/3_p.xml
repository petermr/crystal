<p>The effect of fluorescence is a process where a QD emits light after it has absorbed electromagnetic radiation from a excitation source. The electrons in valence band are stimulated to reach conduction band by the excitation light. Then, when the electrons transit from conduction band to valence band, the fluorescence emission takes place as a kind of energy release [

 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The ions of heavy metals can adsorb the released energy of the electron transition, interfering with the fluorescence emission. Therefore, the fluorescence nature of semiconductor QDs has been put into practice of heavy metal ion detection, even though the mechanism of fluorescence quenching is still of high complexity.
