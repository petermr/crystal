 <caption> 3D-SAROM on a polycrystalline sapphire sample. The colors refer to orientations as shown by the inverse pole figure (inserted). The green boundaries between grains were generated as part of the segmentation procedure (Supplementary Figs.  32– 34, Table  S1). SAROM was performed at a lateral step size of 0.7 µm, axial step size of 1.7 µm. Map dimension is 57 × 56 × 18 pixels or 40 × 39.2 × 30.6 µm with an average exposure time per step of 180 ms. </caption>
