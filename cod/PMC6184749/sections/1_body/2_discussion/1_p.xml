<p class="p">In summary, we have reproducibly grown ideal single crystals of the Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SR)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> nanoparticle and resolved its structure using XRC on the basis of designed intra- and interparticle weak interactions, as these play critical roles in growing high-quality single crystals of metal nanoparticles. XRC also reveals a multiplicity of Au–Au bond lengths in the kernel of Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SR)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub>, indicating that Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SR)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> is a transition size in terms of Au–Au bonding character. It is found that the Au–Au bond with the length close to that of bulk gold shows the best thermal extensibility among various Au–Au bonds in the Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SR)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> nanoparticle, which provides an atomic-level perspective for the fact that metals generally show better thermal extensibility than nonmetal solid materials. The significance and novelty of our work include the following: (i) We resolved a structure that has perplexed the scientific community for nearly a decade since its composition determination by ESI-MS. (ii) The available structure will pave the way for future research of structure-property correlation, transition-sized nanoparticles, etc. (iii) We provided important implications and guidance for the challenging single-crystal growth of metal nanoparticles. (iv) This work also provided an atomic-level perspective for the good thermal extensibility of metals compared with other common nonmetal solid materials.
