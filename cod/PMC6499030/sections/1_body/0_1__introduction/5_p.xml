<p>A judicious combination of the PP–PW and AE–LCAO approaches can provide an accurate description of complex defective and hybrid organic/oxide structures needed to understand and to improve the chemical reactivity and the photocatalytic properties. Once we have shown that the AE–LCAO approach with the HSE functional is able to accurately describe this surface, we go one step further by studying the adsorption of the phthalocyanine H
 <sub>2</sub>Pc on anatase (101). In the molecule-surface interaction, the effect of the Van der Waals forces is more important and has been taken into account by adding the D3 dispersion correction (HSED3) (Grimme and Krieg, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We will show an analysis of the optimized structure and stability of this interaction, which will be a valuable tool in order to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. The article is structured as follows. In section 2 details are presented. In sections 3.1 and 3.2 the results for the bulk and stoichiometric anatase (101) surface are shown as a reference. The main features of the oxygen defective anatase (101) surface, together with the adsorption of both hydrogen and phthalocyanine on it are presented in sections 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively.
