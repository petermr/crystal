<p>The design and discovery of new quantum materials with desired electronic and magnetic functionality, especially materials where quantum effects result in topological electronic properties, is a new challenge and one of the frontiers of research in materials chemistry and materials physics.

 </sup> There is a crucial need for the discovery of new materials that in particular harness the topological quantum states of matter, to increase our understanding of these newly recognized electronic states and to realize their potential in devices.

 </sup> In this context, topological insulators (TIs), which support fundamentally different surface (i.e., “topologically protected”) and bulk electronic states, are of particular interest.

 </sup> When additional quantum phases such as superconductivity, magnetism, or charge density waves are also present, new electronic properties can arise due to their interactions with the surface states.

 </sup> Currently, the study of such systems in materials physics frequently focuses on heterostructures consisting of TI/magnetic multilayers.

 </sup> Unfortunately, these systems cannot be widely studied due to the uncommon procedures required to make them. Thus, the design of novel magnetic topological quantum materials that are widely synthetically accessible is highly sought. Theorists have scoured the ICSD for previously reported materials that can display topological electronic properties, but the design of totally new topological quantum materials remains rare, especially for cases where the interactions of different quantum states are expected.
