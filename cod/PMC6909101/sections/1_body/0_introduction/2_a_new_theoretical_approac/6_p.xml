<p id="p0030">Quantum-classical mechanics provide insights into an entire series of the fundamental experimental results in chemistry, which in the past often resisted insight in the scope of the standard quantum mechanics of electron-nuclear motion. In the framework of quantum-classical mechanics, it is possible to explain, for example, experimental data on the shape of the optical bands of polymethine dyes and their aggregates in solutions, in which the quantum-classical transitions in their main optical chromophores can be approximated by elementary electron-charge-transfer processes in condensed matter [
