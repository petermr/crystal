<p>Topological indices started with Wienerâ€™s original paper regarding his index and the boiling points of paraffin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was not until some time later that Hosoya introduced a mathematical formalism to analyze topological indices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We have previously introduced topological indices and nanoclusters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. At this writing, there exist many indices, some of which depend on the adjacency or distance matrix. We show here that in many of the cluster shapes, magic mathematical relationships exist for the four indices as a function of 
 <italic>n</italic> and the number of shells.
