<p>The experimental protocol was developed as follows: First, the sand reservoir of the scaled wind tunnel was filled with 10 cm of clean and sieved sand. The sand was flattened as much as possible to ensure that it was as horizontal as possible at all points in the wind tunnel. With this configuration, and without ABs located in the tunnel, the sound pressure was measured with the equipment indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot5-sensors-19-04881">Section 3.5</xref>. Next, and for each of the three considered ABs, photogrammetric and sound pressure measurements were made before and after connecting the scaled wind tunnel fan. The photogrammetric measurements investigated the sand permeability behavior of the three ABs. In the same way, the acoustic measurements allowed us to quantify the shift of the acoustic attenuation capability due to the variation of the sand relief for each of the ABs tested. In the different experiments, the fan worked for three hours in a row, which was the time needed to exhaust the sand tank.
