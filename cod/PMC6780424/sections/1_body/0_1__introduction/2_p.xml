However, in recent decades, there has been a strong tendency in the literature to elucidate the sensitivity of energetic single crystals by the electron density properties in a separate molecule of EM, such as electrostatic potential, molecular electronegativities, partial atomic charges, molecular weights, vibrational states, oxygen balance of the molecules, detonation gas concentrations and heats of detonation [

These quantities ignore the deformation of the chemical bonds, the motion of the molecules, the inner/inter molecular chemical reactions and the symmetrical structure of the crystals, and thereby cannot comprehensively characterize the reaction initiation of an energetic single crystal under shock.
