<p id="Par13">We conclude that the low temperature magnetic feature observed in 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 compound could very well be a reminiscence of the weak ferromagnetism predicted by Goodenough-Kanamori rule, but could also be an independent Ni sublattice feature as is seen in other Ni analog samples, such as, Sr
 <sub>2</sub>NiWO
 <sub>6</sub> and Sr
 <sub>2</sub>NiTeO
 <sub>6</sub> with nonmagnetic W
 <sup>6+</sup> ([
 <italic>Xe</italic>] 4
 <italic>f</italic> 
 <sup>14</sup>) and Te
 <sup>6+</sup> ([
 <italic>Kr</italic>] 4
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sup>10</sup>) at the 
 <italic>B</italic>′ site, where the antiferromagnetic transition occurs at 35 K and 54 K, respectively

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. This low temperature transition has been identified as the onset of a spin glass behavior in 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 compound
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. On the other hand, the observed bifurcation between ZFC and FC curves at higher temperatures in 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 compound is clearly very similar to what is commonly observed when Re-ion sits in the geometrically frustrated fcc lattice (the 
 <italic>B</italic>′-site) within the double perovskite structure, but having nonmagnetic 
 <italic>B</italic>-site ions, e.g., Sr
 <sub>2</sub>CaReO
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, Sr
 <sub>2</sub>InReO
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
