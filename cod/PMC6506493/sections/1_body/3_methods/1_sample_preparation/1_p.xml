 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. To synthesize single crystals of Ba
 <sub>2</sub>CuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>, we first prepared Ba
 <sub>2</sub>CuTeO
 <sub>6</sub> powder through a solid-state reaction. A mixture of Ba
 <sub>2</sub>CuTeO
 <sub>6</sub> and BaCl
 <sub>2</sub> in a molar ratio of 1:10 was vacuum-sealed in a quartz tube, which acts as a SiO
 <sub>2</sub> source. The temperature at the center of the horizontal tube furnace was lowered from 1100 to 800 °C over 10 days. Plate-shaped blue single crystals with a maximum size of 10 × 10 × 1.5 mm
 <sup>3</sup> were obtained. The wide plane of the crystals was confirmed to be the crystallographic 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane by X-ray diffraction. The quartz tube frequently exploded during cooling to room temperature after the crystallization process from 1100 to 850 °C. To avoid hazardous conditions and damage to the furnace, a cylindrical nichrome protector was inserted in the furnace core tube.
