<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, we can find that with the increase in the charge density of montmorillonite, due to the negative charge of the Si–O surface increases, some of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> moved toward the Si–O surface under the action of electrostatic attraction. Therefore, some new peaks appearred around 2.5 Å–3.5 Å, which was more obvious when the layer charge density of the montmorillonite was higher (M3, M4).
