 <caption> Excitation spectra along L directions. a, b Color contour maps of scattering intensities along the L ( c *) direction. The common color scale is used. Integrated H and K ranges are shown in the figures. c, d Integrated intensity plotted against L together with a fit using the dimer structure factor represented by a solid black curve. Red circles in Fig. 3c are obtained by integrating the intensities shown in Fig. 3a between 1.66 and 2.06 meV. Red and blue circles in Fig. 3d correspond to integrated intensities between 2.22 and 2.58 meV and between 2.62 and 2.98 meV from Fig. 3b, respectively. The intensity of the higher branch is shifted upward for clarity. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file </caption>
