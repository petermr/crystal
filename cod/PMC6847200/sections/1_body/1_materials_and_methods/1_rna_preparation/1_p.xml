<p>The 
 <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG aptamer domain RNA and derivatives were 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from a PCR-generated DNA template using previously described methods (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Sequences of all RNAs used in this study are given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. After incubating for 3 h at 37°C, the transcription reaction was buffer exchanged into Milli-Q water and purified using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Product was extracted using the crush and soak technique at 4°C into 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) followed by buffer exchange with 0.5× TE buffer (5 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and concentrated to a volume of 500 μl using a 10 kDa Amicon centrifugal microconcentrator. RNA concentrations were determined using a calculated molar extinction coefficient at 260 nm wavelength; RNA was stored at –20°C until use. For crystallization and ITC, RNA was refolded by heat/cooling at 95°C for 3 min and incubating on ice for 5 min in TE buffer. Native gel electrophoresis was used to assess whether the refolded RNA adopted a single, monomeric conformation (
