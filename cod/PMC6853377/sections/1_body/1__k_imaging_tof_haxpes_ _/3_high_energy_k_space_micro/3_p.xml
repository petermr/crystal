<p>Momentum microscopy makes use of a basic concept of optics: in imaging systems the reciprocal image represents the distribution of the transversal momentum components (in mathematical language it is termed the Fourier image). Owing to 
 <italic>k</italic>-conservation in the photoemission process, the reciprocal image formed in the backfocal plane of a cathode lens directly shows the transversal momentum distribution of the valence electrons inside the crystal. A compelling advantage is that this method yields the 2D (

Energy recording via ToF bears the advantage that many energy surfaces are acquired simultaneously. The present measurements employed the 40-bunch mode of PETRA III with a pulse period of 192 ns. In an experiment at MAX II, we used the full 100 MHz filling pattern, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> 10 ns pulse period, which was sufficient for core-level XPD studies. The DLD has a spatial resolution of ∼100 µm (resolving ∼0.5 megapixels) and its maximum integral count rate is 5 Mcounts s
 <sup>−1</sup> at a time resolution of ∼150 ps.
