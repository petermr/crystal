<p>The bonding properties were analyzed using COHP curves as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02667-f002">Figure 2</xref>c. Bonding states were mainly observed in the valence band region from –8 to 0 eV for five different kinds of interactions (Li–O, Al–O, H–O, Cl–O, Cl–H). Near E
 <sub>F</sub>, the H–O interactions show weak antibonding character, while for the Cl–O and Cl–H cases, small bonding states are found. This fact evidences that the interlayer interactions in [LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>] via the Cl atoms have mainly an H∙∙∙Cl∙∙∙H bonding character and as a consequence of this weak bonding via H atoms, a mobility of the Cl atoms can be expected.
