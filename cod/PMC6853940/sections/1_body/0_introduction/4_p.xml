<p id="Par9">The extension of the ABP and AOUP models of activity to particles interacting with soft potentials is considered in the present paper. We analyze how the morphological properties of the system of particles depend on the specific modeling of the active force and if some features of the dynamics are model-independent. What happens if the non-equilibrium forcing is replaced by a colored noise term as in the AOUP model? As an example, it has been found with ABP driving that for some values of the activity parameter the clusters deform into rings with an empty interior
