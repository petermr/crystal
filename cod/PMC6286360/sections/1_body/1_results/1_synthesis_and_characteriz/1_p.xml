 </sup> in a mixture of 
 <italic>o</italic>-dichlorobenzene, mesitylene and 6 M aqueous acetic acid (10: 10: 3, v/v/v) at 120 °C for 7 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After exhaustively washed by Soxhlet extraction with tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and dichloromethane, 3D-TPE-COF was isolated in 85% yield as a yellow powder insoluble in common organic solvents and water. From the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, 3D-TPE-COF exhibited the diagnostic vibrational peak of the imine bond at 1625 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which is the same as that of the model compound (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition, the 
 <sup>13</sup>C cross-polarization with total suppression of sidebands (CP-TOSS) NMR spectrum of 3D-TPE-COF also confirmed the formation of the expected C=N bond at 158.3 ppm (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Furthermore, field-emission scanning electron microscopy images showed that 3D-TPE-COF has a rod-like morphology (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), consisting of microcrystals.
