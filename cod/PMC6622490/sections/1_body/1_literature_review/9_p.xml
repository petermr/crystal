<p>Piezoelectric materials that are used in architectural applications belong to the group of adaptive material or so called "Smart Materials" which possess both transducers and actuators characteristics. They are a thin piezo-ceramic film which is covered with electrically conducting material to make electrical contact and are subsequently embedded in an elastic polymer composite [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The transducers are simply glued to the corresponding building structure and façades or integrated in to the structure material during manufacture to detect vibrations in the component itself. They detect any change in the surrounding environmental conditions such as impact pressure or bending loads and react to them. Even under high dynamic stress or pressure the construction guarantees high damage tolerance, reliability and a life time of more than 10
 <sup>9</sup> cycles. They have low susceptibility to defect because they don’t contain any moving parts [
