 </sub>, and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> crystals were measured using a LabRAM HR 800 spectrometer equipped with an 800 mm focal length spectrograph and an air-cooled, back-thinned CCD detector. The spatial resolution of the instrument is specified as ∼1 μm. The crystal samples were placed on a glass slide and excited with a double-frequency Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). Spectra were collected at room temperature with an exposure time of 300 s and using a grating of 1800 lines/mm. For disordered α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, the laser power was varied from very low to very high. This did not lead to any notable changes in the spectra. All spectra were calibrated and normalized. α-B
 <sub>12</sub> was synthesized from crystalline β-boron in a Pt-flux at 5.5 GPa and 1000 °C using a 6–8 Walker-type multi-anvil high-pressure device (see
