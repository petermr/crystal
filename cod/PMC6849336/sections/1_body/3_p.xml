 <sub>3</sub> NCs can be accurately adjusted in the range of 462–510 nm, whereas PLQY reaches 80%. NCs can be well-purified and consequently allow for fabrication of uniform and compact, thin films. Through judicious optimization of the LED device architecture, high EQE values of 9.8%, 4.96%, 3.5%, 2.25%, and 1.03% have been obtained for EL peak positions at 512, 502, 490, 476, and 463 nm, respectively.
