<p>While a number of reviews have been published about 2D perovskites regarding their structure and application in solar cells,
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> we here summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of 2D metal halide perovskites, highlight their unique tunable bandgap, narrowband fluorescence, and white light radiation properties, discuss the charge carriers' transport, and focus more on LEDs. We hope that this review will stimulate more efforts in this field, including materials' preparation and optoelectronic device fabrications.
