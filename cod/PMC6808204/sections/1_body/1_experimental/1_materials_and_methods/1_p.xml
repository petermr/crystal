 <sup>2+</sup>, was purchased from Zhuhai Hanbo (HB-640, Guangdong, China). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEOL 2100F, operated at 200 kV) was employed to examine the morphology of the N-CDots. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS spectrometer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Spectrum 100, PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA) was used to characterize the kinetic behavior of the chemical bonds. Photoluminescence (PL) and absorbance were measured using an integrating sphere (ISP-50-80-R, Ocean Optics Inc.) attached to a USB2000+ spectrometer (Ocean Optics Inc., Dunedin, FL, USA) with a premium ﬁber cable. A commercial blue LED chip (CREE, 450 nm, royal blue) was used as the blue light source. The morphology of the produced N-CDot fibers was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quanta 250, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Lastly, CRI, CCT, luminous flux and LER were calculated using the OSRAM ColorCalculator program. The quantum yield was obtained by using a fluorometer (Horiba Scientific Fluorolog) with a quanta-φ integrating sphere. We use remote-phosphor configuration, which color conversion layer(s) placed a particular distance away from LED chip, throughout this study. Details of this configuration can be found in our previous study [
