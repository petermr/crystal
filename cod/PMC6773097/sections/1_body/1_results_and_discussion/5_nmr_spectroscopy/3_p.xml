<p>On the other hand, the ED structure analysis clearly showed that SSZ‐26 is a minor component in the SSZ‐27 sample studied. Additional modelling studies (Supporting information Table S13 and Figure S9) show that while isomer I significantly favours the formation of SSZ‐26 (−7.6 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> Si) over SSZ‐27 (−3.66 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> Si), isomer III only favors SSZ‐27 slightly (−8.95 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> Si) over SSZ‐26 (−8.18 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> Si). Then it is perhaps not surprising that some SSZ‐26 formed in the presence of isomer III, albeit more slowly than SSZ‐27. Of course, the chemical environment of isomer III in SSZ‐26 will be slightly different from that in SSZ‐27 and this will contribute to the breadth of the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR signals, making a definitive interpretation of the NMR spectra difficult. Additional NMR studies using nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) to better probe the details of the SDA within the zeolite are planned.
