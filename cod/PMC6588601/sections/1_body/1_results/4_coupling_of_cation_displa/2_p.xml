<p id="Par22">Only the translational and the bending F
 <sub>1u</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>) modes appeared to be coupled to the directions of the cation displacements. The Pb displacements are negatively correlated with those of oxygen in these modes for both the [Pb
 <sub>8</sub>(NbO
 <sub>6</sub>)] and [Pb
 <sub>8</sub>(MgO
 <sub>6</sub>)] clusters. Similar negative correlations are observed for the Nb displacements, whereas for Mg the correlations are strongly positive. The resulting oxygen-cation displacement patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>) match the low-frequency transverse optical modes commonly encountered in PMN
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup> and other perovskite ferroelectrics, which indicates that even such complex multiatomic correlations are reproduced in the refined configurations. Similar trends hold for the 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>-axis components of the deformation modes and cation displacements. No dependence of the deformation-mode amplitudes and the cation-oxygen coupling on the chemical order parameter was observed. As a soundness check for the procedure, the mean amplitudes of the breathing modes for the [NbO
 <sub>6</sub>] and [MgO
 <sub>6</sub>] octahedra were found to be negative and positive, respectively, which reflects oxygen displacements away from Mg toward Nb, consistent with the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>–Nb
 <sup>5+</sup> ionic charge difference and the stronger covalency of the Nb–O bonds; the values of the two amplitudes are correctly related according to the Nb/Mg stoichiometry. The observed correlated oxygen displacements account for a distinct appearance of the neutron single-crystal diffuse scattering near the 
 <italic>h</italic>00 Bragg peaks with 
 <italic>h</italic> = 2
 <italic>n</italic> and 
 <italic>h</italic> = 2
 <italic>n</italic> + 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>); the agreement with the experimental plots reported in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> is especially striking given that these data were not included in the present fits.
