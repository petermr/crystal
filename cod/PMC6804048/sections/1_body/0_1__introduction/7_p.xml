<p>The deformation behaviour of the microstructure of the substrate below the oxide scale is one of the factors that determines whether the scale will be retained or spalled off. Thus, knowledge of the properties of the aforementioned phases is essential for improving the oxidation of Nb-silicide based alloys. The properties of unalloyed Nb and tetragonal Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub> silicides were recently studied in [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The intermetallic phases in the Nb–Sn binary system were studied in [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the stability of A15–Nb
 <sub>3</sub>Sn has been compared with other A15 compounds of interest to the development of Nb-silicide based alloys in [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is no data on the mechanical properties of W

 <sub>3</sub> type TM

 <sub>2</sub>X compounds. Such data is essential for modelling the deformation of the substrate/scale interface in Nb-silicide based alloys.
