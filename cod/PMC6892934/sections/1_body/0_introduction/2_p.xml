<p id="Par3">Ideally, tungsten irradiated in the fusion reactor should be studied to examine the role played by helium in deciding the evolution of its properties. However, such samples being radioactive, are difficult to access and unsuitable for regular laboratory experiments. Helium-ion implantation can mimic nuclear fusion induced radiation damage by creating irradiation-damage-like lattice defects, while allowing examination of the interaction of the injected helium with these lattice defects. As such helium-implanted tungsten has been widely studied through both simulations and experiments for varying conditions of temperature and helium fluence

 </sup>. Studying helium-implanted samples exposed at room temperature allows isolated investigation of the effect of helium-implantation-induced defects on material properties, while excluding the effects of elevated temperature, impurity content, crystallographic orientation etc.
