<p>Rp values obtained for Sr
 <sub>0.9</sub>Ba
 <sub>0.1</sub>Co
 <sub>0.95</sub>Ru
 <sub>0.05</sub>O
 <sub>3−δ</sub> are comparable to those previously reported. From the data in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01957-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we can see that not necessarily only a lower polarization resistance will imply a higher power density in a single test cell. In the case of the V
 <sup>5+</sup> doped sample, the Rp is only 0.025 Ω cm
 <sup>2</sup>, and its power density is 550 mW cm
 <sup>−2</sup>; instead, for the 10% Ru
 <sup>4+</sup> doped sample, the Rp is 0.110 Ω cm
 <sup>2</sup> and its power density is 652 mW cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, both at 850 °C. This suggests that the doping cation must also have a functional catalytic activity for the ORR reaction. Comparing the results gathered in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-01957-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, it can be clearly seen that the one that outperforms under these conditions is the Ru
 <sup>4+</sup> cation with 5% of doping. The value of 0.048 Ω cm
 <sup>2</sup> determined for the present Sr
 <sub>0.9</sub>Ba
 <sub>0.1</sub>Co
 <sub>0.95</sub>Ru
 <sub>0.05</sub>O
 <sub>3−δ</sub> sample (vs. 0.070 Ω cm
 <sup>2</sup> for the parent compound) brings us to the conclusion that the introduction of Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> into the Sr site effectively decreases the polarization resistance, probably as an effect of the oxide-ion diffusion across the crystal lattice. This is auspicious regarding the performance of this material as cathode for SOFC in the intermediate temperature range.
