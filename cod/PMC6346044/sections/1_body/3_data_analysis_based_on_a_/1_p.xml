<p id="Par18">The current advent of publicly available trajectory data from numerous atomistic simulations drives interest to the implementation of smart tools that could extract information beyond the calculation that generated them. A goal of our data analyses was to find out if a machine learning protocol based exclusively on the knowledge of atomic coordinates collected along the MMC trajectories would provide a plausible physical description without knowing any of the thermodynamics findings described in the previous section. Machine learning analyses require a choice of attributes, also known as descriptors or features. We decided on the use of the Voronoi cells properties as sole attributes for the machine learning strategy described in this section because a Voronoi tessellation only requires knowledge of the coordinates of a set of points.</p>
