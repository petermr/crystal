<p>In this paper, we consider three objects. The first one is a dimer constructed by doubling the all-trans azo–BTA star shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f001">Figure 1</xref>a in its optimized geometry, as obtained in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The second one is the column of 
 <italic>N</italic> = 2–20 stars formed in MD simulations in a recent paper [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], where 
 <italic>N</italic> is the assembly size. One example with 
 <italic>N</italic> = 20 is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. Finally, the third object is the crystal of azo–BTA star experimentally characterized by Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f001">Figure 1</xref>c–e). Here, we study the crystal itself, as well as the molecular stacks obtained by multiplying the original unit cell in 
 <italic>b</italic>-direction 2–20 times. In this case, we get the columnar assemblies of the same size 
 <italic>N</italic> as in MD simulations, but having identical molecular geometries, as revealed in experiments in ref. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In all the cases, we use a full-atomistic representation of the stars, whereas the aqueous environment is modelled applying two schemes: In density functional theory (DFT) and density functional based tight-binding (DFTB+) calculations, the effects coming from the solvent are taken into account via the polarizable continuum model [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-24-04387" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], whereas for the simulation of assemblies in molecular dynamics, water is simulated explicitly.
