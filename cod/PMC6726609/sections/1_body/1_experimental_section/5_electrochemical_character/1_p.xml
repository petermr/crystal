<p id="Par10">The active material, Hg/HgO electrode and platinum electrode act as working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode for three-electrode system respectively. AC, membrane and the active materials are blended into a sandwich-like device to evaluate its performance. The Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses of the all sample were tested using the 660E electrochemical workstation produced by shanghai Chenhua, china. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were assessed by using the CT2001A LAND battery test equipment. The above all tests are performed in 2â€‰M KOH solution.</p>
