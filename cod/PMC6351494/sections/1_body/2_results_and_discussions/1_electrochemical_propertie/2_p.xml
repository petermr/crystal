<p>Even though the crystal structures of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> are very similar except the slight difference of the lattice constants, the electrochemical properties of these two compounds are significantly different. The cyclic voltammograms of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> composite electrodes in 1.0 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in AN solution, overlapped with a cyclic voltammogram of the deposition/dissolution process of magnesium metal in 0.5 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in BuMeG3 solution, are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> shows very sharp reversible peaks corresponding to demagnetization/magnetization process at −2.1 V vs. Ag
 <sup>+</sup>/Ag. Even though the sweep rate of the cyclic voltammogram is faster than reported data, the overpotential between the anodic and cathodic reaction is almost same as previous one: ~80 mV. It suggests that the overpotential is not corresponding to the reaction kinetics, but thermodynamic properties, such as solvation/desolvation energy or phase transition of the solid phase. In addition, the overpotential of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> is much lower than that of the deposition/dissolution process of the magnesium in the BuMeG3 solution. Hence the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> obviously has some advantages as a practical battery anode in the aspect of energy efficiency, besides its less capacity and higher equilibrium potential compared with magnesium metal anode. The expanded cyclic voltammogram of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> is also shown in the inset of Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Reversible current around −2.05 V vs. Ag
 <sup>+</sup>/Ag is observed, and another anodic current appeared at −1.7 V vs. Ag
 <sup>+</sup>/Ag and above. It indicates the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> also has some reversibility at slightly higher equilibrium potential of Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>, the observed current is however negligible compared with Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>. We suspect only the surface of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> particle is electrochemically active in the composite electrode.
