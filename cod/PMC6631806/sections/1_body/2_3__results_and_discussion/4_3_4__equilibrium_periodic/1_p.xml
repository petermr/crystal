<p>Up to now, we have identified three new morphologies with Im3, Pn3m, and P432 crystal symmetry. It is necessary to compare the free energies of the newly evolved nanostructures with those of previously known structures such as double gyroids and others. For this purpose, the chain architecture was fixed to the linear AB diblock copolymer and the compositions were set to

 <xref rid="polymers-11-01081-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> lists the three new morphologies along with all the known morphologies including double gyroids, Fddd, P6/mm cylinders, Im3m BCC spheres, and Pn3m double diamonds. We also added in this table the recently identified holey morphologies in our previous work such as I43d morphology of genus 21 and Ia3d morphology of genus 25 [
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Single gyroids with I4
 <sub>1</sub>32 symmetry are also included. It is well known that double gyroids are the stable morphology at the given segregation level and composition.
