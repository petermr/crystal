 <p>Novel tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complexes with five-membered N-heteroaromatic ligands, (PPh
  <sub>4</sub>)
  <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
  <sub>4</sub>L] [L = imidazole (Him) (
  <bold>2</bold>), 1-methylimidazole (Mim) (
  <bold>3</bold>), and pyrazole (pyz) (
  <bold>4</bold>)] and (PPh
  <sub>4</sub>)
  <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
  <sub>4</sub>L]·L [L = Him (
  <bold>5</bold>) and Mim (
  <bold>6</bold>)], were synthesized by the reactions of (PPh
  <sub>4</sub>)
  <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
  <sub>4</sub>] (
  <bold>1</bold>) with Him, Mim, and pyz, and their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The complexes 
  <bold>2</bold>, 
  <bold>3</bold>, 
  <bold>4</bold>, and 
  <bold>6</bold> showed intense photoluminescence, with the emission quantum yields (Φ
  <sub>em</sub>) being 0.65–0.75 in the solid state at 296 K. In contrast, the Φ
  <sub>em</sub> and τ
  <sub>em</sub> values of 
  <bold>5</bold> are significantly smaller and shorter, respectively, than the relevant values of 
  <bold>2</bold>. The interconversion reactions among 
  <bold>1</bold>, 
  <bold>2</bold>, and 
  <bold>5</bold> accompanied by large photoluminescence-intensity changes were accomplished by solvent-free reactions and exposure of water. The mechanochemical reaction of 
  <bold>2</bold> with 1 mol equiv of Him in the solid state gave 
  <bold>5</bold>. Complex 
  <bold>5</bold> was also obtained by the mechanochemical reaction of 
  <bold>1</bold> with 2 mol equivalents of Him in the solid state. By placing solid of 
  <bold>5</bold> in water, the solid showed intense photoluminescence to give 
  <bold>2</bold>. Complex 
  <bold>1</bold> was produced under vacuum at 185 °C from 
  <bold>2</bold> or 
  <bold>5</bold>.
