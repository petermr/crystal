<p id="Par7">Although the net spin polarizations are zero for both split bands in the BSVSP effect, a local spin polarization might exist, in loose analogy with the hidden spin-polarization effect. By projecting the spin polarization on atomic sites in real space, it is possible to evaluate the contribution of magnetization of each atom to a chosen band. The magnetization of each atom must satisfy the symmetry of the intersection of the site symmetry group and little point group of the considered momentum 
 <bold>k</bold>. If the resulting symmetry group is non-pseudo-polar, the local spin polarizations also vanish on the chosen atom. Otherwise, local spin polarizations could survive. We find that both situations can occur [GaAs (see below) and SnI
 <sub>4</sub> (see Supplementary NoteÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) are representative of the two cases, respectively].
