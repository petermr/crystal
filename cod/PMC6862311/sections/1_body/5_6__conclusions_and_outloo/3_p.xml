<p>AXCCA is a basic analysis tool which is capable to quantitatively characterize the angular anisotropy of the X-ray diffraction patterns and relate this anisotropy to the structural properties of the system under investigation. Originally, AXCCA was used for the analysis of SAXS diffraction patterns from solution of bioparticles to obtain additional information on the structure of an individual particle [

 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The combination of AXCCA with X-ray microscopy using a micro- or even nanofocused X-ray beam gives information not only on the local order in the system, but also reveals how this local order changes depending on the spatial position in the system.
