<p>Intuitively, the structures observed for 
 <bold>3‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>3‐π</bold> suggest that they are formed through the reaction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> with isomers 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> of 
 <bold>1</bold>, respectively. This conclusion is further supported by 
 <sup>31</sup>P{
 <sup>1</sup>H} spectra of the crude product mixture, which indicate the formation of 
 <bold>3‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>3‐π</bold> in the same 2:1 ratio observed for the equilibrium between 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> (vide supra). To provide more conclusive evidence, DFT studies were performed to establish the mechanisms of formation of both 
 <bold>3‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>3‐π</bold> (see the Supporting Information). As expected, interaction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> with 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> was calculated to lead to formation of 
 <bold>3‐σ</bold>, with only a very small energy barrier of 3.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Interaction with 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> was calculated to lead to 
 <bold>3‐π</bold> over a similarly small barrier (5.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). Notably, both barriers are significantly lower than the barrier to isomerisation between 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> (vide supra).
