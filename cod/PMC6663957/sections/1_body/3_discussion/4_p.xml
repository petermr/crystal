<p id="Par60">On the other hand, the result of COV indicates that applying normalization correction introduces a noise into the image reconstructed by the block model. The reason is the limited statistics per LOR. Equation (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) shows that the uncertainty of a given voxel value increases corresponding to the number of bins contributing in calculation of that voxel, as well as the uncertainty of the normalization factors (3.2%). By increasing the statistics, the uncertainty in normalization factors decreases, and therefore, the noise introduced by normalization decreases. As an alternative, component-based methods could be used to find normalization factors with lower statistics. To investigate the effect of statistics on the image uniformity, we calculated the normalization factors with one-tenth of the current statistics. The reconstructed images using these normalization factors are much noisier. The COV for the lower statistics case is 42.8% compared to 20.9% calculated for the higher statistics case.
