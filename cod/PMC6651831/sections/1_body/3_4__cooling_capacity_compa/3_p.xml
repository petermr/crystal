<p>The results in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> present both maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T as well as the maximum cooling capacity (∆T
 <sub>max</sub>) for composites with different anisotropic components and configurations using the derived mathematical model. It can be seen that, for composites which consist of the same combination of component materials but under different configurations, the alignment of component material’s property axis in the composite has a major influence on Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T as well as the ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values. For Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub>/Copper composite, the difference in thermoelectric performances caused by the alignment of the anisotropic component’s property axis was 50%. For the SnSe/Copper composite, this difference exceeded 400%. This difference was caused by the variance of properties among different material property axes in the anisotropic component phase, where larger variance usually leads to bigger variance in the Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values of a composite.
