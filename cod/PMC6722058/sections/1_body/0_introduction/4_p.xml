<p id="Par6">The data on atomically precise structures of MPCs, combined with an ever-growing number measurements of their physico-chemical properties, collectively contains valuable chemical information on the atomic bonding and structure-property relations of these nanomaterials, which could be used for successful structural predictions of yet unknown nanoparticles. Here, we devise and demonstrate a general method for predicting metal-ligand interface structures of an unknown ligand-protected metal nanocluster. Our method is based on a local search algorithm that uses information about the known local atomic environments at the metal-ligand interface of reference nanostructures in the same class of hybrid nanoparticles. The specific example systems discussed in this work comprise gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoclusters protected by thiols (SR), phosphines (PR
 <sub>3</sub>) and diphosphines (DPPY), and we demonstrate how experimentally verified Au/Ag-thiolate and Ag-phosphine interface structures can be successfully built when the positions of all Au or Ag atoms in the cluster are first defined. However, the method itself is general and can be used for any type of nanoparticle or nanostructure if enough reference structural information is available in the same class of systems. The set of reference structures can be considered as a training set and the whole procedure to refine the candidates for the metal-ligand interfacial structures may be considered as an analogue to applying machine learning methodology to the structure prediction problem
