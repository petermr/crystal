  <p>DORI isosurface (DORI(
   <bold>r</bold>) = 
   <italic>f</italic>) of BCA at high pressure is shown for 
   <italic>f</italic> = 0.999 with 28 detected merging points associated with the 14 covalent C–C bonds. Each carbon–carbon bond can be assimilated to three growing basins (e.g., between C1 and C2) that merge into one (e.g., between C10 and C11). The first point that connects two basins is selected as their merging point. The top-right corner is a reminder of the underlying BCA molecule.
