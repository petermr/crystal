<p id="Par29">Several phantoms were simulated inside this scanner using Gate v7.2. The first one was a rotating plane (32 mm × 120 mm) source simulated to find the normalization correction factors. The plane was rotated at six equally spaced angles over a total of 180°. Since the scanner has 12 modules of detector blocks, this assures that the number of detected LORs, which are orthogonal to the plane, is maximized. The source activity was set to 10 MBq at each angular position. The acquisition time was 80 min per position. We used back-to-back emission of two 511-keV gammas, thus, the non-collinearity and positron range was not simulated in this set of data. The plane was filled with air to avoid scatter and attenuation effects. The decay was turned off. This increases the statistics per detector pair and therefore reduces the statistical error introduced by the normalization.</p>
