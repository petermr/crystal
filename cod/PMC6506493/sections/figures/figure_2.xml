  <p>Excitation spectra along 
   <italic>H</italic> or 
   <italic>K</italic> directions. 
   <bold>a</bold> Energy-momentum maps of the scattering intensities along the (
   <italic>H</italic>, 0) direction (shown above) compared with the dispersion relations of Eq. (
   <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) (below). The common color scale is used for Fig. 2a–c. Intensity is integrated for the 
   <italic>K</italic> range shown in the figure (Δ
   <italic>K</italic> = ±0.10) and the entire observed 
   <italic>L</italic> range. The branch along the (0, 
   <italic>K</italic>) direction is observed, as well as that along the (
   <italic>H</italic>, 0) direction because of crystallographic domains. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> The same maps along (
   <italic>H</italic>, −1/2) and (
   <italic>H</italic>, −1) directions and the corresponding dispersion relations. The same color scale is used for all the maps. The presented data are collected at 0.3 K with an incident energy 
   <italic>E</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>i</italic>
   </sub> of 5.92 meV. Thick solid and thin dashed curves indicate triplon bands with a large and small structure factor, respectively. 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold> Expected triplon bands without and with an alternation in interdimer interactions along the (
   <italic>H</italic>, 0) and (0, 
   <italic>K</italic>) directions. Arrows indicate a crossing point of two triplon bands when the alternation is absent. 
   <bold>f</bold> Intensity plotted as a function of energy transfer 
   <italic>E</italic> at selected reciprocal space points (
   <italic>H</italic>, 0) and (0, 
   <italic>K</italic>) in Fig. 2a. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
