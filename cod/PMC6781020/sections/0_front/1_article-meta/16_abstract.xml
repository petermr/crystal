 <p>Tin oxide quantum dots were synthesized in aqueous solution via a simple hydrolysis and oxidation process. The morphology observation showed that the quantum dots had an average grain size of 2.23 nm. The rutile phase SnO
  <sub>2</sub> was confirmed by the structural and compositional characterization. The fluorescence spectroscopy of quantum dots was used to detect the heavy metal ions of Cd
  <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
  <sup>3+</sup>, Ni
  <sup>2+</sup> and Pb
  <sup>2+</sup>, which caused the quenching effect of photoluminescence. The quantum dots showed the response of 2.48 to 100 ppm Ni
  <sup>2+</sup>. The prepared SnO
  <sub>2</sub> quantum dots exhibited prospective in the detection of heavy metal ions in contaminated water, including deionized water, deionized water with Fe
  <sup>3+</sup>, reclaimed water and sea water. The limit of detection was as low as 0.01 ppm for Ni
  <sup>2+</sup> detection. The first principle calculation based on the density function theory demonstrated the dependence of fluorescence response on the adsorption energy of heavy metal ions as well as ion radius. The mechanism of fluorescence response was discussed based on the interaction between Sn vacancies and Ni
  <sup>2+</sup> ions. A linear correlation of fluorescence emission intensity against Ni
  <sup>2+</sup> concentration was obtained in the logarithmic coordinates. The density of active Sn vacancies was the crucial factor that determined fluorescence response of SnO
  <sub>2</sub> QDs to heavy metal ions.
