<p>Among the five CL-20 cocrystals, CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O had the lowest TRR = 5.3 K/fs, while the other EMs had their TRR values in the range of 8.0â€“8.8 K/fs, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. At the same time, the trigger bond strength of CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O was also the highest, which was

 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Therefore, CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O was able to obtain the lowest shock sensitivity among the five cocrystals.
