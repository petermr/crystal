 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> b shows the fragments of the XRD patterns on an enlarged scale, illustrating the successive transition from the phase R1 to the phase R2 and then to the phase R3. It is clear that the phase R1 is maintained up to 353 K, at 363 K the peak of the phase R2 appears with the parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> = 61.83 Å, the phases R1 and R2 coexist in the interval 353 &lt; 
 <italic>T</italic> &lt; 383 K. At 383 K, only the intermediate phase R2 remains, at 393 K, traces of the high-temperature phase R3 appear (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> b). With the increase in temperature, the amount of the latter increases and above 448 K NCN0.25 completely passes into the R3 phase. At room temperature, 15 h after the measurements, two phases were present in NCN0.25 — high-temperature R3 and a small amount of the low-temperature phase R1 (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> a). It should be noted that the intermediate phase R2 was absent at room temperature, regardless of the temperature from which the sample had been cooled, 423 K or 523 K, it was important that cooling occurred from the high-temperature phase R3. Seven days after the temperature measurements, NCN0.25 still remained two-phase – R1 + R3, but the R1 phase prevailed, and after 3 weeks the sample completely returned to the R1 phase.
