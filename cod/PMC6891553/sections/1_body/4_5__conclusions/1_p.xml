<p>In this work, we presented a mixed photogrammetric-acoustic technique to carefully analyze, together with the design and construction of a scale wind tunnel, the attenuation behavior and the permeability to sand of a new type of acoustic barriers based on periodic arrays of scatterers, usually called sonic crystal acoustic screens. In contrast to the non-permeability properties of classic barriers, the screens based on sonic crystal allow permeability to wind and water, but until now, no one has analyzed the sand permeability and its influence on sound attenuation. This situation is especially interesting for infrastructures located in desert soils. </p>
