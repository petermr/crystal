 <sub>3</sub> NCs, namely employing DDAX as the sole ligand in the hot-injection synthesis. With its C
 <sub>12</sub>-hydrocarbon chains, this ligand is considerably shorter than OLA and OA (C
 <sub>18</sub>), favoring the application of such NCs in LEDs. Green-emissive LEDs exhibit a peak EQE of 9.8% and brightness of 34700 Cd/m
 <sup>2</sup> and are, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient devices based on CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs. Application of double hole-transporting layers and additional hole-blocking layers afforded efficient blue LEDs (EQE = 1–5% at EL peaks of 460–500 nm). Future work should focus on the maximization of PLQY values of the NCs before integration into the LEDs. Another highly promising venue is solid-state chemical treatment, e.g. by dipping the films of DDAX-capped NCs into solutions of diverse chemical species, which could allow for passivation of the trap states.
