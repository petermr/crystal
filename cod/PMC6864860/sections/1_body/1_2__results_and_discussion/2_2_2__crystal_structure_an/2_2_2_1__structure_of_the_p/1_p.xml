<p>The single crystal of PROG-CNA was obtained by the evaporation method from a mixed solvent of EtOH/water (1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) containing a 1:1 molar ratio of PROG and CNA. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the expected crystal structure of PROG-CNA in 1:1 molecular stoichiometry was successfully obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The final residual factor, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.0375, was acceptable. Moreover, the PROG-CNA co-crystal belongs to the orthorhombic system and has an achiral space group of 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>2
 <sub>1</sub>2
 <sub>1</sub>, due to the chiral structure of PROG.
