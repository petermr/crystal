<p id="Par16">The production of hydrogen 
 <italic>in operando</italic> and its likely highly reversible adsorption to the catalyst surface seems to correspond well with our experimental observations. Hence we chose hydrogen adsorption on Te as the starting point for our DFT analysis. To explain the nature of the adsorption process as hydrogen evolution progresses at the surface of 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> and to probe deeper into the role of the hydrogen-ion adsorption on the electrochemical process, the 2 × 2 supercell of a monolayer slab was adapted as the working model of 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Discussion for more details). The band structure and density of states reveal metallic behaviour with a Fermi level at −4.326 eV (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>). This behaviour is due to mild deviation of Mo atoms leading to shorter Mo–Mo bonds (295 pm) as the electronic structure analysis reveals. The recurring zig-zag arrangement of Mo atoms and the symmetry of the crystal frontier orbitals in the Fermi region (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref>) hint at the possibility of a μ
 <sup>3</sup>-H bridging mode upon H atom insertion since there is sufficient nesting space for it (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). It is therefore worthwhile to explore the possibility of formation of a tri-haptic metal hydride which we called the η-site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We examined the viability and positions on the chemisorption energy scale for the three alternative regio-isomers (α, β, and ε) at a surface coverage of 12.5% (in line with the coverage expected from the experimental values of the exchange current density). For the discussion of the regio-isomers of H-adsorption sites, we adopted the nomenclature proposed in a recent computational study on H-atom binding on 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub>

 </sup>. The main structural features of these isomers are compared with the proposed η-isomer as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23</xref>. The tri-haptic ligating mode shows a minimum on the potential energy surface attested by partial Hessian calculations yielding real values for the normal modes of the newly formed bonds. As predicted from qualitative arguments this new structure displays equal distances to all three metals (Supplementary Discussion). The energy of hydrogen uptake Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> = +0.58 eV is slightly lower (less endothermic) than on the α-site (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The two remaining isomers (β and ε) display substantially higher Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>, which is in line with the ligation energy trend reported before (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>). Therefore, we restrict the following discussion to α-isomers and η-isomers only.
