<p>A typical Mn-O1 bond distance, in the layer of the analyzed materials, falls between 1.088–2.352 Å and 1.860 Å for Mn4 and Mn8 materials, respectively. The presence of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup>, in both the high- and low-spin states, as was evidenced by AOS (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), was confirmed by the four short and two long Mn–O distances, which resulted from Jahn–Teller distortion. The Jahn–Teller distortion has important implications for the electrical conductivity of these materials. The Mn–O bond distances are in close agreement with those reported by Drits et al. [
