<p id="Par15">On the other hand, the two oxidation peaks of the α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction finally converge into one peak (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,e</xref>) under three-electrode system and two-electrode system, this may due to the enhanced synergy between α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> materials. To contrast the change further, the CV curves at sweep rate with 10 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction electrode materials in three-electrode system and two-electrode system are exhibited in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,f</xref>, respectively. Obviously, the coordinates of the oxidation peak and the reduction peak in their CV are shifted to the left, which can be considered as the result of the coordination between the two materials. Different from α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction, there are two pairs of clear redox peaks for α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> in three-electrode system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The first pair peaks are present at 0.21 V and the second pair peaks are located at 0.47 V and 0.38 V, which are corresponding to the processes of the reaction Eqs (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>), respectively. However, α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction electrode materials only display a pair peaks, which due to internal α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> material is not activated and the corresponding current is low. When the scanning speed is increased, the two oxidation peaks can be observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), which may be attributed to excitation of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>.
