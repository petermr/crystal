<p>As discussed previously, the spacing between the twin planes varies along the length of the NW, being always shorter at the bottom than near the tip. This feature is especially appealing because it gives access to TSLs with different periods within a single NW. It is worth mentioning here that the probed region of the NW is limited to the laser spot size, and therefore at the two NW ends we probe phonons arising from a constant TSL period. Our computed Raman spectra predict the possibility of tuning the number and intensity of the spectral features with wavenumbers beyond the TO by controlling the period of the TSL. This is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a, where we compare the computed Raman spectrum of a TSL with a period of 9 nm (the same of 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>a) with another with a shorter period of 4 nm. As expected, a shorter period results in fewer peaks.
