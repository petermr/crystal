<p>The occurrence of magic numbers in nanoclusters has to do primarily with the formation of shells of atoms upon a fundamental cell. When the number of atoms completes a full shell, we find a unique set of numbers, termed “magic,” that defines the shells of atoms. A cluster is represented by a graph with the atoms as vertices and the bonds as edges. It consists of nested shells like layers of an onion. We define the numbers of layers as 
 <italic>n</italic> and discover the mathematical relationships of nearest neighbor coordination numbers, bonds, the total number of atoms, and some topological indices as a function of 
 <italic>n</italic>. The original paper by van Hardeveld and Hartog [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] considered fcc, bcc, and hcp clusters. The reference by Teo and Sloane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] considers polyhedra and Platonic solids but neglects the relationship of nearest neighbor coordination numbers. We add to this database by looking at simple cubic, diamond cubic, and the Platonic solids, in addition to the topological properties and dispersion of the clusters.
