<p>Uncommon behavior for the magnetoresistance is observed (

 </xref>C). At low temperatures, the material’s resistivity ρ
 <sub>
  <italic>xx</italic>
 </sub> shows a domelike feature when magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the basal plane (i.e., along 
 <italic>z</italic>). At 2 K, it decreases by about 9.4 μΩ cm when the field increased from 0 to about 4.1 T, this latter field being where

 <italic>H</italic> saturates at the same temperature (

 </xref>A). This behavior is consistent with the anomalous magnetoresistance seen in spin flop systems. The field-dependent resistivity is not quenched until temperatures above 40 K, above the magnetic ordering temperature—the magnetoresistance becomes more normal for temperatures of 70 K and above. Measurements on a second sample suggest that the magnetoresistance in a direction perpendicular to the plane is positive and significantly larger than what is observed in-plane (see

Further, the out-of-plane resistivity does not appear to saturate by 9 T and may continue to rise with larger applied fields. Although the in-plane magnetoresistance is reminiscent of that observed for WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, the change of resistivity in field is orders of magnitude lower than is seen there, and magnetic moments (from the Eu) are actually present in the current case, while they are absent for WTe
