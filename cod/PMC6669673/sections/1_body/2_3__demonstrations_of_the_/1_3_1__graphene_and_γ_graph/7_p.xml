 </inline-formula> the free energy of graphene and γ-graphyne on Cu (111) was calculated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00978-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), showing that the free energy of graphene is always smaller than that of γ-graphyne in the temperature range from 100 K to 3000 K. The difference at 100 K, 321 eV, decreased gradually down to 267 eV with the temperature increasing up to 3000 K, indicating that graphene should be more easily grown than γ-graphyne on a Cu (111) surface via depositing C atoms. We also calculated the free energy on a Ni (111) surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00978-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) using the same method and found that graphene still owned smaller free energy than γ-graphyne, although the difference at 100 K, 318 eV, became gradually small with the temperature. These results are consistent with previous experimental observations [
