<p id="Par21">CSE is efficient also for predicting the true structures for protected Ag-clusters as can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> for the four studied cases. Similarly to Au-clusters, the model structures that have the smallest CSE values include most probably the true structure. It is interesting to note that even for the clusters with mixed ligand layers of thiolates and phosphines the true Agâ€“S part of the overall interface conformation can be predicted before addition of the phosphines or diphosphines. This enables prediction of the overall conformations of the metal-ligand interfaces in steps, first for the ligands that are in majority and then continuing the process with the ligands in minority for the best structures. Completing the prediction with phosphines and diphosphines is described next.
