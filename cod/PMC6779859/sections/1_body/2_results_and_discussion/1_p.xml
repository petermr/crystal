<p>The diagonalization of Ä¤ in Equation (1) provides the eight energies 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>l</italic>
 </sub> of the ground 
 <italic>S</italic> = 7/2 multiplet of 
 <bold>1</bold> as a function of 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub>, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Despite Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ion has a ground 
 <italic>S</italic> = 7/2 multiplet with a ground orbital angular momentum 
 <italic>L</italic> = 0, there exists a non-zero overall energy splitting (~20 GHz) at 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> = 0. As expected from an ion whose contribution to the ground angular momentum is purely spin, 
 <bold>1</bold> should be rather insensitive to the ligand environment. This would result in an isotropic low-lying Zeeman energy scheme independent of the field direction, with eight degenerate energies at 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> = 0.
