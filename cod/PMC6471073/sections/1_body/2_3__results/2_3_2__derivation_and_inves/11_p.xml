<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f014">Figure 14</xref>a, it can be seen that for a DRG with a certain diameter, the natural frequency is linear with relation to the ring width, while it has slight dependence on the other geometrical parameters. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f014">Figure 14</xref>b,c, it can be learnt that the effective mass and Coriolis mass of the DRG are approximately linear with the ring width and the ring number. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f014">Figure 14</xref>d shows that the ring width has no influence on the angular gain of the DRG and the angular gain will be stable about 0.396 when the ring number is 10 or more. The changing rules can be used in the design of the DRG.
