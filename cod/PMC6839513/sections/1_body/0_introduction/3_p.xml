<p>For active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or simple drugs, thin film fabrication technologies have not yet been used extensively, as upscaling into mass production might require fabrication processes distinct from already established ones. For the sake of finding new polymorphs of drugs with the intention of reaching better solubility or overcoming patent issues, different film deposition techniques have been employed, including spin coating,

 </sup> drop casting, inkjet printing, solution shearing,

 </sup> dip coating, and vacuum deposition among others. The drug dissolution from such layers is often faster compared to bulk systems. On the one hand, this results from larger surface areas being present in the thin films
