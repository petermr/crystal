<p>Photolysis of PetACrONO was carried out in isobutyronitrile solution. The NO release was determined by entraining the photolysis solution contained in a “Y” cell with medical-grade air, which then flowed to a Sievers Nitric Oxide Analyzer (NOA, GE model NOA-280i), where it was detected and quantified via a calibrated chemiluminescence technique (SI

(In each case, the entraining gas was purged through a solvent bubbler prior to entering the photolysis cell to reduce evaporative losses.) The photoexcitation source was either the 365 nm emission from a 200 W high-pressure mercury lamp isolated with an interference filter or the 451 nm light from a Luxeon blue light-emitting diode (LED) (SI

 </sup> while those at 451 nm were determined with a power meter (Newport model 8442 PE). Excitation intervals were controlled using a Uniblitz shutter, and quantum yields of NO release (Φ
 <sub>NO</sub>) were determined by evaluating the NO released and recorded using the NOA software (“Liquid”) for varied excitation intervals. The slope of a plot of NO released vs total light absorbed by the solution gives Φ
