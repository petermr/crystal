<p>In summary, we were able to isolate and characterize the very sensitive complex 
 <bold>2</bold>, containing the unprecedented parent diarsene HAs=AsH as side‐on coordinating ligand, which is stabilized in the coordination sphere of a mononuclear Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub> fragment without further stabilization by bulky organic substituents. Although 
 <bold>2</bold> is highly sensitive and only stable at low temperatures, it could be comprehensively characterized. DFT calculations show that 
 <bold>2</bold> is best described as an olefin‐like complex in which the As=As double bond character is preserved. Further, the initial reactivity of 
 <bold>2</bold> towards Lewis acids was investigated leading to new products containing As−H ligands. Among others, complex 
 <bold>3</bold> is the first structurally proved representative containing a planar Fe
 <sub>2</sub>As
 <sub>2</sub> unit.
