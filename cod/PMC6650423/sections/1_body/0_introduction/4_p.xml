<p id="Par6">Here, by measuring the in-plane magnetic susceptibility anisotropy with exceptionally precise torque magnetometry, we report thermodynamic signatures of a nematic phase transition at 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup> of Hg1201. Importantly, the observed twofold in-plane anisotropy below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup> indicates that the nematic director in Hg1201 orients along the diagonal direction of the CuO
 <sub>2</sub> square lattice. Furthermore, the enhancement of the diagonal nematicity with decreasing temperature is suppressed around the temperature at which short-range CDW formation occurs. These results suggest a competing relationship between diagonal nematic and CDW order, shedding light on the pseudogap physics in cuprates.
