<p id="Par10">To understand the role of PEACl, we studied phase composition of the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film by performing XRD measurements. The XRD pattern of PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film in Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows mixed phases of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2, and 
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 3 perovskites, and each peak is indexed. Most XRD peaks of the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film can be assigned to 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 phase, based on reported XRD pattern of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbBr
 <sub>4</sub> single crystal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. The XRD peak intensity of the 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 phase is much stronger than the other phases, indicating 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 layered phase may prefer to lay down in parallel to the substrate. The Cl:Br ratio in 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 layered phase is estimated to be 1:4, based on the XRD and PL peak positions, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>. The XRD peak at 4.3° is most likely from 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 phase, based on the analysis of lattice constants. The XRD diffraction peak of 
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 3 phase locates at a larger diffraction angle of 31.1° than (202) plane of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (30.7°), whereas it is very close to the (202) plane of 3D perovskite with a composition of CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub>, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>. Hereinafter, we refer the 
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 3 phase in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film as a 3D phase. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, the PL spectrum from PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film at room temperature only has one emission peak around 489 nm. Reducing the temperature to 173 K leads to two additional peaks in the PL spectrum at 392 nm and 419 nm, which are most likely from 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 phases, respectively

 </sup>. The PL emission around 490 nm in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) perovskite films should be from the 3D phase with a composition approximately CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub>. The absorbance spectrum of PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> also shows two obvious peaks at 390 nm and 418 nm, which are close to the PL emission peaks of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 phases, respectively.
