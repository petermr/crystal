<p>The water molecules in the montmorillonite layers were added using the adsorption location module. Since the number of water molecules affects the interlayer spacing of montmorillonite, and when the interlayer cation of montmorillonite is Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, the interlayer spacing is about 15 Å. So, we added 256 water molecules in layers of the four kinds of montmorillonite. After geometric optimization, the c value of the four kinds of montmorillonite were 15.4152 Å,15.4203 Å, 15.4126 Å, and 15.4134 Å, respectively, which was basically consistent with the measured d
 <sub>(001)</sub> value by XRD (
