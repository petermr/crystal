 <sub>2</sub>. In the second stage, GW (G–Green function and W–Coulomb interactions) approximations are used to calculate the quasi-particle energies. The GW function fails to calculate the excitonic effect between electron-hole interactions. The electron-hole interactions are then included beyond GW approximations, and the BSE method is employed in order to get improved dielectric function for TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub>. To shed light on the accuracy of the BSE method, we calculated the absorption coefficient for silicon and compared with the corresponding experimental results. In
