<p id="Par20">As commented in the introduction two main differences appear between ABP and AOUP active forces: the fluctuating norm of the AOUP force
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>, and the higher order correlations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup> which make the ABP force non-Gaussian. We will explore in the following if these differences (and which) are relevant for active cluster crystals.
