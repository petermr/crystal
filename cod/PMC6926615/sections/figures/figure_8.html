 <caption> Lasing in lead-free perovskite materials. ( a) Optical image of a butterfly scale from the white part of the wing. Inset is a photograph of the butterfly. ( b) SEM image showing lamellae (vertical structures) in the scale. ( c) Variable fluence measurements reveal the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds of the SnF 2-treated samples. ( d) Wide PL and ASE wavelength tunability from CsSnBr xI 3−x films fabricated by facile mixing the precursor solutions under 500 nm pump pulses (50 fs, 1 kHz). ( e) A comparison of the PL, ASE, and single-mode lasing of CsSnI 3 (20% SnF 2) under 650 nm pump pulses (50 fs, 1 kHz). Reproduced with permission [ 126]. Copyright WILEY-VCH Verlag, GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany, 2016. ( f) Variation in PL intensity and FWHM with pumped energy. ( g) Thermal tunability of the AIPQD−CLC laser at E = 5.0 μJ/pulse at 20, 25, 30, 40, and 45 °C. ( h) Tuning of the lasing emission of AIPQD−CLC laser by changing the chiral dopant content in the CLC. ( i) Electrical tunability of the AIPQD−CLC laser at E = 4.0 μJ/pulse under AC voltages of 0−20 V (1 kHz). Reproduced with permission [ 127]. Copyright American Chemical Society, 2018. </caption>
