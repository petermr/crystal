<p id="Par22">ToF-SIMS was performed on selected compositions to evaluate the degree of interdiffusion between layers. Blanket film stacks reproducing the stack on the selected locations were prepared for the ToF-SIMS measurement. The ToF-SIMS (ToF-SIMS 5, ION-TOF GmbH) measurements were conducted with a Bi
 <sup>+</sup> pulsed primary ion beam (30 keV) for the analysis and O
 <sup>2+</sup> beam for sputtering. The non-interlaced mode was used, with 3 s of sputtering before each data point was collected. The analysis area was centred inside the O
 <sup>2+</sup> raster area. Because the erosion rate varies with materials quite significantly, even for the same material before and after annealing, the thickness of each layer cannot be determined simply based on the sputtering time unless carefully calibrated.
