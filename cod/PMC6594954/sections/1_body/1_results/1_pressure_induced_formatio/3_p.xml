<p id="Par8">The unexpected response of the crystal structure on pressure treatment is observed above 7.5 GPa. While the 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> axes continue to decrease, the 
 <italic>a</italic>-axis reveals an anomalous increase upon compression indicating a change in the compression mechanism (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Indeed half of the TO
 <sub>4</sub> units start to undergo pressure-induced geometrical distortion. The progressive deviation of P1O
 <sub>4</sub> and Be2O
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra from the ideal tetrahedral geometry above ~7.5 GPa is perfectly visible on plots showing quadratic elongation and bond angular variance parameters as a function of pressure

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Such a distortion results from the closure of eight-membered rings and progressive approach of the fifth oxygen to the P1 and Be2 atoms across the rings (Supplementary Fig.
