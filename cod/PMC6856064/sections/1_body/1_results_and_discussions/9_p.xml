 <sub>11</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>12</sub> values were below 95 for the PKG-1-1UV2B-GR LED PKG because the emission wavelength of the blue-chip was around 452 nm. The blue-chip used in the PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LED PKG emits light with a peak wavelength of 455 nm. It is because of the peak emission of 455 nm from this blue-chip; we could achieve all the CRI points &gt;95.
