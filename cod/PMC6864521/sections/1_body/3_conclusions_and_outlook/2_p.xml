<p>The Cd‐based light‐emitting nanocrystals have been thoroughly explored, and the current state of art for the synthesis of these materials allow us to achieve PL QY ≈100% and FWHM of the emission ≈30 nm, both highly suitable for display applications. However, because of the limitations on Cd toxicity, several markets have imposed severe limitations on the use of these materials in consumer products. Currently, the concentration of Cd in displays is restricted to 0.2 µg mm
 <sup>−2</sup> by the 
 <italic>EU RoHS2</italic> directive. We note that the Cd concentration for the existing QREF is ≈0.05 µg mm
 <sup>−2</sup>, which is already below the limit stated in the 
 <italic>EU RoHS2</italic> directive. However, it would be highly desirable to avoid the cadmium completely or find a way to reduce the concentration of Cd well below the limit to avoid any potential risk for humans and environment. On the other hand, stability of the Cd‐based nanocrystals in an open environment is not the main issue for QDEF and QREFs, because mostly they are well encapsulated in the polymer films and their stability is thus greatly enhanced.
