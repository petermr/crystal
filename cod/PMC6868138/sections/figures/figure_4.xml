  <p>Reorientation of spiral droplets in response to light. 
   <bold>a</bold> Three-dimensional motion of a droplet incorporating Me-
   <bold>m</bold> motor. Upon strong illumination, the helix inversion operates a sharp reorientation. 
   <bold>b</bold> A sharp directional change is operated by the spiral droplets upon helix inversion. A chiral droplet follows a right-handed helical trajectory (in blue) and upon strong illumination helix inversion in the droplet inverts the handedness of the trajectory (in red) and modifies the direction of droplet motion. The direction of reorientation is characterized by the angle 
   <italic>θ</italic>. 
   <bold>c</bold> Two-dimensional trajectory of a droplet that undergoes directional change upon rapid helix inversion. The angle 
   <italic>θ</italic> is defined as the angle between the helical axis of motion before (black arrow) and after illumination (red arrow). 
   <bold>d</bold> Measured reorientation angle 
   <italic>θ</italic> for 
   <italic>N</italic> = 32. These angle values are meaningful only between 0 and 180, which means that a cone of deterministic reorientation is associated to each reorientation angle 
   <italic>θ</italic>. 
   <bold>e</bold>, Dependence of 
   <italic>θ</italic> from the chirality confinement ratio 
   <italic>N</italic>. The angle of photo-stimulated re-direction increases with 
   <italic>N</italic>. The error bars indicate standard deviation, the dashed line is a guide for the eye
