<p>At this point, it is instructive to have a closer look at the evolution of the icosahedral units across this sequence (shown in 
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>
 </xref>). For the rhombohedral structures, their local symmetry is 
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>3
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub>. To compare disordered α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, mass-weighed average coordinates were employed for the polar position. As introduced earlier, going from α-B
 <sub>12</sub> to B
 <sub>6</sub>P replaces intericosahedral 3c2c bonding by exo-bonding to P
 <sub>2</sub> dumbbells. Naturally, this expands the exo-bond length between polar atoms considerably, as well as widens the distances between polar atoms within the icosahedron (i.e., enlarges the polar triangles of the icoahedron). Going from B
 <sub>6</sub>P to α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> then leads to highly strained icosahedra. The significantly larger skeleton Si–B distances also cause the (skeleton) B
 <sup>e</sup>–B
 <sup>e</sup> distances being considerably widened compared to B
 <sub>12</sub> (from 1.78 to 1.85 Å). In orthorhombic β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, icosahedral units attain a local 
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub> symmetry and consisting exclusively of B atoms, which distribute over four crystallographic sites. The distinction between polar and equatorial sites (which is based on rhombohedral symmetry) is not respected. One can note that the skeleton B–B distances are considerably larger compared to α-B
 <sub>12</sub> and B
 <sub>6</sub>P. This holds especially true for the B4–B4 distances (which exceed 1.9 Å). At the same time, the length of B4–B4 exo-bonds, connecting neighboring icosahedra, corresponds very well to the exo-bond length in B
 <sub>6</sub>P (1.72 vs 1.73 Å).
