<p id="Par26">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, the differential displacement map of the relaxed atomic coordinates through energy minimization is shown. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, the displacement of atoms in the core region of the screw dislocation is found to be non-planar, which is different than in the case of MgO. Detailed disregistry analysis (not shown) suggests that the screw dislocation has a center on the O atom. Near the core region, we choose six U sites to consider as the creation sites for a U vacancy, labeled 1–6 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the vacancy segregation energy to the dislocation core sites for a localized vacancy structure are listed. They range from −0.49 to −1.14 eV. For site 5, a spontaneous relaxation (without heating) into a jog structure is obtained. However, the jog structure obtained is a metastable state since, upon heating, it further relaxes into a lower energy configuration. Therefore, we use the next lowest energy site, site 4, as the reference site for subsequent energy comparisons.
