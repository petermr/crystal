<p id="Par16">Concerning the second question, the neutron scan of ‘crystal a’ along the [00 L] direction shows clear evidence of disorder, with a rather broadened peak around the (0 0 0) point and a substantial ‘shoulder’ feature extending nearly to the [001] point (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). While there are many possible sources of such disorder, ranging from vacancies and anti-site defects to small grain sizes, here we explore the idea that 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis strain in ‘crystal a’ is ultimately responsible for the rather broad neutron diffraction peaks. The hypothesis here is that nanoscale 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis strain could significantly change the interlayer magnetic coupling, since this coupling is known from previous work

 </sup> to depend rather substantially on pressure, or equivalently compression or expansion of the cell from the equilibrium value. The interlayer coupling is of course necessary to attain a finite ordering temperature, given the Mermin-Wagner finding that truly low-dimensional systems do not order at finite temperature. Since, as in many materials, the interlayer coupling here is relatively weak, it is plausible that nanoscale 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis strain could change the coupling, which generally falls off quickly with increased distance.
