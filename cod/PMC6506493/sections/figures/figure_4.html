 <caption> Scattering intensities sliced with the constant energy. Intensity is given at a 2.48, b 2.60, and c 2.72 meV for each ( H, K) or ( K, H) position after integrated for Δ E = ±0.06 meV and all measured L values. The common color scale is used. White solid curves indicate boundaries between zero and nonzero intensity regions expected from the dispersion relation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file </caption>
