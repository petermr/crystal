<p>The first exfoliation of graphene [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] attracted extensive interest in 2D materials such as black phosphorus (BP) [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a common chemical formula MX
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to the many excellent electronic, mechanical and optoelectronic properties, TMDCs are highly attractive for fundamental studies of novel physical phenomena and for applications ranging from electronics [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and photonics [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] to sensing [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and actuation [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] at the nanoscale.
