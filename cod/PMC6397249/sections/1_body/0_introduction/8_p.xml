<p id="Par9">Using this concept, Au-based MGMCs with controlled color were designed with an ultra-fine visually-unresolved microstructure comprised of dendrites of primary-Au having the fcc structure of pure gold dispersed in a metallic glass matrix. The alloying additions to the primary-Au are chosen to produce Au-rich solid solutions having color varying from yellow, to red, rose, or green, etc., depending on the concentration of these alloy additions. As such, the dendrites may exhibit “yellow gold”, “rose gold” or other standard gold colors determined by control of the concentration of the dissolved solute metals in primary-Au. As the solubility of Si is very low in primary-Au, Si will strongly partition to the liquid matrix during the growth of primary-Au dendrites in the semisolid. Owing to this strong partitioning, the primary-Au dendrites will be essentially Si-free and display mechanical, optical, and color properties determined by the concentration of solute dissolved in primary-Au. While the metallic glass matrix may appear optically white, the primary-Au dendrites may be designed to have high chromaticity by choice of the overall alloy composition and knowledge of the partitioning effect of the other solute metals. As such, the primary-Au dendrites will control the overall color of the MGMC.</p>
