<p id="Par38">The quantum efficiency (number of converted photons/number of absorbed photons in %) was measured using a QUANTAURUS-QY spectrometer (Hamamatsu, Japan) equipped with a full integrating sphere (diameter approx. 8.4 cm) and a 150 W xenon excitation light source with excitation at 460 nm. As there are slightly different definitions for internal and external quantum efficiency, it is difficult to directly compare these values for different materials. However, to the best of our knowledge the here presented value is comparable to the “internal quantum efficiency” given for Sr[LiAl
