<p id="Par12">Performing similar calculations for other excitation concentrations and [Zr, Ti] mixing allows us to investigate how the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition affect the transition temperature from crystalline to amorphous phase, and its interplay with electronic excitation concentration in the cubic pyrochlore lattice. For each composition investigated, the general trend, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(c)</xref>, is a lowering of the transition temperature as the excitation concentration increases such that each cubic compound amorphizes at room temperature for 1.2% of excitation concentration. While cubic LZO is found to be the most resistant composition to electronic excitation, a compound made of 50% Zr (i.e. La
 <sub>2</sub>ZrTiO
 <sub>7</sub>) is the easiest to amorphize as suggested by the value of its transition temperature, which is always the lowest across the range of electronic excitation concentration investigated. Interestingly, a similar trend with respect to 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition has been observed experimentally for the Gd
 <sub>2</sub>(Zr
 <sub>x</sub>Ti
 <sub>1−x</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> pyrochlore family, with the pure Gd
 <sub>2</sub>Zr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> phase being more resistant to electronic excitation than a phase made of 50% Zr fraction (i.e. Gd
 <sub>2</sub>ZrTiO
 <sub>7</sub>)

 </sup>. While for 0.4% of excitation concentration, the transition temperature is highly dependent on the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site cation composition, for 1.2% of excitation concentration the amorphization temperature starts to be composition-independent.
