<p>The morphological features of all prepared materials were investigated by taking SEM images. No differences neither in particle size nor shape were observed with the increase of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration in synthesized compounds. The representative SEM images of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO

 <sup>3+</sup> specimen are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b. The figure demonstrates that powder consists of agglomerates, which are formed from smaller crystallites with broad size range. The shape of these crystallites is mostly rod-like. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f002">Figure 2</xref>c depicts the SEM image of the surface of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) ceramic disk. The ceramic disk surface is formed from crystallites of various sizes. These crystallites are well grown together and form an even surface of the ceramic disk.
