 <sup>+</sup> cations in their trenches and are separated by single‐layers of 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sup>+</sup> cations parallel to (010). Every iron(III) cation is coordinated tetrahedrally by three 
 <italic>μ</italic>‐bridging oxide ions and one terminal hydroxide group. Thus, each of the iron‐centered tetrahedra shares three of its vertices. Any nodal connectivity of three must create a surface, here a layer. The pronounced folding of these layers, which is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the hydroxide groups, resembles the tertiary structure in proteins, in particular beta pleated sheets. The folding depends on temperature but also on the size of the alkali metal cations (radii for c.n.=8: K

 <sup>+</sup>: 161 pm, Cs
 <sup>+</sup>: 174 pm).
