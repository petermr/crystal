<p id="Par16">After heat treatment, the Ti curve became smoother, as did the Cu and Ni curves. Furthermore, the Cu and Ni peaks shifted slightly towards the Ti layer. The migration directions of Cu and Ni are random. However, the profiles are not significantly changed. The results indicated that the Ti/Cu interface appeared to serve as a barrier to block interdiffusion. Therefore, the layering sequence is another critical parameter that has a strong impact on the solid-state reaction in addition to the layer thickness.</p>
