<p>The second type of problems is related to the quantitative description of the orientational correlation of particles. This includes both, the characterization of orientational distribution of particles in solutions [

 <xref rid="B59-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] as well as the bond-orientational order in dense systems [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the latter case, studies of the bond-orientational order necessarily include interference of the scattered X-rays between several particles [

 <xref rid="B60-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], which can significantly complicate the analysis. A typical example of such a system is the hexatic phase in LCs, which will be considered in the following section.
