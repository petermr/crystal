<p>With the noticeable progress of THz sources and detectors over the past few decades, the imaging and recognition with THz radar systems becomes possible. Until now, THz radar imaging systems could be divided into three main categories: raster-scanning radar systems, mixed-scanning radar systems, and SAR/ISAR systems. A raster-scanning radar system uses several lenses to focus the beam onto a fixed area, and the image is obtained by recording the data of each scanning area when scanning along an object. One of the leading institutions in this area is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA, USA). From 2006 to 2014, they presented serious radar systems with different operating frequencies and bandwidths, and achieved sub-centimeter resolution over a 4–25 m distance [

 <xref rid="B11-sensors-19-02330" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This system allows screening at ranges of 2–10 m with sub-centimeter resolution, and can obtain an image in 10 s. The imaging frame rate of these systems is determined by the number of scanning pixels and oscillation frequency of the scanning mirrors, so it is time-consuming to acquire a target image. Furthermore, the system structure is complex and easily damaged.
