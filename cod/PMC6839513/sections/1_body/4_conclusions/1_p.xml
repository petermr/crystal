<p>The evaluation of the structure within a thin film is challenging due to different reasons. By using a combination of CSP calculations with GIXD experiments and some help from Raman spectroscopy, the structure of phenytoin in its thin film form (
 <bold>form II</bold>) could be solved. The results suggest that the difference in the steric H-bonding network is likely the reason for the faster dissolution of the surface induced thin film form (
 <bold>form II</bold>) with respect to the 
 <bold>form I</bold>, which is the bulk form. In general, the structure solving procedure employed here, with the assistance of CSP methods, allows for the use of limited experimental data to gain access to the packing arrangement of organic molecules. It can be expected that this may represent an optimal approach when dealing not only with GIXD data from thin films but could be extended to single crystal X-ray diffraction of poor data, neutron diffraction, or even electron diffraction, minimizing the requirement of high quality crystal growth.
