 <sub>0</sub> for any of the scattering vectors of the four observed reflections. This strengthened broadening confirms a heterogeneous Mg concentration in many different nano-scale grains of the metastable alloy. The yellow dots mark the minimum and maximum Mg concentrations estimated from the plots. Thus, the metastable Al alloy immediately after HPT for 100 turns contains Mg solute for a maximum of ~40 at.% where this result is in excellent agreement with the direct observation of 38.44 at.% by chemical analysis and thus the bulk nanostructured metastable Al-Mg alloy contains a supersaturation of Mg solutes. Furthermore, the range of the Mg concentration is maintained reasonably constant during natural aging in the material while the distribution shifts to stronger plateau-shaped curves.
