<p>To summarize, we have enough elements to rationalize the observation of Anh‐B in our experiments and understand that during a short interval, which corresponds to the nucleation stage, nucleation of Anh‐B can compete with the one of wadsleyite. However, one can expect, in agreement with the observed microstructure (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), that in the transition zone, growth of wadsleyite rapidly exceeds growth of Anh‐B. The situation is different if some MgO‐enriched or SiO
 <sub>2</sub>‐depleted regions exist. Several studies have suggested the existence of P‐T conditions where Anh‐B might be stable (Ganguly &amp; Frost, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Ottonello et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Yuan et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Our study shows that transformation from olivine can be facilitated due to low nucleation energy barriers. Also, one can expect that crystal preferred orientations of Anh‐B could be inherited from those of olivine (if they exist).
