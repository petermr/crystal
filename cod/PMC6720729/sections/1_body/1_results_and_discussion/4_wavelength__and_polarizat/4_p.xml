 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. The dramatic fluctuation of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ph</sub> for all the test angles can be observed from the scatter symbols. The ratio of maximum/minimum value of photosensitivity reaches up to 10.7, which is attributed to the comprehensive effect of anisotropic photoelectricity and highly confined energy dispersion in 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, the anisotropic photoresponsivity implies that 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> has great promise for future photodetector applications.
