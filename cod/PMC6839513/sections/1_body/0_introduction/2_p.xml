<p>In addition to conventional bulk (solution) crystal form screening experiments, crystallization becomes more frequently investigated under more restricted environments like pores,

 </sup> or just at solid surfaces.

 </sup> In any of those cases, the surface contact influences the nucleation. One reason might be the reduced local entropy of the system in the surface vicinity or the substrateâ€“molecule interactions reducing the overall energy due to adhesion or other interactions. Eventually, this may determine a growth process distinct from the bulk case, resulting in a different crystal habit, a distinct crystal contact plane, and/or, maybe most importantly, in otherwise inaccessible polymorphs. The latter are often labeled as surface induced

 </sup> or surface mediated phases

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
 </sup> and might be a special case of heterogeneous crystallization. The extension of the new phases is often also limited in thickness, and these are then referred to as thin film phases; the organic semiconductor pentacene is one of the most prominent and widely studied examples of thin film polymorphism.

 </sup> While such phases are often found, especially, when prepared within thin film facilitating spin coating or physical vacuum deposition, the reason for their occurrence is still not understood.
