<p>The refined atomic structure of the η″ phase in the Al-31.0 at.%Fe alloy is shown in 
 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(a</xref>). This compound possesses a long-period superlattice structure based on the parent η-phase structure (space group 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic>) with a peculiar ordered arrangement of Fe/Al atoms in the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites. While the orthorhombic unit cell of the η phase stacks along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis to form a long-period superlattice unit cell of the η″ phase (M = 19 for Al-31 at.%Fe), almost every fourth of the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites is occupied in an ordered manner by Fe/Al or Al atoms, so that the unit cell consists of two twin-related domains alternately stacked along the orthorhombic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. The top and bottom quarters of the unit cell correspond to the orientation variant A, while the central half of the unit cell corresponds to the orientation variant B in 
 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(a</xref>). In other words, each of the twin domains is formed with the motif structure having the doubled unit cell dimension described in 
 <xref rid="S0003-S2002">Section 3.2</xref>, and they comprise the unit cell of the η″ phase with the twin boundaries corresponding to the diagonal glide planes at 
 <italic>z</italic> = 1/4 and 3/4. Importantly, it is the twin boundary that gives rise to the structural/compositional modulation that leads to the splitting of superlattice reflections. This is evident from the fact that while every fourth of the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain sites is ‘regularly’ occupied with the occupied-site sequence of …Al2/Al3/Al3/Al2/Al3/Al3… within the twin domains, this regularity is disturbed in the twin boundary region where the occupied-site sequence is …Al3/Al2/Al3/Al2/Al3…. The composition derived from the present structure refinement for the η″ phase is Al-29.2 at.%Fe, which is slightly lower in Fe content than the nominal alloy composition (Al-31.0 at.%Fe). Crystal structures of the η″ phase with different compositions can be constructed only by changing the number (M value) of the parent orthorhombic unit cells to be stacked along the orthorhombic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis (e.g. M = 15 for Al-30.0 at.%Fe), with identical atomic arrangements for the motif structure and the twin boundary.
