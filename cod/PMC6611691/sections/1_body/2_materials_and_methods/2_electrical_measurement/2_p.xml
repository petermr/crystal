<p>In a highly anisotropic crystal, accurate measurements of the electrical resistivity require careful consideration. For instance, to isolate the in-chain (diagonal) component of the electrical conductivity tensor, extreme care is needed to electrically short out the sample in the two directions perpendicular to the chain and, thus, ensure that current flow between the voltage contacts is uniaxial. In our experiments, this was achieved either by coating conductive paint or evaporating gold strips across the entire width of the sample in the two orthogonal current directions. The mounting configuration is shown in fig. S9. This configuration had been rigorously tested in a large number of LMO single crystals, which had led to consistent results for the absolute magnitudes of the resistivity along all three crystallographic axes, and their respective anisotropies showed excellent quantitative agreement with the measured anisotropy observed in both the optical conductivity (
