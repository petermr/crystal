<p id="Par25">As a more general remark, we note that with recent advances in neutron and synchrotron instrumentation, measurements of 3D diffuse-intensity distributions over a broad range of reciprocal space have been facilitated, creating opportunities for wider use of the approach described in this study. The accuracy and scope of structural information that can be recovered using combined-technique refinements are largely limited by the quality of experimental data and the sizes of atomic configurations that can be handled within reasonable computing times. The currently used atomic configurations are still at the lower limit of what is required for accurate treatment of nanoscale correlations in systems like PMN. In fact, since the PNRs grow at 200â€‰K, this configuration-size already becomes insufficient. Thus, harnessing the full power of nanoscale atomistic structural refinements requires improved instrumentation, more accurate data-reduction procedures, and efficient structure-refinement computer algorithms that would take full advantage of the underused computing resources available today.</p>
