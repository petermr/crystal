 </xref>. The calculated iso-energy band contours at 
 <italic>E</italic> = 0, −0.2, and −0.3 eV (below the calculated Fermi energy) are shown for the three possible (001) surface terminations. (The energies correspond to those of the surface states on the Sn-terminated surface.

 <italic>k</italic> on the P-terminated surfaces.
