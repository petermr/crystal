 </sup>, both of which have charge and orbital ordering transitions at higher temperatures than their magnetic transitions. However, the weak bonding interactions that shorten Fe–Fe distances in the trimerons do require ferromagnetic alignment of the three core

 </sup>. Hence, the rapid emergence of structural fluctuations in proportion to magnetisation on cooling below the long-range magnetic ordering temperature confirms that the direct Fe–Fe bonding interactions are the primary driver of the local distortions in magnetite. As suggested previously, the Fe–Fe interactions induce associated charge and orbital fluctuations that become ordered as trimeron units below the Verwey transition

 </sup>. The regular cubic spinel arrangement in which all nearest-neighbour Fe–Fe distances are equivalent is thus unstable with respect to local variations in Fe–Fe separations in the magnetically ordered state of magnetite. There are many degenerate arrangements for linking trimerons with similar connectivities to the observed low-temperature network shown in Fig.
