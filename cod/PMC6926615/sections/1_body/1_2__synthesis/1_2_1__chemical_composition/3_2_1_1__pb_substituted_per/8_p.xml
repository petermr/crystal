<p>Another good candidate for lead atom substitution in the perovskite materials is indium. In the work [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], a hydrothermal synthesis of zero-dimensional indium-based Cs
 <sub>2</sub>InBr
 <sub>5</sub>⋅H
 <sub>2</sub>O single crystal with emission in red spectral region with PLQY of 33% was reported. The strong PL emission is due to self-trapping excitons, which are the result of structural deformation in an excited state. The transition between hydrated Cs
 <sub>2</sub>InBr
 <sub>5</sub>⋅H
 <sub>2</sub>O and the dehydrated form is accompanied by a switchable double emission, which allows detecting water molecules motion in air or organic solvents (
