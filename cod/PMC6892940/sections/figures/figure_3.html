 <caption> X-ray absorbtion spectra (XAS): Ni L-edge XAS measured at room temperature for x = 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 compositions of LaSr 1− x Ca x NiReO 6 series are plotted together with the reference spectra of Ni XAS from LaNiO 3, PrNiO 3 and NiO samples. The reference spectra are plotted after digitizing and rescaling the data points from the Figs. 4 and 6 of the ref. 18 . Data have been vertically shifted for clarity. </caption>
