 <caption> Hirshfeld surface analysis [ 65] of the azoâ€“BTA star crystal studied by Lee et al. [ 17] and the fingerprint plots [ 66] ( d e- d i diagrams) of intermolecular interactions between oxygen ( a), nitrogen ( b), carbon ( c), hydrogen ( d) and other atoms in the molecular crystal. The percentage of the corresponding interaction is given in parentheses. The Hirshfeld surface is shown as a semitransparent surface with a reference molecule inside. The contacting atoms from the neighboring stars in the crystal are shown as beads. For the color scheme see Figure 1. </caption>
