<p>We sealed 2D perovskite microplates [(PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub>] with a ~40-μm in-plane size and a thickness of ~1 μm in symmetric DAC to perform in situ hydrostatic pressure study, as illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. We exfoliated the microplates from high-quality single crystal with highly oriented layer structure (see fig. S2). Ruby spheres with a diameter of ~12 μm were put in the chamber for pressure calibration (see fig. S1) (

 </xref>). By applying pressure, the fluorescence of the nanostructure gradually changes from green to red. A series of fluorescent microscopic images are taken from the investigated (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> crystal sheet inside the DAC (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) at the same lamp power. Within 3.5 GPa, the fluorescence can recover to its original color if the pressure is gradually released. However, after 3.5 GPa, the fluorescence quenches rapidly and loses the reversibility. The process of the fluorescence quenching is shown by the images labeled overloading. While the fluorescence of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> is weaker, the fluorescence of ruby sphere becomes more visible. These observations suggest that the structural change and fluorescence tunability of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> are reversible at a modest pressure within 3.5 GPa and irreversible at higher pressures.
