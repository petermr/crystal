  <p>C-type antiferromagnetic structure of PVO. Pb and V atoms are labeled on the illustration as green (big) and blue (medium) spheres, respectively. Oxygen atoms occur at the corners of the VO
   <sub>5</sub> square pyramid and are labeled as red (small) spheres. Two types of oxygen atoms are present in PbVO
   <sub>3</sub>, one at apical (labeled as O1) and the other at the planar (labeled as O2) position. The optimized atomic positions are Pb [0, 0, 0], V [0.5, 0.5, 0.5708 (0.5677)], O1 [0, 0, 0.2128 (0.2087)], and O2 [0, 0, 0.6902 (0.6919)]. The values in parentheses are from experimental measurements.
