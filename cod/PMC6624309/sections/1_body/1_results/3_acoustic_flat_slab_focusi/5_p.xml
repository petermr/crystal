<p id="Par17">We have demonstrated the effect of imaginary parameter α in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The bandgap range and center frequency between the second and third bands in the Γ-X direction increase with the increase in α. At the bandgap frequency range, it will forms a transmission valley, so the left and right EPs (
 <italic>T</italic> = 1) are easier to find around the bandgap. On both sides of the EPs, there will always be a case of 
 <italic>T</italic> &gt; 1, which determines the frequencies of the phase difference of π. Thus, the imaginary parameter α has a great effect on the frequencies of the phase transition. We can control the frequency, which has a phase difference of π, by changing the value of the imaginary part. Theoretically, a high focusing efficiency of reflected waves can also be acquired by modulating the gain/loss strength α. Therefore, both the frequency and the amplitude of acoustic flat focusing can be manipulated.
