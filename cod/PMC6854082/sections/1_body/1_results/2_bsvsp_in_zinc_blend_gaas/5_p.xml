<p id="Par13">We propose that one can tune spin polarization with strain. For example, an in-plane strain applied to GaAs would lower the crystallographic point group to 
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>2d</sub>. The little point group along symmetry line Γ → P (also along [111] direction) is 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> which is pseudo-polar. As a consequence, a net spin polarization is symmetry allowed, as indeed confirmed by our DFT calculations when applying an in-plane compressive strain to cubic GaAs (Supplementary Fig.
