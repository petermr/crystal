<p>The achievement of ternary transition metal nitrides is far from being trivial, as high temperatures and prolonged treatments are needed in order to obtain crystalline samples and nitrides are inherently less stable than oxides due to their lower free energies of formation.

 </sup> In the synthesis of alkaline or alkaline earth transition metal nitrides, these long thermal treatments may result in significant losses of the most electropositive metal, which trigger the control over the product composition. The list of the ternary Ca and Mg tantalum nitrides studied in this work and of the experimental conditions employed for their synthesis is given in
