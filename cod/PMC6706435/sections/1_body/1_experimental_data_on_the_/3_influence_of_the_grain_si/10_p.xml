 <italic>τ</italic> and the maximum value 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> leads to the increasing error. In order to obtain the maximum value of 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> for a given density, it is necessary to find the maximum value of several experiments for the same density, which can be treated as the result of the minimum distortion and the best homogeneity for a given density. The duration 
 <italic>τ</italic> corresponding to this value determines the chemical reaction time. It should be noted that in this interpretation, the minimum duration is an upper estimate of the real value which can be obtained by increasing the statistics.
