<p>In this section, we calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi compounds at the determined equilibrium lattice constants, via calculating the energy band structure, the densities of states, the electronic spin densities distribution and the magnetic moments. In order to check the atomic site preference in these two Heusler alloys and also investigate the reason for the contradictory behaviour observed for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, we include both L2
 <sub>1</sub> and XA structures. The electronic band structure and the corresponding density of state (DOS) for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in these two structures under their own equilibrium lattice are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F3">figure 3</xref>. It can be seen that the electronic bands exhibit an overlap with the Fermi energy level in both spin-up and spin-down directions for both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in either L2
 <sub>1</sub> or XA structures, which indicates their metallic nature. The effect of Hubbard U on the electronic band structure is also considered for the transition metal elements Fe and Ni, and results show that the metallic feature is still preserved even with some variation of the band structures. Usually, the DOS spectrum plays an important role for the structural stability of the intermetallic compounds [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In particular, a lower DOS at the Fermi energy level can induce a more stable structure. Thus, we compare the DOS of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi at the Fermi energy level in L2
 <sub>1</sub> and XA structures. It is found that the DOS values of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in XA structure at the Fermi energy level is 0.96 states/eV and 2.65 states/eV in spin-up and spin-down channels, which are lower than 1.19 states/eV and 3.10 states/eV in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure. For Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, the DOS values at Fermi energy are 1.02 states/eV and 2.31 states/eV in XA structure and 0.91 states/eV and 2.90 states/eV for L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure in spin-up and spin-down channels, respectively, indicating the total DOS in XA structure is smaller than that in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure. Consequently, we think the DOS values near the Fermi level have a dominant role of determining the stable XA structure in both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi.
