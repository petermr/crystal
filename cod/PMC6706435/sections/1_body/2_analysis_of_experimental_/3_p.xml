<p id="Par32">The function Φ
 <sub>1</sub>(
 <italic>ρ</italic>) is the approximation over all the points with the common grain size, Φ
 <sub>2</sub>(
 <italic>ρ</italic>) is the approximation for small grains, and Φ
 <sub>3</sub>(
 <italic>ρ</italic>) is the approximation over all the points regardless the grain size. For the larger number of events regardless the grain size, the significance level for the null hypothesis (the product 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>τ</italic> does not depend on the grain size) is the value close to zero (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, line 3). This probability increases sharply and tends to 100%, if the data are grouped according to the chosen principle of the influence of the grain size (functions Φ
 <sub>1</sub>(

 <sub>2</sub>(
 <italic>ρ</italic>)).
