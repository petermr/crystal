<p>The formation of novel polycrystalline phases obtained by employing a slow-evaporation technique was further confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The co-crystals show a characteristic spectral pattern which is similar to the ones of PROG and the CCFs. However, the frequencies of the C=O stretching vibration in the co-crystals appear blue-shifted due to the formation of the -C=O···H interaction between the PROG molecule and the CCFs. The IR spectrum of PROG-CNA shows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f005">Figure 5</xref>) that in fact the two carbonyl C=O vibrations appear at 1627.91 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1585.48 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, while in the PROG spectrum they are located at 1674.20 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and at 1612.49 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. It is also possible to compare the positions of the C=O vibrations of the PROG-DHB and PROG-DOD co-crystals: in the former the peaks appear at 1658.77 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1612.48 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> while in the latter at 1604 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The stretching frequencies of the C-H bonds of PROG in the co-crystals appear red-shifted when compared to the spectrum of the bare molecule. The peaks appear at 3371 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 3209 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 3440 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in PROG-CNA, PROG-DHB, and PROG-DOD respectively. All these frequencies are clearly higher than 2943 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, the frequency at which the C-H of the PROG molecule is located. This effect may be explained by the presence of a weak C-H···O or C-H···π interaction which induces the formation of more stable structures.
