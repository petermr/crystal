<p>MR images were acquired using a 7-T MR system (BioSpec 70/20 USR; Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) and a 3-T MR system (MAGNETOM Prisma; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The 7-T MR system was equipped with 
 <sup>1</sup>H quadrature transmit–receive volume coils with diameters of 35 and 72 mm (T9988 and T9562; Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) [
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The 3-D T1-weighted images were acquired using a fast low-angle shot pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time, 30 ms; echo time, 4.037–6.177 ms; flip angle, 40°; field of view, 22.5 × 15.0 × 15.0 to 42.0 × 28.0 × 28.0 μm
 <sup>3</sup>; matrix size, 636 × 424 × 424 to 768 × 512 × 512; and isotropic spatial resolution, 35.4–54.7 μm
