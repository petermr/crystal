<p>We investigated the hydrostatic pressure–induced changes of (PEA)

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> are obtained under the same conditions, showing the evolution with varying pressure. At the beginning, the spectral peak position of PL shifts to lower energy as pressure increases, maintaining a constant intensity level. The peak position can recover its original energy when the pressure is released before 3.5 GPa. After 3.5 GPa, the PL intensity drops markedly and cannot recover by decompression. The result is consistent with the fluorescent images, which together determine the reversible region (within 3.5 GPa) and irreversible region (beyond 3.5 GPa) in the compression process of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> under hydrostatic pressure. In the reversible region, the energy position of PL varies from green (2.38 eV) to red (2.06 eV), indicating large tunability across the visible spectrum. Although the PL intensity quenches in the irreversible region, the peak position keeps evolving toward lower energy until the PL fully disappears. The last several spectra beyond 4.5 GPa (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) show split peaks, which is likely due to the degeneracy of the excitonic levels lift by pressure. Previous low-temperature absorption and PL measurements have demonstrated multiple excitonic levels in organolead halide perovskites (
