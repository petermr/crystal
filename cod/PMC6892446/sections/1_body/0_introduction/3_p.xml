<p>We now present three new oxohydroxoferrates with the formula 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>[Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>] (
 <italic>A</italic>=K, Rb, Cs). Beside their hydroflux synthesis we report their crystal structures, their chemical and thermal decomposition as well as their magnetic properties. The three compounds are abbreviated as 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> for K
 <sub>2</sub>[Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>], 
 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic> for the corresponding rubidium and caesium compounds.
