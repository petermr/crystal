<p>The thermal properties of the hydroxoferrates were characterized by TG and DTA with a Netzsch STA 449 C in an argon‐filled glovebox from 25 to 1000 °C with the heating rate of 5 K min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The phase transition of K
 <sub>2</sub>[Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>] was analyzed by DSC with a PerkinElmer DSC 8500 in an argon‐filled glovebox from −30 to 140 °C with a heating and cooling rate of ±5 K min
 <sup>−1</sup>.
