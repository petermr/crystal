 <caption> a) Process flow to fabricate QREFs by photoalignment technology. b) 250 × 250 µm 2 fluorescence micrographs of green (b) and red (c) emitting QREFs. The corresponding curves for the emitted intensity as a function of the polarizer axis rotation angle, are presented in section (d) for green emitting QR and (e) for red emitting QR. Frame (f) represents the mixed QREF and (g) the multiple layer QREF. Reproduced with permission. 39 Copyright 2017, Wiley‐VCH. </caption>
