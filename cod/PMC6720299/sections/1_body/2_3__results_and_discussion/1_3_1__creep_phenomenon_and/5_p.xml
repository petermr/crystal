<p>On the one hand, under higher temperatures and stress levels, nanocrystalline NiAl can have several types of defects such as vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries, leading to an obvious creep process. As temperature increases, the frequencies and amplitudes of atomic vibrations become higher. The increased temperature allows for the atoms to pass over the energy barrier. Hence, the diffusion and dislocation activity may be accelerated during creep process. As stress increases, the equilibrium concentration of vacancies is altered in nanocrystalline NiAl. If grain boundaries and dislocations are applied as tensile stress, the equilibrium concentration of vacancies may be increased [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, if a vacancy concentration gradient occurs in a crystal, the vacancies can diffuse along rapid diffusion paths, such as grain boundaries or dislocations. At the same time, the diffusion rate may be increased because atoms are more likely to overcome the energy barrier under high stress levels. Additionally, higher stress levels enhance the nucleation of dislocations and their glide velocity.
