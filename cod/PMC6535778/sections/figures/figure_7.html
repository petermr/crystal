 <caption> Comparison of the calculated bulk and surface band structures for EuSn 2P 2. (Aâ€“F) Bulk (left) and surface (right) band spectra of a semi-infinite slab with an (001) surface terminated at Sn (upper), P (middle), or Eu (lower) layers. The surface states are the narrow extra states observed in the surface state calculations (right). </caption>
