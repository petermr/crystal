 <caption> Ground-state diagram at 0 K for α-SiB 3– x , where x = 0.5, 0.18, 0, −0.2, and −0.67 in relation to thermodynamically stable β-SiB 3. The red crosses are the DFT calculated formation energies of the 1019 configurations (up to a supercell size of 42 atoms), which were included in the cluster expansion. </caption>
