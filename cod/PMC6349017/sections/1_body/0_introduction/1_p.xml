<p>Proton 
 <italic>transfer</italic> (PT) is the process in which a proton (H
 <sup>+</sup>) is transferred from one molecule to another. PT reactions play an important role for acid/base chemistry, heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, corrosion, biochemistry, and applications like proton exchange membrane fuel cells, where the protons act as charge carriers.
