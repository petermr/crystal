    "The luminescence properties of Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+ and Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ phosphors are presented. After being excited by a light source, Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ phosphors emit intense yellow long persistent luminescence covering the region from 450 to 700 nm, which can last about 8 h. Thermoluminescence curves were demonstrated to analyze the trapping nature of persistent luminescence. Tm3+ is added to improve the long persistent luminescence properties of phosphors. The mechanism of persistent luminescence has been studied."
