 <title>Lighting: Shining in the cyan valley</title>
 <p id="Par2">Luminescent crystals that efficiently emit light in the narrow cyan color wavelength range, from 470 to 500 nanometers, could be used to fill a gap or “valley” in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) intended to mimic the full spectrum of daylight. There is great interest in developing more efficient and cost-effective full daylight spectrum LED lighting sources. These can create more natural indoor lighting conditions that are also believed to be more beneficial for health. Researchers in China and Russia, led by Zhiguo Xia at the University of Science and Technology Beijing, developed a suitable inorganic crystalline compound showing narrow cyan emission, with the formula Na
  <sub>0.5</sub>K
  <sub>0.5</sub>Li
  <sub>3</sub>SiO
  <sub>4</sub>:Eu
  <sup>2+</sup>. The many possible applications include LEDs for daylight spectrum lamps used to treat the low mood and depression associated with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).
