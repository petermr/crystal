<p>Not enough IR or Raman data are available for group 2 (apart from Mg and Ca) and the rest of alanates of the periodic table. Additionally to the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02724-f031">Figure 31</xref>, an attempt to find trends that include the double-metal alanates of groups 1 and 2 was performed; no clear trends were found. This can open the possibility of theoretical and experimental studies to obtain these missing data and to obtain general rules that correlate structure and spectroscopic properties.
