<p>Manganese oxides with birnessite-type structures (K-birnessite) were synthesized by the thermal reduction of a manganese salt, KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> (Merck, Darmstand-Germany, 99%), as detailed in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The procedure was as follows; the KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> in powder form was homogeneously dispersed in a porcelain dish and exposed to calcination in a muffle furnace at temperatures of 400 and 800 째C for 6 h at 10 째C/min, to induce the thermal reduction, then they were cooled to room temperature. After calcination, each material was washed with deionized and distilled water to remove any soluble salts (potassium manganates) formed during the process and to reduce the pH from 12 to 9.5. The materials were dried at 60 째C for 24 h for further characterization. The materials were named as Mn4 and Mn8 (from thermal reduction at 400 and 800 째C, respectively).
