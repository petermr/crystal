 </xref> shows the crystal structure of an orthorhombic PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub>. The structure of PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub> is modeled by doubling the mother material PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> with an oxygen vacancy. Along the (001) crystal direction in the oxide, the Pr–O and the Ba–O atomic layers are alternately ordered, and the Co–O atomic layers are positioned between the Pr–O and the Ba–O layers. There are two types of cobalt ions, Co
 <sub>Oct</sub> and Co
 <sub>Py</sub>, in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub> due to the presence of oxygen vacancy, while only Co
 <sub>Oct</sub> exists in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>.
