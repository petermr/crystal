<p>Lattice parameters of all geometrically optimized supercells were extracted. The parameter 
 <italic>a</italic> was divided by 
 <italic>L</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> was divided by 2 for comparison. The resulting parameters of all compositions and the different Al/Si ordering patterns are shown in Fig. 10
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"> ▸</xref>. Experimental parameters were included as described in the figure caption. Experimental lattice parameters were measured at ambient conditions, whereas the calculations correspond to a temperature of 0 K and a pressure of 0 Pa. No measurements of thermal expansion coefficients or lattice parameters close to these conditions are available, but the extrapolation of measurements at elevated temperatures (Schneider &amp; Eberhard, 1990
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb70"> ▸</xref>) allows one to estimate that a temperature correction would decrease the experimental 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> by less than 0.01 Å and 
 <italic>b</italic> by less than 0.02 Å. This has no relevant influence on the present analysis.
