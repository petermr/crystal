 <caption> PXRD patterns (Cu Kα 1 radiation) of products from Si/B 1:4 reaction mixtures after dwelling at 1175 °C for various times (cf. Figure 3 b). The position of diffraction lines for α-SiB 3– x and β-SiB 3 is indicated by the black and red markers, respectively. The 2θ range containing pronounced reflections from SiB 36 (β-boron structure) is marked in gray. </caption>
