 <p>Using field-theoretic simulations based on a self-consistent field theory (SCFT) with or without finite compressibility, nanoscale mesophase formation in molten linear AB and ABC block copolymers is investigated in search of candidates for new and useful nanomaterials. At selected compositions and segregation strengths, the copolymers are shown to evolve into some new nanostructures with either unusual crystal symmetry or a peculiar morphology. There exists a holey layered morphology with Im3 symmetry, which lacks one mirror reflection compared with Im3m symmetry. Also, a peculiar cubic bicontinuous morphology, whose channels are connected with tetrapod units, is found to have Pn3m symmetry. It is shown that there is another network morphology with tripod connections, which reveals P432 symmetry. The optimized free energies of these new mesophases and their relative stability are discussed in comparison with those of double gyroids and double diamonds.</p>
