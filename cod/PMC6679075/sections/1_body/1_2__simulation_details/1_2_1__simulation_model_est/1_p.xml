<p>In this study, Materials Studio 7.0 simulation software was used to simulate the distribution characteristics of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and water molecules in Ca-montmorillonite with different charge density [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Material Studio is a material simulation computing platform developed by Accelrys, USA. Firstly, according to the semi-crystal structure formula M
 <sub>x+y</sub>(Al
 <sub>2–x</sub>Mg
 <sub>x</sub>)(Si
 <sub>4–y</sub>Al
 <sub>y</sub>)O
 <sub>10</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>nH
 <sub>2</sub>O, the corresponding montmorillonite crystal model was established [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Where M is the interlayer exchangeable cation (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>) and x + y is the unit layer charge. The structure belongs to the monoclinic C2/m space group, the crystal layer constant a = 0.523 nm, b = 0.906 nm, and the c value is variable, when the structural unit layer is anhydrous, c = 0.960 nm [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; if water molecules are present among the structural unit layers, the value of c will vary with the number of water molecules and the exchangeable cations in the interlayers. 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02318-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the atomic coordinates of montmorillonite. Secondly, based on these previously mentioned parameters, the montmorillonite model can be established. The montmorillonite super-cell consisted of 32 formula units in the form of 8 × 4 × 1 in the X-,Y- and Z-axis directions, respectively. Thirdly, according to our studying purpose, we designed different isomorphic substitution conditions in the super-cell. The principle of substitution is: the substitution position is random and two adjacent positions can’t be replaced at the same time.
