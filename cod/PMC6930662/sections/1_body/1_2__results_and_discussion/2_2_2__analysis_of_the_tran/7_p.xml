<p>There are two important conclusions from the Hirshfeld surface analysis. First of all, the visual inspection of these charts shows the molecular asymmetry in terms of interactions with the surrounding molecules in the crystal. Secondly, the strongest interactions are realized along the stack due to the hydrogen bonds and C–H
