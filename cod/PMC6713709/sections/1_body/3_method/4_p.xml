<p id="Par18">For photoelectron microspectroscopy measurements on the 3DnanoESCA station at BL07LSU in SPring-8, an incident X-ray (1000 eV) was focused by a Fresnel zone plate and an order-sorting pinhole aperture of 80 μm was used. Photoelectrons were detected by a modified angle-resolved photoelectron spectrometer (VG Scienta R3000-EWAL) with a pass energy of 200 eV. In the measurement of the initial condition, the terminal of a working electrode (LCO electrode) was grounded. After the measurement of the initial condition, terminal C (counter electrode of Li metal) and terminal D (working electrode) were connected to a potentiostat-galvanostat (solartron 1287) for the electrochemical measurements. A mapping image of the scanning photoelectron microscopy was obtained by the O 1 
 <italic>s</italic> core level spectra. Selected specific micro-area photoelectron spectra were measured at the initial condition, and after charge and discharge based on this O 1
 <italic>s</italic> mapping image. Finally, the mapping images of the energy region of Li 1
 <italic>s</italic> and Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> core levels were obtained in the same LCO particle.
