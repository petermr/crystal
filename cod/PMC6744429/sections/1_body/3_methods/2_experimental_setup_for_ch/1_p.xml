<p id="Par20">The fundamental (pump) beam is produced by a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser (Chameleon, Coherent) with a 75 fs pulse duration, 80 MHz pulse repetition rate, and a tunable wavelength ranging from 690 to 1050 nm. Its power is controlled by a half-wave plate and a polarizing beam splitter. The input fundamental beam is injected into the crystal with polarization along the 
 <italic>z</italic>-axis so that the largest nonlinear coefficient 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>33</sub> in the 3D LiNbO
 <sub>3</sub> NPCs is used. The polarization direction is controlled by another half-wave plate. The input beam is focused by a 75 mm lens and incident into the sample. The diameter of the beam waist at the focal point is about 40 μm. Diffraction pattern of the fundamental wave indicates a small change in refractive index (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for details). Output far-field SH patterns are projected onto a white screen and then recorded by a camera. A power meter is used to measure the SH power from different diffraction orders under different input wavelengths.
