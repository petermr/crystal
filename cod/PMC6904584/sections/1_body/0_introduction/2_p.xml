<p id="Par4">In this study, we report significantly enhanced PLQE of sky-blue-emission polycrystalline perovskite films from 1.1% to 49.7% by incorporating PEACl and YCl
 <sub>3</sub> into three-dimensional (3D) CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite films, where PEACl is phenylethylammonium chloride (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>Cl) and YCl
 <sub>3</sub> is Yttrium (III) chloride. The sky-blue PeLEDs with 2% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> showed high EQE of 11.0% and maximum brightness of 9040 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup>. Blue PeLED with 4.8% EQE was obtained by adding 10% YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the perovskite film, with a device Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.10, 0.13).
