<p>Because of the lack of experimental shock sensitivity for most of the EMs studied, we proposed using 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> as a theoretical indicator to characterize the ease of the shock reaction initiation. Because shock sensitivity has been proven to have a satisfactory correlation with the impact sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], we used the experimental value

 <sub>50%</sub> as a reference to compare with 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic>, as shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. We note comparing 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>50%</sub> values from the same experiments can well reflect the relative sensitivity of different compounds, while comparing those from different experiments was only qualitatively reasonable because of the influence of different experimental conditions used.
