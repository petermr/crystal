 <p>S.J. and P.A. contributed equally. S.J. designed the project and the method of synthesis. S.J. and P.A. have synthesized and characterized the compounds. S.J. and P.A. have performed the XAS and 
  <italic>R</italic> vs 
  <italic>T</italic> measurements and analysis. The magnetic measurements and analysis are performed by S.J., P.A., P.A.K. and P.S., while O.K.F., E.N., V.P., M.M. and Y.S. have performed the NPD measurements. O.K. has helped in performing x-ray absorption spectroscopy and contributed in discussion. V.S. has done the NPD analysis and the combined NPD and XRD refinement. S.J., P.A. and S.R. wrote the main body of the manuscript, while all the authors contributed in writing and reviewing the manuscript.
