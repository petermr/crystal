<p>To further understand the role of the J3/1 insertion element in ligand recognition, we examined it in the context of both 
 <italic>env1</italic>(2′-dG-II) and 
 <italic>xpt</italic>. Strikingly, deletion of these two nucleotides in 
 <italic>env1</italic> only results in a moderate loss of affinity for 2′-dG (7.1-fold, Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), while a U75A mutant reduces affinity 46-fold. A simple explanation for this observation is that a more sterically bulky purine at position 75 that still engages with A24 would push the backbone of J3/1 outwards, potentially disrupting a number of neighboring interactions as opposed to the deletion mutant that only ablates the A24–U75 pair. The deletion mutant is more modest than the C51U mutation that results in an 18-fold loss of 2′-dG binding affinity. These data indicate that the two nucleotide insertion element in J3/1 is not essential for promoting 2′-dG binding in this class of riboswitches, although the A24-U75 interaction increases affinity. Insertion of these two nucleotides into the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch aptamer at the equivalent position does not promote 2′-dG binding, as affinity does not change compared to wild type 
 <italic>xpt</italic> (8.1 ± 0.6 μM and 7.7 ± 0.4 μM, respectively). However, its affinity for hypoxanthine (HX)—one of its cognate ligands—is weakened from 0.73 ± 0.1 μM (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) to 21 ± 2 μM, a 29-fold reduction in affinity. Thus, the J3/1 insertion in the context of the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch changed selectivity from favoring HX by ∼10-fold to favoring 2′-dG by 2.6-fold. Further alteration of 
 <italic>xpt</italic> by including the U51C mutation that was previously shown to promote 2′-dG binding (
 <italic>xpt</italic>(U51C), 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>D,app</sub> = 12 ± 1 μM, (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)) increased the affinity 4.2-fold to 1.6 ± 0.1 μM while nearly abolishing affinity for hypoxanthine (&gt;100 μM). Thus, the identity of position 51 in concert with the two nucleotide insertion in J1/3 promotes both tighter and more selective 2′-dG binding in the context of the 
 <italic>xpt</italic> aptamer. These data suggest that these nucleotides are the strongest drivers of nucleoside versus nucleobase binding selectivity in purine riboswitches, but other changes to the sequence in the junction are required to achieve the highest affinity for 2′-dG.
