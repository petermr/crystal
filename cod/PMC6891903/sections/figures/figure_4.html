 <caption> Experimental measurement results of the wind‐driven TIEL. Dependence of wavelength spectra on a) the materials of the electrification layer, b) thickness of the luminescent layer, c) wind blowing time, and d) length–width ratio of the material at a wind speed of 10 m s −1. e) Wind‐driven TIEL photographs vertically taken from the bottom of the device under the tunable wind speed from 5 to 14 m s −1. f) Corresponding TIEL intensity under the tunable wind speed from 5 to 14m s −1. g) ML and h) TIEL intensity at different wind speeds from 1 to 21 m s −1. i) Corresponding intensity of ML and TIEL in distinct regions. </caption>
