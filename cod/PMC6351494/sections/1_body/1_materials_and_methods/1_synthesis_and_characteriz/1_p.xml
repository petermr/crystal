<p>The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> powders were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction from stoichiometric amount of magnesium powder (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) and bismuth powder (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) or antimony powder (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) with 10% excess magnesium. The metal powders were thoroughly mixed using an agate mortar and pestle. Subsequently the mixture of the materials were mechanically milled using a planetary ball mill (PL-7, Fritsch) with ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> grinding bowls and balls, for 8 h at 400 rpm. The milled powders were pressed into pellets and calcined at 550Â°C for 5 h to obtain the single phase of the intermetallics. The calcined pellets were ground and sieved before the preparation of the electrode slurry. In order to avoid the oxidation of the materials, all the synthesis procedures were carried out under inert atmosphere.
