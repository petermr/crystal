<p>Subsequently, we built large-scale supercells of the eleven EM crystals for the shock simulations. As shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the supercells generally contained more than 1000 atoms, with the lattice length in the range of 15~30 Ã…. There were 24~64 molecules in each supercell, containing 72~192 trigger chemical bonds. The number of the chemical bonds included here was an order of magnitude larger than the traditional 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD simulations, and thereby better reflects the randomness and probability characteristics of the chemical reaction kinetics.
