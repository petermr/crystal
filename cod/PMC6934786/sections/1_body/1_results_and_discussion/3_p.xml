<p id="Par5">It can be emphasized here that this should be the highest mobility that can be achieved in hopping regime in a-b plane whereas along c-axis maximum mobility has been found to be 4.45 × 10

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> in Supplementary Information). Mobilities in these devices have been estimated using space charge limited conduction (SCLC) method

This can be attributed to the minimal effect of disorder on transport along c-axis compared to that in a-b plane as evident from the excellent matching of experimental and theoretical values of mobility along c-axis compared to difference (0.3 vs 1.8 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/Vs) in a-b plane.
