<p id="Par14">The SXRD analysis also finds considerable relaxations within the TL’s. The first TL adjacent to the substrate is notably stretched as compared to its bulk counterpart, namely, the interplanar distance between the terminating iodine atoms (in other words, the height of a TL) increases from 3.61 Å (bulk) to 3.89 Å. The interatomic Bi–I distances towards the substrate (3.32–3.44 Å) are considerably longer than in the opposite direction (2.94–3.00 Å). All bismuth atoms (light and dark grey #2, 3 atoms in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) are strongly displaced from the central position within the coordination octahedra towards the same side, namely, away from the substrate. The driving force of this movement cannot be pinpointed in a straightforward way, since the difference in electronegativity between iodine (2.66) and selenium (2.55) is not large, and both values are much higher than that for bismuth (2.02). One may tentatively assume that the I/Se interaction at the film/substrate interface -although weak- might lead to a weakening of the I–Bi bond and with it to an elongation of the corresponding bonds. Consideration of the van der Waals (Bi: 1.82 Å vs. I: 2.01 Å) and the (effective) ionic (Bi

 </sup> imposes limits of 3.86 Å and 2.73 Å for the Bi–I interatomic distance for atomic and ionic bonds, respectively. The distances derived from the SXRD analysis suggest a considerable ionicity of the Bi–I bond.
