<p id="Par12">The most intense bands appear between 900 and 1100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The band at 905 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to the Si-O stretching of the tetrahedral units

 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to the symmetric C-O stretching from the [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] units. The triplet structure is a consequence of the different environment surrounding the two distinct non-equivalent [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] units of tilleyite. In the lower frequency region, at 649 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, the bending of the Si-O-Si inter-tetrahedral linkage appears
