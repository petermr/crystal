<p>From the view of the adhesion component and ploughing component, the contact area and the scratching depth are changed with the variation of the texture orientation. For the case of 0° orientation, the tip slides perpendicular to the texture, and the discontinuous shorter contacts induce a smaller contact area at the initial stage. Due to the scratching of the tip, the atoms are rearranged and accumulated, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f012">Figure 12</xref>, which leads to a larger contact area and a higher scratching depth, so the corresponding adhesion component and ploughing component are enhanced greatly. When the texture orientation is 90°, the tip slides parallel to the texture, and the continuous adhesion in the contact junction induces a high adhesion component and a high average friction force. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f012">Figure 12</xref>, the atom accumulation of the case of 45° texture orientation indicates that the scratching depth is lower, and the contact area is smaller, which produces a lower ploughing component and a lower adhesion component, so the average friction force is the lowest.
