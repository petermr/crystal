<p>The prevention or reduction of cell damage caused by free radicals is of great current and rising concern. With the intention of solving this problem, a wide variety of synthetic antioxidants and radical scavengers have been developed in pharmaceutical and nutritional fields [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Homeostasis against the action of free radicals and active oxygen species is maintained in cells by a specialized antioxidant network, where superoxide dismutase converts O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>●−</sup> to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> or molecular oxygen. The successive conversion of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to water and oxygen is catalyzed by catalase and peroxidase enzymes [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A common feature among these metalloenzymes is the presence of transition metal ions such as Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ion as active centers [
