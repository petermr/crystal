 <caption> Fabrication and characterization of Au@Ag SHINs as optical amplifiers. ( A) A simulation of the maximum size-dependent enhancement at the hotspot between two shell-isolated Ag nanoparticles (Ag SHIN) as calculated by 3D-FDTD simulations (inset). ( B) Schematic of the synthesis of Au@Ag SHINs. ( C) Maximum enhancement factors calculated by 3D-FDTD simulation for 100-nm-diameter Au@AgSHINs with different Au core sizes. ( D) HAADF-STEM image with corresponding EDS mapping images of Au@Ag SHINs. ( E) A series of SHINER spectra of DPA-TPM-G4 acquired with Au@Ag SHINs having 70-, 100-, and 115-nm particle sizes, compared with a normal Raman spectrum acquired without SHINs as a reference. Inset: Raman enhancement ratios calculated by comparing the signal intensities in SHINER spectra and a standard normal Raman spectrum acquired without SHINs. </caption>
