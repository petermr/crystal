<p>These differences allow us to account for several apparent discrepancies between the experimental and computational results. First, the DFT underestimates the unit-cell volume and hence overestimates the bulk modulus. This is a natural consequence of neglecting thermal expansion. Second, the DFT predicts that the orthorhombic phase is mechanically stiffer than the rhombohedral one (

 <italic>c</italic>,
 <italic>d</italic>). Again, this can be explained in terms of the points above. Considering only distortions at the gamma point and zero temperature, the modelling shows that compression of the rhombohedral phase is easier than for the orthorhombic structure, presumably because of the rhombohedral phase's flexibility along the hexagonal 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis, discussed previously. On the other hand, the experimental results will reflect the influence of thermally excited vibrational modes, including those at other wavevectors. Importantly, the DFT isolates the specific sense of flexibility that we argue is responsible for the phase transformation behaviour: the ability of the rhombohedral metal formate framework to accommodate the guanidinium ions at a variety of unit-cell volumes. Thus the difference between experimental and simulated bulk moduli does not contradict our argument above.
