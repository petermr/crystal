 <caption> Energy-resolution measurements and valence-band mapping at hν = 5.977 keV for the prototypical example W(110) at 30 K. ( a) Fermi-edge cutoff spectra for the monochromator crystals Si(333) and Si(311). ( b) Survey overview ( k x – k y section) and summed detail patterns of the regions around the high-symmetry points N ( b′) and Γ ( b′′). ( c)–( f) E B-versus- k sections through high-symmetry points reveal a strongly improved signal-to-noise ratio in the sections through five summed N- ( d) and Γ-point regions ( f) in comparison to sections through a single N- ( c) and Γ-point ( e). ( g)–( l) k x – k y sections taken in the rectangular area marked in ( b) at binding energies 1–7 as denoted in ( c). The k-scales are quantified by the scale bars in ( b), ( f) and ( k). </caption>
