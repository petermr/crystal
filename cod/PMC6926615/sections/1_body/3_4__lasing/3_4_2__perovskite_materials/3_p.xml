<p>By altering the shape of micro-sized perovskite materials, an emission enhancement by WGM can be achieved. Thus, WG modes are observed in microspheres, microcubes, microdisks, etc. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f007">Figure 7</xref>aâ€“f). In work [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], it was shown that by varying the length of the perovskite cuboid edge, a single- to multi-mode upconversion lasing is obtained at room temperature, which is also confirmed by numerical calculations of standing wave field distribution inside the perovskite cavity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). Thus, wavelength of lasing can be tuned from 534 to 544 nm via the size of the cavity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,c,d). In work [
 <xref rid="B108-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], it was shown that the single mode lasing in the centimeter-sized arrays of perovskite microdisks can be achieved by the pattering the thin film via laser ablation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f005">Figure 5</xref>e). Since the morphology of microdisks can be easily changed, it makes it possible to controllably tune the operating wavelength in the range from 550 to 800 nm (
