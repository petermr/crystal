<p>The luminescent properties of the wind‐driven TIEL (Movie S2, Supporting Information) are studied in

 </xref>. The compressed air is used to generate the wind with an adjustable speed by a pressure regulator in order to simulate natural wind. First, material chosen of the electrification layer is a primary factor, which is fabricated by different polymer films, including fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET), Nylon, and TPU. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, the TPU sample has the highest luminescence intensity, followed by the Nylon‐based sample, which can be attributed to different electric polarities of these materials.
 <xref rid="advs1381-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> The triboelectric polarity of FEP is similar to that of the PDMS‐based material, resulting in the weakest luminescence. The Scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM) has been employed to characterize the surface charge density of the luminescence layer after rubbing with these materials (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The instantaneously increment of the surface charge density is in good agreement with the experimental results (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Thus, in this case, the TPU is selected as the electrification layer because of its positive electricity and excellent mechanical stability. The TIEL mechanism is further proposed by the dependence of above materials on the luminescence intensity, and other mechanism is excluded, such as ML. Second, the impact on the film thickness is discussed in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. It is found that if the phosphor layer is excessively thick, the light emission would be blocked, resulting in the decrease of light intensity. The strongest luminescence intensity is obtained with an optimal thickness of 600 µm. Third, durability test was also conducted in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c. After exposure for 5 h, the intensity of the TIEL basically remains the same, which shows the excellent stability and repeatability of TIEL. Fourthly, the length–width ratio of the material in the slicing process (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) is also an important factor to determine the TIEL intensity. On the one hand, if the length–width ratio of the material is too small, the contact areas of strips between the layers are small. On the other hand, a larger length–width ratio would make the system in a complex vibration state and induce the adhesion of the system, thus resulting in a lower TIEL intensity. In this case, the width of the phosphor layer is 3 mm, and the optimal length of the material is 5 cm, which leads to the strongest TIEL intensity (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Furthermore, the photographs of the wind‐driven TIEL under different wind speed (5–14 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>) are displayed in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, which are taken along the direction vertical to cylinder bottom and the luminescence intensity mapping is obtained after image processing by MatLab (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The corresponding TIEL spectra show that the luminescence intensity increases with wind speed increasing, whereas the positions of the emission peaks are almost unchanged (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). In addition, materials without the electrification layers (TPU) are prepared under the same condition to study the effect of ML. By comparison, it is found that the lowest excitation wind speed of ML is 15 m s
 <sup>−1</sup> (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g), which is much higher than that of the TIEL (1 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h). This indicates that the ML could be only obtained under a moderate wind, but the TIEL could be successfully obtained under a light wind. Specific values of TIEL and ML under different wind speed are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i, and a three‐section behavior of the luminescence intensity can be observed (top curve). According to previous reports,
 <xref rid="advs1381-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> the amplitude and the frequency of the electric potential variation play key roles in the TIEL intensity. In section I, under a low wind speed, the effect of contact electrification plays a decisive role, leading to the enlargement of the electric potential amplitude and the increment of TIEL intensity. In section II, TIEL intensity increasing slows down due to the saturation of the tribocharge density. In this part, the amplitude no longer increases with the increase of wind speed, TIEL intensity is only related to the frequency. In section III, TIEL intensity further increases, which is attributed to the superposition of TIEL and ML. The ML of the phosphors appears as the wind speed exceeds 15 m s
 <sup>−1</sup> (bottom curve), which is consistent with previous reports on the threshold stress of ZnS‐based materials.
 <xref rid="advs1381-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Nevertheless, although TIEL can be emitted at a speed of 1 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>, only efficient TIEL excited with a speed more than 5 m s
 <sup>−1</sup> can be effectively converted into electrical signals by the perovskite‐based PD. The research orientation is to further improve the TIEL intensity and obtain the stronger luminescence at a lower wind speed.
