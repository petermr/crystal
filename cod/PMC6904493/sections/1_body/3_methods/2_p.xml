<p id="Par16">First, we focus on the density-functional theory and the electronic structure that is employed for calculating forces on displaced atoms. The electronic structure is constructed from a full-potential linear muffin-tin orbitals method

No parameters are adjustable; the (Racah) parameters associated with the orbital polarization are calculated self-consistently from Slater integrals of wave functions as described before
