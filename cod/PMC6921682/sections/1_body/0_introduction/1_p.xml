<p>A reversible photoluminescence intensity on–off by external stimuli and/or by a chemical reaction is attractive with respect to development of sensing. It is a promising approach to apply a weak interaction to construct the switch using a reversible chemical reaction. Metal complexes have an advantage to be capable to use a weak coordination bond as well as a hydrogen bond and an intermolecular interaction for this purpose. We suppose that the control of the on–off reaction using the weak interaction/bond in a solid state is sometimes easier than that in a solution because thermal motion of the molecule is restricted in the solid state. In practice, the reversible luminescence color and/or intensity switching of metal complexes via mechanochemical reactions have been studied extensively for d
 <sup>10</sup> and d
 <sup>8</sup> complexes.

 </sup> The driving force of luminescence intensity change in these complexes was by change in intermolecular interactions such as the π–π interaction. In contrast, the solid-based reversible reactions involving drastic luminescence intensity change by change in the coordination number and composition of the complex are still rare.
