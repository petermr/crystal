<p id="Par13">The observed off-center displacements of Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> and Nb
 <sup>5+</sup> agree with the known tendencies of these cations to form short, strongly covalent bonds with oxygen via hybridization of their respective 6s and 4d states with O 2p states. The magnitudes of the local Pb displacements increase with the Mg/Nb ratio in the [PbNb

  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>Mg
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>] clusters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), with a similar dependence obtained for both 300 K and 200 K. This trend can be attributed to the lower ionic charge of Mg and hence its less covalent bond with oxygen, which results in increasingly underbonded-oxygen atoms as 
 <italic>n</italic> increases; therefore, larger Pb shifts are required to satisfy the oxygen-bonding requirements. Concurrently, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> has a larger ionic radius (≈0.70 Å) than Nb
 <sup>5+</sup> (≈0.64 Å)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> resulting in the larger size of the cuboctahedral cages for the Mg-rich configurations; this ionic-radii difference is comparable to the difference in the values of Pb displacements for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 0 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).
