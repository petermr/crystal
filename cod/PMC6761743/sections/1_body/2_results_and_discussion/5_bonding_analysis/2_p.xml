<p>An examination of the −pCOHP curves for all sulfides reveals that the transition-metal–sulfide interactions near the Fermi levels stem essentially from contributions of the M-d and S-p atomic orbitals. The heteroatomic M–S interactions change from bonding to antibonding states below the Fermi levels in all sulfides and, hence, are of an antibonding nature at the Fermi levels. The antibonding M–S interactions are “counterbalanced” by bonding M–M interactions. The latter homoatomic interactions arise mainly from the M-d bands located around the Fermi levels. An integration of the heteroatomic M–S and homoatomic M–M interactions indicates net bonding characters for these interactions (see

 </xref>). Yet, how can these interactions affect the presence of vacancies and, furthermore, the chemical compositions of these sulfides?
