<p>Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was also used to test for any changes in bulk chemistry of the precipitates related to the incorporation of significant concentrations of additional ions from solution. DRIFTS analysis was carried out using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer. For the analysis, subsamples of precipitates from each experiment were mixed with IR transparent KBr powder. Each spectrum was acquired using 64 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. Surface complexation of solution species onto the surface of Li-carbonate was tested in situ using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The ATR-IR measurements were performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet iS5 apparatus with iD7 diamond crystal ATR accessory. ATR-IR experiments were performed on solid Li-carbonate grown in solutions with only LiBr and NaCO
 <sub>3</sub> exposed to 1 M NaCl, 1 M KCl, 0.33 M MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 0.25 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solutions. In addition, Li-carbonate precipitated in the presence of K

 <sup>2–</sup> was also tested in 1 M KCl, 1 M NaCl, and 0.33 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solutions respectively to examine the effect of changes in specific surfaces on the adsorption spectra.
