<p>Using Mesodyn and also Matlab for comparison purposes, we tried to visualize the 3-dimensional morphology of the copolymer melt. While the well-known double diamond structure with Pn3m symmetry is expected to appear, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01081-f007">Figure 7</xref> portrays a totally new image of the morphology for the copolymer. Inside the cube, two triangular A-domains are connected with one of them rotated by 180 degrees to form a bicontinuous morphology. The B-domains then run through the triangular A-domains via three channels. The overall shape of the new morphology is considered to resemble the sacred Metatronâ€™s cube [
 <xref rid="B42-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It is noted that the channels are connected with tetrapod units.
