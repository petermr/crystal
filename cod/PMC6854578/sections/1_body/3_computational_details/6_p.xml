<p>Regarding the ionic hydration structure, the water in the first hydration shell (FHS) has the most important influence on the structure and properties of the system;
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>
 </sup> thus, our studies will only focus on FHS. The schematic illustration of FHS of an ion is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>. The cutoff radius (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>) for FHS is defined as first minimum of radial distribution functions (RDFs) between ions and oxygens. We have found that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> for Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup> is 3.25 and 3.75 Å, respectively. To further characterize the local environment of an ion, two coordination numbers (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>) are defined, where 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>w</sub> denotes the number of water molecules in FHS, the so-called hydration number, and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> is the number of the nearest counter ions. When calculating 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>, the ions in the crystal are not taken into account.
