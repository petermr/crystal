 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">Experimental Section</xref> for details). The as-prepared sample consists of homogenous micrometric aggregates of sub-micrometric and nanometric particles (see

 </xref>B). The Mg/Ta ratio determined from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was 0.45 with distribution of both elements being homogeneous (see

 <sup>3–</sup> layers between which both Mg

Such anisotropic broadening might be due to the presence of stacking faults, in line with observations in other layered compounds reported in the literature.
