<p id="p0140">The experimental researches of heavy metals sorption by zeolite of the Yagodnisky deposit of the Kamchatka region from model solutions in the concentrations range from 0.5 up to 3.5 mg-eq/L were made. The specified range of concentrations was taking into account the content of heavy metals in the wastewater of the mining enterprise of Kamchatka region. Sorption isotherms are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The sorption capacity of zeolite increases with metal ions concentration The ions of heavy metals in the order of sorption capacity increasing are as follows: Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>&gt;Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>&gt;Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>&gt;Co
 <sup>2+</sup>. The calculation of sorption characteristics for every studied ion was made by the equations of Langmuir (2) and Freundlich (4). Sorption isotherms built as coordinates of linear equation of Langmuir (3) and Freundlich (5) are presented on the plot (Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and
