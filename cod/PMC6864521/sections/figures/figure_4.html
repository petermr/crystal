 <caption> Anisotropy (open circles, red curve) and absorption (black curve) of several colloidal nanostructures: a) CdSe sphere (5 nm); b) CdSe/CdS dot‐in‐rod (5.1 × 35 nm; 3.8 nm core); c) CdSe/CdS rod‐in‐rod (5.2 × 45 nm; 3.8 × 9.0 nm core); d) CdSe nanoplatelet. e) A scheme showing absorption and emission polarizations attainable for ideal dots, rods and platelets. f) Comparison of optical anisotropy in different samples of CdSe/CdS dot‐in‐rods with varying core and shell dimensions. Medium core, long thin shell corresponds to 5.1 × 35 nm shell with a 3.8 nm core. Small core, large shell corresponds to 6.5 × 12 nm shell with a 2.3 nm core. Large core, small shell corresponds to 4.9 × 18 nm with a 4.6 nm core. g) Solution anisotropy (open squares) and absorbance (solid lines) of three samples of CdSe nanoplatelets with identical thickness and different lateral dimensions: 3.9 × 8.8 nm for “short,” 7.1 × 17 nm for “medium” and 8.7 × 29 nm for “long.” Reproduced with permission. 14 Copyright 2015, American Chemical Society. </caption>
