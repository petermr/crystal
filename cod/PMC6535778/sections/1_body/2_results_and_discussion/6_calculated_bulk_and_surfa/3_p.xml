<p>As was designed, EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits interesting surface states. To understand the surface states of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, surface spectral weight simulations consistent with the practice used in the topological materials field were employed. (The first BZ of the rhombohedral lattice is shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00202/suppl_file/oc9b00202_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S2</ext-link>.) The (001) surface is our material’s clear cleavage plane. The (001) surface may be terminated by Eu, P, or Sn atomic layers; surface states are visible for all three possible (001) terminations in the calculations. Consistent with the full bulk DFT calculations, the electronic behavior near

 <sub>F</sub> in these calculations is predominantly determined by the dispersion of hybridized bands from Sn and P orbitals. For Sn-terminated and Eu-terminated surfaces, comparison of the bulk and surface calculations (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>) shows that surface states are located in the bulk energy gap around the Γ point. The energy dispersion of these states is very similar to the Dirac surface states of strong Tis (inset of 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>D–F). The surface states are more well-separated in 
 <italic>k</italic> for the P-termination case (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>E) than they are for the Sn- and Eu-termination cases. This should make them more observable experimentally than for the case of WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, where they are strongly confined in both energy and wavevector.
