<p>The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the magnesium metal thin films were also fabricated to characterize the passivation layer. The thin film fabrication was carried out using a magnetron sputtering coater (Pascal) equipped with 2″ of magnesium and bismuth target. Since the load-lock is directly connected to the argon-filled glove box, the thin films can be prepared without air exposure. We employed a copper foil as substrate of the thin film electrode. The native oxide layer of the copper substrate was removed by sputter etching at 20 W for 20 min. The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin films were fabricated by co-sputtering process of magnesium and bismuth. The rf power was 50 and 20 W for the magnesium and the bismuth respectively. The sputtering duration was 15 min. The substrate was heated at 200°C and rotated at 10 rpm to obtain uniform coatings. Thin films of the magnesium metal were also fabricated almost same sputtering condition above. The sputtering duration is increased to 20 min without the sputtering of the bismuth. The thickness of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film is ≈500 nm.
