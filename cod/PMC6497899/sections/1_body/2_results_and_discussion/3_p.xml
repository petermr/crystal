<p id="Par38">The PL lifetimes of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> and Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> were measured using TRPL. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, the decay curve of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> is fitted well by an exponential function and the lifetime is 375 ns, which is in good accordance with the previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As for Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QDs, the lifetime is longer (1.7 ms), which supports that it originates from the spin-forbidden ligand field transition of the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions [
