 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a)</xref> shows the 2D mapping of Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> and Li 1
 <italic>s</italic> photoemission spectra integrated over the energy region from 47.5 to 71.5 eV of a single crystalline LCO particle after Li extraction by a charge reaction. The intensity of the left side of the LCO particle was higher than that of the plate area and other sides. This was because of the geometrical relationships between the photoelectron analyzer and incident beam spot on the sample. The Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> and Li 1
 <italic>s</italic> spectra integrated over the strong intensity region (red square) of the left side and weak intensity region (black circle) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref>. Li/Co atomic ratios for the two regions can be obtained by integrating the Gaussian fits for each Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> and Li 1
 <italic>s</italic> core level and were corrected with the photoionization cross sections of Li 1
 <italic>s</italic> (0.0023 Mb) and Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> (0.061 Mb) for an incident energy of 1041 eV

 </sup>. The Li/Co ratios were calculated to be 1.2 and 2.8 for the red square and black circle, respectively. It was considered that the lower lithium ratio of the edge region than that of the flat-center region meant that Li in the edge region was easily extracted. These results indicated that our microscopic photoelectron spectroscopy system could clearly distinguish the electronic structure of a selected part of each active single crystalline LCO particle even under 
 <italic>operando</italic> condition. In addition, the spectra at each partition exhibit similar morphology when monitored by the Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> region, in spite of different ratios of Li to Co, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref>. This result implies that the Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> spectrum is not drastically changed by the Li insertion and extraction. From these results, photoelectron mapping by the 3DnanoESCA station is useful to derive position-dependent information of the chemical and electronic states for each element.
