<p>Vacuum elimination of Him from 
 <bold>2</bold> or 
 <bold>5</bold> was performed to achieve interconversion between the five- and six-coordinate complexes.

 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>, respectively. The thermal gravimetric analysis of 
 <bold>2</bold> shows loss of water from 30 to 70 °C and large weight loss above 170 °C, and that of 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibits weight loss above 150 °C. When the microcrystalline sample of 
 <bold>2</bold> was subjected to vacuum at 185 °C, photoemission gradually weakened. After the vacuum elimination reaction for 6 days, no yellow-green luminescence was visible by naked eyes. In the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, the signals of Him are not appeared in the obtained complex. The IR spectrum of the complex agrees to that of 
 <bold>1</bold> as shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02749/suppl_file/ao9b02749_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S1</ext-link>. Therefore, conversion of 
 <bold>2</bold> to 
 <bold>1</bold> was carried out under vacuum at 185 °C. The complex 
 <bold>1</bold> was also produced from 
 <bold>5</bold> by vacuum elimination of Him at 185 °C. As shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02749/suppl_file/ao9b02749_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S12</ext-link>, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the obtained complexes were not agreed with that of 
 <bold>1</bold> which was prepared from the vacuum elimination reaction of (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>MeOH]. This would be because the molecular packing of 
 <bold>1</bold> in the solid depends on the starting material in the vacuum elimination of the ligand at the axial site.
