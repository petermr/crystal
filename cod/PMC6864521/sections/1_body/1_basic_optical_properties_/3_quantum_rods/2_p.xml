<p>Semiconductor QRs
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> are 1D nanomaterials which, unlike 0D QDs, offer the added advantage of polarized emission. Polarized emission sources are able to significantly improve the optical efficiency of LCDs since only photons with their electric field aligned parallel to the LC polarization can pass through the device. A related material set is the 2D nanoplatelets,

 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> which are not considered here, but have been reported with polarized edge emission, though these are more difficult to align in an LCD.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Anisotropic optical properties in QRs, including an increased absorption along the long axis of the rod, and partially polarized emission can be explained by the anisotropic electric field strength along different dimensions. It has been established that a structure with an anisotropic shape will attenuate electric fields perpendicular to the long axis.[qv: 15b] However, polarization in CdSe/CdS dot‐in‐rods and rod‐in‐rods goes beyond what can be explained by simple dielectric effects. The additional anisotropy originates from the splitting of the exciton fine structure in the wurtzite CdSe core.
