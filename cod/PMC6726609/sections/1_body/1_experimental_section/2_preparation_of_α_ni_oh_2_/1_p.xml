<p id="Par7">The amount of nickel nitrate and urea used in the synthesis of heterojunction nanorods is the same as that of cobalt nitrate and urea, and the reaction temperature and solvent conditions are also similar to that used in the synthesis of cobalt hydroxide. The difference is that the second reaction takes less time than the first, which consume only 30 min. After the same operation and drying as the previous experiment, the weight of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanorods was about 1.4 mg by subtracting the weight of Ni foam.
