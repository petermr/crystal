<p>Elemental compositions of the CsPb(Br

  <italic>x</italic>

 <sub>3</sub> powder samples were determined by an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>. Herein, the nominal and actual molar ratios of I/(Br + I) were defined as 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>n</sub> and 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub>, respectively. The measured compositional ratio of Cs/Pb/(Br + I) was 1:1:3, which corresponded to the stoichiometric ratio of CsPb(Br
 <sub>1–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>I
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> for each of the samples. The value of 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> increased monotonically with increasing 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>n</sub>, as plotted in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>. We found a tendency for 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> to be smaller than 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>n</sub>, possibly due to the higher reactivity of Br
 <sup>–</sup> than that of I
 <sup>–</sup> (
