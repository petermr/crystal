 <caption> (a) The PL spectra of the WLED containing the drop-cast PVP/N-CDot films and inorganic red phosphor as color conversion layers over a 450 nm blue LED chip. The amounts of N-CDots and red phosphor within the composite films are varied. (b) The calculated CRI, CCT, LER and luminous flux of the color conversion layers. (c) The CIE color coordinates of the white light generated by the color conversion layers. </caption>
