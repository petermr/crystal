 <caption> Microscopy images of a 1 a crystal in a Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) (gasket diameter ≈400 μ m, a small ruby chip is visible at the lower-left corner). Gradual darkening of the sample with pressure indicates a red-shift in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum. The crystal has been cycled from low to high pressure and back several (six) times, with repeatable results. </caption>
