The HRTEM is for the HEA annealed for 4 days and the simulation evolved structure is taken after 25 MC swaps as at this point the annealed and simulated nanostructures appear very similar in their morphology.

 </sup>. about this HEA, it could be found from HETEM and APT based experiments that the independently evolving isolated SRCs gradually grow in {1 0 0} habit planes and touch each other and make the structure look like total grid pattern after 4 days of annealing. This is analogous to the sequence of simulated structures forming interconnected cross-like grid pattern sequence by reaching 25 MC swaps. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> the real structure SRCs have become fully interconnected with each other to form repetitive domain-like morphologies, dividing the whole space into tiny cuboid-like domains as reproduced in simulations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. However, since the HRTEM does not exclusively provide information about the local nanoscale chemical composition qualitatively or quantitatively, the MC/MD evolved structures are also compared with APT composition scans in Fig.
