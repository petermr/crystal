 <caption> Binding energy E B depending on the π – π distance d between the star cores in the dimer. The literature values [ 17, 44, 48, 57, 58, 59, 60] of the π – π distances of BTA-cored stars (in some of these publications called dendrimers) with various arms are shown as symbols with ordinate E B = −100 kJ mol −1 for convenience. In case of the slipped stacks from the experimental data [ 17], the stars were shifted or rotated so that they segregated in order to evaluate a true π – π distance between their centres. The definition of d is given by the sketch. </caption>
