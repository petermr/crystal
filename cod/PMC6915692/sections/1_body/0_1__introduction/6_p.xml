<p>The as-prepared particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The particles were then heat treated at different temperatures and under different oxygen partial pressures to show the influence of these treatments on their chemical composition (control of the x sub-stoichiometric coefficient in WO
 <sub>3-x</sub> oxides), the obtained crystallographic structure, their morphology (particle size and shape) and their optical properties. Achievement of NPs with enhanced photochromic properties is finally discussed in regard of the recent progresses on the photochromic behavior of WO
 <sub>3</sub> NPs in literature. The enhanced photochromic activity of the WO
 <sub>3</sub> NPs obtained by polyol shown in this study represents a promising step towards scaled-up production of WO
 <sub>3</sub>-based thin films for smart windows or UV-sensing application.
