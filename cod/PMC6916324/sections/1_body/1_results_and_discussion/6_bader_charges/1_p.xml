<p>The Bader charges (Table S4‐4, Supporting Information) show for both, MM‐Expt and MM‐DFT, pronounced positive phosphorus (+3.94 e (MM‐Expt) and +3.69 e (MM‐DFT)) and cobalt atoms (+1.98 e (MM‐Expt) and +1.22 e (MM‐DFT) for Co

 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>). As expected, the positive charge from both approaches is slightly higher for the six‐ than for the fivefold coordinated metal atom.
