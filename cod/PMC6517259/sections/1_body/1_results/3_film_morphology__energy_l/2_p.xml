<p id="p0080">To have a better understanding on the energy level alignment of O5H-OMeDPA with respect to the perovskite, UV photoelectron spectroscopy measurement was performed for the spin-coated thin films on an FTO glass. From the onset (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S10</xref>, we derived the HOMO energy level of solid O5H-OMeDPA, being −5.29 eV, which is 0.16 eV lower than −5.13 eV for spiro-OMeTAD. Compared with the bare perovskite film, photoluminescence (PL) was strongly quenched for the O5H-OMeDPA-coated sample, with a PL quenching (hole extraction) yield of 97.0% (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C), which is almost the same as the sample with spiro-OMeTAD (96.3%). The pristine perovskite film presents a long PL lifetime of 1.99 μs. The PL lifetime of an O5H-OMeDPA-coated perovskite film is reduced to 33.8 ns (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D), slightly shorter than that of the spiro-OMeTAD control (58.1 ns). Given the smaller driving force, the faster kinetics and higher yield of hole extraction suggest a stronger electronic coupling of O5H-OMeDPA with the perovskite than spiro-OMeTAD.
