<p>Although bond‐valence sums
 <xref rid="open201900287-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> clearly indicate iron(III) and all hydrogen position could be identified in difference Fourier maps and refined without restraints (except for their occupancies), we measured 
 <sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer spectra of

  <bold>K</bold>

 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) could be well reproduced with one signal with an isomer shift of 
 <italic>δ</italic>=0.085(2) mm ⋅ s
 <sup>−1</sup> at 293 K and 
 <italic>δ</italic>=0.194(1) mm ⋅ s
 <sup>−1</sup> at 6 K (Table 
 <xref rid="open201900287-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The small differences in the isomer shifts is a consequence of the second order Doppler shift. The total isomer shift can be described as the sum of the electric monopole interaction and the second order Doppler shift which depends on the mean square of velocity of the nucleus.
