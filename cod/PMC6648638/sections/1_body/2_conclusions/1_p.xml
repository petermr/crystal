<p>In this study, oleic acid-capped CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs were incorporated into an aliphatic acrylate polymer by the solution mixing method, followed by photopolymerization. The small amounts of QD clusters were uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix. The prepared nanocomposite consisted of 0.1 wt % of CdSe/ZnS QDs showing stable optical properties, achieving high white LED performance of 7976 lm/m
 <sup>2</sup> under a 30 mA working current. The light emission efficiency, CRI, and the color temperature of 14%, 47, and 11 204 K, were obtained at this current. Meanwhile, the incorporation of a small amount of QDs improved the thermal stability of the polymer matrix. These results are important for the practical application of electroluminescent LED devices using the QD package.
