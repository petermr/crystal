<p>POWGEN has an extremely versatile scientific portfolio at present. However, the upgrade has opened several additional avenues which are somewhat less explored. It is expected that, owing to the large 
 <italic>d</italic> spacings which can be easily accessed using longer wavelength bands on POWGEN, it will be ideally suited for large-structure refinements such as metal organic frameworks (Trickett 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb40"> ▸</xref>) and zeolites (Latshaw 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb21"> ▸</xref>), and in the future, it is expected that one will be able to investigate gas absorption in these materials. The access to low 
 <italic>Q</italic> also makes it an ideal instrument to study magnetic structures. Several such studies have already been done at the instrument (Li 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb22"> ▸</xref>; Hona 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> ▸</xref>; Allred 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb2"> ▸</xref>), and their number is expected to continue to grow.
