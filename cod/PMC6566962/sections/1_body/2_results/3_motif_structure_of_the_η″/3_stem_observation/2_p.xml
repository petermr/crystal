 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(b</xref>) shows an atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image of the η phase with the [100]
 <italic>
  <sub>Cmcm</sub>
 </italic> incidence. The corresponding [100]
 <italic>
  <sub>Cmcm</sub>
 </italic> projection of the crystal structure for the η phase reported by Burkhardt et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>] is shown in 
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(a</xref>). While Fe atoms in the Fe sites and Al atoms in the Al1 sites with full occupancy forming the FeAl
 <sub>2</sub> framework structure exhibit a well-defined asymmetric dumbbell pattern (Fe: brighter, Al1: darker), Al atoms at the Al2 and Al3 sites with partial occupancy in the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain do not exhibit any noticeable brightness contrast in the image. In the HAADF-STEM image of the η″ phase (Al-30.0 at.%Fe) with the equivalent [010]
 <italic>
  <sub>C2/m</sub>
 </italic> incidence (
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(c</xref>)), on the other hand, bright spots are observed at positions corresponding to every fourth of the Al2 sites along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain for the η phase, as indicated by yellow arrows. This is a clear indication that the Al (and Fe) atoms are arranged in the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis chain in an ordered manner, forming the monoclinic unit cell of the motif structure of the η″ phase with the space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2
 <italic>/m</italic>, as outlined with magenta lines in 
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(c</xref>). The positions of these bright spots, indicated by yellow arrows, correspond to the Wyckoff 2
 <italic>a</italic> sites in the doubled monoclinic unit cell of the motif superlattice structure (right part of 
 <xref rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). As will be described later in 
 <xref rid="S0003-S2003-S3002">Section 3.3.2</xref>, SXRD indicates that a part of the Al3 sites is also occupied by Al atoms in an ordered manner, although they are not visible in the HAADF-STEM image of 
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(c</xref>) due to their large atomic displacement parameters (
 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(c</xref>)).
