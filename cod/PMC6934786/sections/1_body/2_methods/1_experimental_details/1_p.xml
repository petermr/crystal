 </sup>. High purity (&gt;99.999%), triple sublimed pentacene has been thermally evaporated to grow thin films. For two terminal devices, 200 nm single layer of pentacene is sandwiched between Al and Au. We fabricate three terminal OFETs with Au source, drain contacts on a 100 nm thick pentacene film grown on n

 <sup>−6</sup> mbar with an extremely low evaporation rate of 0.1 Å/s to minimize structural disorder
