<p>The data presented above suggested that the AE–LCAO-HSE approach is generally the most satisfactory for describing the electronic structure of the stoichiometric and reduced anatase surface. We therefore use this approach to consider the adsorption of H
 <sub>2</sub>Pc on anatase (101). In this calculation we also include the effects of London dispersion interactions through the empirical Grimme D3 correction, as these are likely to play a role in the molecule-surface binding. Initial geometries with the molecule placed centered on O

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. Local minima are found at both sites. It is perhaps surprising to observe the significant changes in the molecular structure of H
 <sub>2</sub>Pc induced when it is centered on O

 </sub>. The molecule becomes non–co–planar and the C-H rings move away from the surface by 0.3–0.4 Å with respect to the central atoms of the molecule, which makes clear the strong repulsion between these rings and the O

  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>. The reason for this behavior can be the strength of the C-H bond which makes it relatively unreactive. However, the N atoms from the molecule interact strongly with the surface Ti atom, resulting in the N atom placed just on top of the Ti

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) moving closer to the surface by 0.3 Å, with respect to the rest of the N in the molecule.
