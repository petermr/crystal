 </sup> This phase was shown to increase the width of the Raman carbonate symmetrical stretching band at 1093 cm
 <sup>â€“1</sup> in addition to the appearance of a new sulfate band. A similar increase in the FWHM of the carbonate band was observed in our sulfate experiments, however, no new band was observed in the vibrational spectroscopy data. The XRD analysis of zabuyelite synthesized in the experiments also showed no changes in the peak location or consistent increase of the FWHM. Therefore, if sulfate was incorporated into zabuyelite it is below the detection limit of the XRD and Raman spectrometer. The presence of sulfate during nucleation and growth can lead to the stabilization of different Ca-carbonate polymorphs.

 </sup> Thus, the increase in FWHM of the carbonate symmetrical stretching band indicates that a less crystalline material was produced, potentially due to sulfate disrupting the transformation of the precursor phase.
