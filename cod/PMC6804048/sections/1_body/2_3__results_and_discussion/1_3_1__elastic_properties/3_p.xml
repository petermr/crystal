<p>In a tetragonal phase C
 <sub>11</sub>, C
 <sub>12</sub> and C
 <sub>33</sub> correspond to the linear compression resistance along the a, b and c axis. In all cases C
 <sub>11</sub> and C
 <sub>33</sub> are the highest values. This indicates that linear compression along these axes should be lower. The smallest difference between C
 <sub>11</sub> and C
 <sub>33</sub> is for the Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>X phases, suggesting that these are less anisotropic than the Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>X phases. If these values are compared with the binary βNb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub> phase [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which has the D8
 <sub>m</sub> structure, the difference between C
 <sub>11</sub> and C
 <sub>33</sub> is in all cases smaller (between 10 and 30 GPa for ternary phases compared with approximately 60 GPa for βNb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub>). In beta Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub>, the 8 h and 4a Wyckoff positions are filled with Si atoms, whereas in the ternary phase, the 8h position contains Sn atoms. This suggests that the presence of a large, element such as Sn, in the 8h Wyckoff position reduces the anisotropy of the W
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub> phase.
