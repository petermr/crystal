 <caption> Lattice parameters of geometrically optimized supercells (PBEsol-D) for Al/Si ordering patterns AS1, AS2 ( x &lt; 1/3) and AS3 ( x &gt; 1/3). Experimental values of a, b and c based on X-ray diffraction measurements are taken from Cameron (1977 a ▸), Klug et al. (1987 ▸), Ban &amp; Okada (1992 ▸) for mullite and from Yang et al. (1997 ▸) for sillimanite ( x = 0). Several experimental values of a are ‘hidden’ behind the data points of the DFT calculations. </caption>
