<p>For the synthesis of CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles by the polymer-assisted sol–gel method, a specific amount of PVP (ratio 1:1 with the aimed CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> mass) was first dissolved in 200 mL of distilled water under stirring at room temperature for 2 h. Then, stoichiometric amounts of each nitrate precursor were added, and the solution was further stirred at room temperature for three additional hours. After this, the homogeneous solution was heated at 80 °C for 24 h in a furnace to dry the sample and polymerize the gelling agent. Thus, a solid gel containing a homogeneous distribution of the metal ions was obtained. To eliminate the organic matter and obtain the desired oxide, the gel was burned at 250 °C for 15 min in a furnace. The obtained product was further ground to powder, and finally, calcination was done to allow the ferrite formation. The calcination conditions are later specified for each sample, as these are the parameters optimized by the DoE.
