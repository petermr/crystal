 <italic>Fabrication of the Wind Speed Sensor</italic>: The wind speed sensor was composed of four parts, including a cylinder, a hollow ring with four cross‐shaped ridges for adhesion, a perovskite‐based PD, and a round base. Except for the TIEL material, the other parts were all fabricated by 3D printing technology with resin material. The sizes of the cylinder, four cross‐shaped ridges, and the hollow ring were 5 × 3 × 0.2 cm
 <sup>3</sup>, 1 × 0.75 × 0.4 cm
 <sup>3</sup>, and 1 × 1.5 × 0.2 cm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively. The inlet and outlet for the wind to flow through the device were 6.3 and 4.4 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. The area of perovskite‐based PD was 1.2 × 1.2 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, which was fixed onto the round base with four channels for wind convection.
