<p>Similarly, the PT processes with the second and third highest rates, namely intra-surface-PT and inter-surface-PT, can also be concatenated to yield net diffusion along the polar ±[0001] direction (“rectangular” diffusion along the green lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Diffusion along ±[0001] thus occurs when the PHC alternately jumps back and forth between two surface rows. Net diffusion along the nonpolar ±[11[combining macron]00] directions occurs 
 <italic>via</italic> intra-adlayer-PT events and solvent-assisted PT events (thin blue and pink lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Such PT events transfer the PHC from one Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> to another Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> on the “other side” of the same surface row. Unlike the case at ZnO(101[combining macron]0), it is not only solvent-assisted PT events that enable PHC diffusion along the “minor” direction, but intra-adlayer-PT events also contribute to such diffusion. For this reason, it is not surprising that the one-dimensional diffusion coefficients at ZnO(112[combining macron]0) in both directions are much more similar in magnitude (differing only by a factor of 3, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7b</xref>) than what is the case at ZnO(101[combining macron]0).
