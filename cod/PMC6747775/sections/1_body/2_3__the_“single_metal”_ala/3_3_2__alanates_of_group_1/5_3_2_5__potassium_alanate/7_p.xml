<p>The experimental dehydrogenation enthalpies for reactions (34) and (35) are 70 ± 2 and 81 ± 2 kJ/mol H
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B167-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. A phase diagram was generated with these values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02724-f010">Figure 10</xref>). In this diagram, the feasibility of hydrogenation at low pressure is evident and it justifies the rehydrogenation without the need for a catalyst or additives.
