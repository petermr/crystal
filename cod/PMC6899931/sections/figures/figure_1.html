 <caption> a) Polished surface of the MgSi 5 sample (back‐scattering‐electron scanning electron microscopy image) with arrays of equally oriented domains of MgSi 5 (light gray), separated by thin Si layers (dark gray); black frames show the positions of the FIB cuts. b) Surface image after extracting the first FIB cut. c) Second FIB cut soldered to the copper holder. d) Transmission electron microscopy image of a FIB lamella (perpendicular to [001]) showing the area used for electron diffraction tomography (circle). The inset shows the aperture. </caption>
