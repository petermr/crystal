<p>This review offers a comprehensive discussion of the potential use of down‐conversion colloidal nanomaterials for LCD applications. After introducing basic optical properties of QDs and QRs, we will consider various assembly strategies for QRs, with a particular emphasis on assembling anisotropic materials to obtain polarized emission in the ensemble. Finally, we will present QD‐ and QR‐based device architectures and highlight several concepts that emerge from the wide variety of light‐emitting materials that are now feasible for these applications.</p>
