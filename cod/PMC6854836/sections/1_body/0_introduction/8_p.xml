<p>Salvador et al. argued that a liquid Ga environment was necessary to stabilize β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, which apparently is not accessible by conventional synthetic routes (as used for the synthesis of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>).

 </sup> Later studies showed that also liquid In and Sn environments promote the formation of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
 </sup> and it was proposed that to obtain β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, the formation of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> had to be completely bypassed.

 </sup> Generally, metal fluxes may allow for kinetic control in the synthesis of solids
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
 </sup> and/or access to low-temperature modifications for which rates of formation can be insignificant when using solid reactants. Thus, one may suspect that β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> represents a metastable and/or low-temperature form of SiB
 <sub>3</sub>. However, a transition from β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> to α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> has never been observed. Instead, β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> has been shown to be extraordinarily temperature-stable (refractory).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
 </sup> So, how does then β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> (thermodynamically) relate to α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, and—given the long history of B–Si investigations—why has it not been observed earlier? In this work, we establish the formation conditions for both α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> from binary elemental mixtures. We further bracket the composition of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and show that this phase is metastable with respect to β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> at high temperatures.
