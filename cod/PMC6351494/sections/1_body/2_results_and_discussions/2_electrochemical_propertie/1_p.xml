<p>In order to investigate the correlation between the electrochemical properties of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the surface layer, Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film electrodes were fabricated by magnetron sputtering process. An SEM image and an XRD pattern of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The SEM image shows a polycrystalline Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film having 200–300 nm of secondary particles. The diffraction pattern of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film well matches with the powder pattern discussed in the previous section. Since the fabrication process does not have post annealing process, the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film has slightly poor crystallinity. The small peak observed at 22.6° of 2θ is corresponding the 003 reflection of the bismuth remained as impurity phase. The peak of 012 reflection of the bismuth, which is the main peak of the powder pattern, is not clearly observed, hence the bismuth impurity phase has a preferred orientation to c-axis to minimize the surface energy during the deposition process.
