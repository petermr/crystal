<p>2D perovskites with Sn and Ge are known to have smaller bandgaps than Pb‐based perovskites.[qv: 15d,38,52,83,100] For example, the bandgap of PEA
 <sub>2</sub>SnI
 <sub>4</sub> is 2.19 eV, while that of PEA
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> is 2.62 eV.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref> The binding energies of excitons have also been reported to decrease from 230 to 160–190 meV for these two 2D perovskites.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref> Recently, Zeng's group obtained the bandgap of BA
 <sub>2</sub>MI
 <sub>4</sub> (M = Ge, Sn, and Pb) by theoretical calculations. The bandgaps of BA
 <sub>2</sub>GeI
 <sub>4</sub>, BA
 <sub>2</sub>SnI
 <sub>4</sub>, and BA
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> are 1.74, 1.45, and 1.96 eV, respectively. BA
 <sub>2</sub>GeI
 <sub>4</sub> is more affected than BA
 <sub>2</sub>SnI
 <sub>4</sub> and BA
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> by the distorted MI
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra, which resulted from the reduced coordination symmetry around the cations by unbonded lone pair electrons.

 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d that the bandgap reduces with the increase of Sn component. When 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5, the smallest bandgap is 1.95 eV. A partial substitution of Sn not only reduces the bandgap, but also improves the conductivity, and the improvement of moisture stability of (PEA)

 <sub>0.5</sub>I
 <sub>4</sub> is caused by the addition of PEA with hydrophobic groups, which is more helpful as a light‐absorbing material in solar cells.
