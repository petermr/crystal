<p>In comparing the calculated results of SGS as an example to the results calculated by Zekry F. Ghatas in 2008 through his study of the assessment and analysis of traffic noise pollution in Alexandria city, Egypt; the maximum noise level value was 90.4 dB, the minimum noise level value was 60.2 dB and the mean equivalent noise level was 80.3 dB while in this study they were 96.8 dB, 60.1 dB and 86.67 correspondingly. It is notices that there is a remarkable increase in the noise levels through the past 10 years and this could be subjected to the massive change in the land use and layout of Elgiesh road that occurred in this station.</p>
