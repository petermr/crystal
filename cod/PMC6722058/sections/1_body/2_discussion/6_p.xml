<p id="Par31">Our future work will be directed to developing more numerically effective methods for evaluating the candidate structures, which eventually could reduce the need to use a large number of heavy total energy evaluations at the DFT level. Our goal is also to extend the structural prediction of metal-ligand interfaces into the metal atoms and complete cluster structures, bypassing then the need to parametrize classical force fields for complex hybrid nanomaterials. We hope that the method described in this work can open new avenues for effective structural predictions of nanoparticles and more generally nanomaterials where the atomic-scale information of the metal-ligand interface is crucial to understand growth mechanisms, stability, dynamics and ensuing physico-chemical properties. As such, our work is complementary to recent efforts to develop understanding of gold nanoparticle synthesis via deep learning
