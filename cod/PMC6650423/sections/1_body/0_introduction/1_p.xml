 <italic>d</italic>-wave superconductivity, and the phase fluctuations of preformed Cooper pairs destroy the superconducting order. In the latter scenario, the pseudogap emerges as a consequence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking. A continuous phase transition at

 <sup>*</sup> is often argued to imply the presence of a quantum critical point, with associated fluctuations that may give rise to the high-

 <sub>c</sub> superconductivity and strange-metal behaviours. Furthermore, the pseudogap order is thought to be intertwined (or compete) with other types of order, such as CDW order
