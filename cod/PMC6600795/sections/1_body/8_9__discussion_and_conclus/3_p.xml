<p>The validity of the Cauchy-Born conjecture has been proven to be correct. How far in the deformation range this assertion is correct? The digital moir√© applied to the dislocation area shows that, in the sense of RVE, continuum mechanics variables can be utilized to predict actual dislocation kinematic variables. In conclusion, continuum mechanics is a powerful tool that can predict in the statistical sense, as a homogenization tool, the behavior of a metal crystalline structure under general deformation conditions.</p>
