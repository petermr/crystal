<p>The optical properties have major influence on the solar cell materials; thus, we study the absorption properties of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> material by employing optical dielectric function ε(ω) = ε
 <sub>1</sub>(ω) + iε
 <sub>2</sub>(ω). The dielectric function is contingent on the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation, and it is related to the interaction between photons and electrons. The absorption coefficient of the material is highly influenced by the imaginary part ε
 <sub>2</sub>(ω), and it can be determined from the inter-band optical transitions by summing over the unoccupied states using the equation [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The real part ε
 <sub>1</sub>(ω) of dielectric function can be calculated from the ε
 <sub>2</sub>(ω) by Kramer-Kronig relationship [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The calculated imaginary part of the dielectric function and absorption coefficients of the TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> compound are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f004">Figure 4</xref>. According to the directional dependency of ε
 <sub>1</sub>(ω) and ε
 <sub>2</sub>(ω), we can conclude that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is an anisotropic material to the optical properties. Therefore, we present both the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f004">Figure 4</xref> along x and z-directions.
