  <p>Correlations among the Pb displacements. 
   <bold>a</bold> Clusters of Pb atoms having a local displacement-alignment metric 
   <italic>α</italic> (see text) for the first Pb–Pb coordination sphere less than 45° (spatially distinct clusters are labeled using different colors). As a reference, 
   <italic>α</italic> = 0° and 
   <italic>α</italic> = 180° correspond to the parallel and antiparallel displacements of a given atom and its neighbors, respectively. The clusters have been identified according to the HDBSCAN
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
   </sup> algorithm. The search procedure accounted for the periodic boundary conditions; however, for visualization purposes, we assigned a distinct color to each region within the configuration box. 
   <bold>b</bold> Magnitudes of the Pb displacements plotted against 
   <italic>α</italic>; a strong negative correlation between the two characteristics is observed. The inset illustrates variation of the displacement magnitude for the Pb columns across the 
   <italic>α</italic>-PNR boundary, as derived from panel 
   <bold>c</bold>. 
   <bold>c</bold> A 2D map of displacements for the Pb columns projected onto a {110} plane; the color-scale bar reflects the displacement magnitude in Å and the arrows are used to illustrate the displacement directions. The 
   <italic>x</italic> and 
   <italic>y</italic> axes correspond to the orthogonal [110] and [001] directions. This distribution agrees with the analogous maps deduced from experimental atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy images of PbMg
   <sub>1/3</sub>Nb
   <sub>2/3</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub>. The displacements decay monotonically toward the boundaries. 
   <bold>d</bold> 3D rendering of a representative 
   <italic>α</italic>-PNR, with the constituent Pb atoms (represented by spheres) that are displaced along the inequivalent 〈111〉 directions (labeled in the figure) indicated using different colors
