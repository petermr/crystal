 </sup> magnesite (MgCO
 <sub>3</sub>) surfaces both at room temperature and 90 Â°C. As Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> also has a strong attraction for water molecules similar to Li
 <sup>+</sup>, it is likely that sulfate will also interact with zabuyelite surfaces. Indeed, the computational models predict that sulfate will bind directly to zabuyelite surfaces, unlike the other ions tested. Adsorption to the {110} surfaces, however, increased the surface energy leading to a lower contribution of this surface in the equilibrium morphology (

 </xref>f). The decrease in the stability of this surface through the adsorption of sulfate could be the reason for the small size of this surface on the crystals precipitated in the experiments. The shift of the sulfate symmetrical stretching band in the ATR-IR measurements is consistent with the adsorption of sulfate to mineral surfaces.

 </sup> Therefore, this implies that sulfate can directly adsorb to the zabuyelite surface as predicted by the computational simulations. However, it is not possible to identify adsorption to specific surfaces from the ATR-IR data. Similarly, the significant overlap of the sulfate band by the carbonate bands of zabuyelite prevent the determination of the dominant adsorption mode on the zabuyelite surfaces.
