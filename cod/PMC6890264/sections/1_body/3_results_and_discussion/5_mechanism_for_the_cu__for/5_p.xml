<p>As mentioned above, the steric demands of all three phosphines used in the present work are essentially the same (viz., 128° for DPP and TPP, 132° for TOP),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
 </sup> and therefore, steric effects are not expected to play a significant role in the outcome of the cation exchange reactions. However, Tolman cone angles are just a first approximation as they do not take into account the effect of different M–P bond lengths, different metal centers, and the overall interaction with other ligands coordinated to the same metal center.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>
 </sup> Therefore, actual cone angles obtained from X-ray structural data (the so-called solid cone angles) typically deviate from the Tolman cone angles, varying over a wide range depending on the nature of the metal center and bond length (shorter bonds result in larger cone angles).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>
 </sup> For example, the solid cone angles determined for triphenylphosphine complexes range from 129 to 168°,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>
 </sup> whereas the Tolman cone angle of triphenylphosphine is 145°.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> In the case of Ni complexes, a slightly larger solid cone angle has been reported for TPP with respect to DPP complexes (135 and 124°, respectively),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> consistent with the bulkier nature of the former (containing three phenyl groups) with respect to the latter (which contains only two phenyl groups). If the impact of steric effects on the outcome of the cation exchange reactions were significant, one would expect a difference between the reactivity of the complexes using TPP and DPP as ligands, in contrast with our experimental data, which show that GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP have similar reactivities. This implies that the kinetics of the cation exchange reactions studied in our work are primarily dictated by the electronic properties of the phosphine ligands used, which determine the Ga–P bond strength of the resulting Lewis acid–base adduct complexes with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> and the geometry of the activated Cu
 <sub>2–

 </sub>S–GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–L complex that forms at the surface of the Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S NC at the onset of the cation exchange reaction. After the place exchange between the outgoing Cu
 <sup>+</sup> and the incoming Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> cations has taken place, the two chlorides still bound to the incorporated Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> cation will react with two neighboring Cu
 <sup>+</sup> cations, extracting them from the NC surface as neutral CuCl units, which are highly soluble in the apolar reaction medium used in our experiments (

 </xref>c, step 4). This likely increases the thermodynamic driving force of the overall CE reaction both entropically and enthalpically as two more chemical species are released in solution and solvated.

 </sup> The two Cu
 <sup>+</sup> vacancies left will further promote the CE reaction by allowing more Cu
 <sup>+</sup> cations to diffuse to the surface, while allowing the incorporated Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> guest cation to diffuse inward. As previously shown for CE reactions in copper chalcogenide NCs, the CE rates increase with increasing concentration of Cu
 <sup>+</sup> vacancies.
