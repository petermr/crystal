<p id="p0215">Taking into account that NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> is considered as an indirect band-gap semiconductor, while Ca
 <sub>2</sub>Nb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> is a direct band gap semiconductor. We have evaluated graphically the band gap of the samples from the primary optical transition (
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>c,d). The obtained values are 3.11 and 3.26 eV for NCN0.10 and NCN0.25, respectively. Since NCN0.55 contains both compounds in nearly equal proportions, its TAUC plot curve has two linear sections (
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>c). These intervals have been approached separately, giving 3.28 eV (the evaluation as the indirect band gap semiconductor, Fig. 14c) and 3.68 eV (as the direct band gap material, 
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>d). The band gap of NCN1.00 has been found to be 4.28 eV (
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>d). The obtained values comply well with known optical properties of both NaNbO
 <sub>3</sub> and Ca
 <sub>2</sub>Nb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>. Large values of the band gap make the direct use of these materials as photocatalysts under visible light less likely, although, both NCN0.10 and NCN0.25 appear to be promising in this regard, and worth of further studies.
