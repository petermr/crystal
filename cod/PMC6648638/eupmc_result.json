    "White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been achieved using photopolymerization. Red and green CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) are dispersed in photopolymerized aliphatic acrylic acrylate resins, cured by using 36 W UV light for 1.5 min producing QD-acrylate nanocomposites, and then a hybrid LED device is achieved using the QD-acrylate nanocomposite with two emission wavelengths excited by using a blue InGaN LED chip. The cured QD-acrylate nanocomposite films are characterized by using ultraviolet-visible, fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis measurements. Photopolymerization is conveniently employed to adjust several parameters of the CIE-1931 coordinate (x, y), color temperature, and color rending index (CRI). Good white balance of the red-green hybrid device achieves a luminance of 7976 lm/m2 at a 30 mA working current. The light emission efficiency, CRI, and color temperature of 14%, 47, and 11â€‰204 K, respectively, are attained at this working current."
