 </xref>a–c that the charge density between the B-site cation and apical oxygen increases as the V concentration increases. In PVO, the presence of strong V–O1 bond along with lone pair electrons at the Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> site weakens the Pb–O1 bond. Because of these effects, the Pb atom shifts more toward O2 to maintain the charge balance. Hence, the covalent bonding interaction between Pb and O2 shows an increasing trend, which is evident from 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>d–f as the width of the charge density increases with increase in 
 <italic>x</italic>. These observations indicate that the increase of V concentration in PbTi
