<p>The use of WLEDs, as a well-established component of solid-state lighting, provides a promising strategy to reduce electricity consumption, and WLEDs are expected to replace traditional lighting products in the future [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A WLED mainly consists of a blue or UV LED chip and phosphors as color conversion layers [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A typical configuration is the combination of a color conversion layer composed of yellow phosphors (e.g., cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>)) with a blue LED chip [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, this configuration exhibits a low color rendering index (CRI) due to its red deficiency. Therefore, red phosphors can be integrated into this system to improve the CRI and also to reduce the correlated color temperature (CCT) [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, due to the limitation of rare-earth material resources and the harsh synthesis conditions involved, phosphors are targeted to be replaced by novel materials such as perovskites [
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], organic dyes [
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], quantum dots [
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and CDots [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Among these, CDots are a promising alternative since they are cost effective and optically feasible, making them commercially viable.
