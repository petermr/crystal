We achieved high efficiency and CRI points above 95 through adjusting the peak emission wavelength of UV and blue LEDs, current ratio through the LEDs, and the green/red phosphor mixing ratios. An optimized CRI Ra of 97.3 with an efficiency of 100.12 lm/W and CCT of 2906 K was achieved from the PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LED. The fabricated LEDs were evaluated using TM-30-18 color vector graphics, local Chroma shifts, and fidelity-gamut plot. The newly designed LED PKGs exhibit high fidelity and high saturation values. The LEDs also exhibit high stability and reliability, exhibiting a stable operation up to 1000 h under 378 K, 85% humidity test conditions. Our study on the re-designed LED PKG consisting of one UV LED, two blue LEDs - green and red phosphors paves the way to fabricate and use WLEDs in stadium lighting and UHDTV production where high CRI points, high efficiency, and low power consumption are required.
