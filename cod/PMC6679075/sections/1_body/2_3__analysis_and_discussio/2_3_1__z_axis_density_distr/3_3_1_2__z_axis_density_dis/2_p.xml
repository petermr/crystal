<p>In addition, the charge density of montmorillonite had a significant effect on the distribution of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f003">Figure 3</xref>. With the increase of the layer charge density, the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> moved more significantly from the middle of the layer to the siloxane surface on both sides, as shown in the figure, migration peaks increased or multiple migration peaks appeared. This phenomenon was more pronounced as the proportion of the charge in the tetrahedron increased. The Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> among the layers were subjected to the negative potential electrostatic attraction of the isomorphism of the tetrahedron, causing the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to diffuse to the sides. Since the montmorillonite with higher charge density had a large number of negative potential points, the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer were subjected to strong electrostatic force, and the diffusion to the siloxane surface was more obvious. Therefore, in the same crystal structure of montmorillonite, with the increase of the charge density of montmorillonite, the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> appeared to gradually shift from the vicinity of the central axis to the two sides in the montmorillonite layer.
