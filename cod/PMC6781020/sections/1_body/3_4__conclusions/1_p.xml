<p>The SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs were prepared in the aqueous solution by the hydrolysis and oxidation of SnCl
 <sub>2</sub> source material. The average grain size of the QDs was 2.23 nm from HRTEM observation. The rutile phase SnO
 <sub>2</sub> of the prepared QDs was confirmed from the XRD pattern, HRTEM observation and XPS spectrum. The fluorescence spectra of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs show intensity peaked at an emission wavelength of 300 nm. The SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs showed a fluorescence response to various heavy metal ions and the response of 2.48 was observed to be 100 ppm Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>. The fluorescence performance to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> were evaluated in the background solutions of deionized water, deionized water with Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, reclaimed water and sea water. The limit of detection was as low as 0.01 ppm for Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>. The prepared QDs showed a great potential in the sensor development for the detection of heavy metal ions in contaminated water. The first principle calculation demonstrated that Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> had an adsorption energy of 7.65 and 13.46 eV, respectively. The fluorescence response was found to be dependent on the adsorption energy as well as ion radius of heavy metal ions. The mechanism of fluorescence response was discussed based on the interaction between Sn vacancies and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. The fluorescence emission intensity was formulated as a function of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration. 71% of Sn vacancies on the surface were left vacant, while 29% of them are active to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. The density of active Sn vacancies was the crucial factor that determined the fluorescence response of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs to heavy metal ions.
