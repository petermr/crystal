 </xref>a. The multilayered material is partially sliced and composed of a luminescent layer prepared with PDMS, ZnS:Cu phosphor particles and two TPU electrification layers. The fabrication procedure is illustrated in the Experimental Section. A piece of the as‐fabricated bent ZnS:Cu+PDMS film is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c,d displays the surface and cross‐sectional views of the luminescent layer recorded by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The result suggests that the ZnS:Cu phosphor particles homogeneously dispersed in the PDMS substrate with an estimated average diameter of 20 µm. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted to analyze the elemental compositions of particles within the defined regions as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d. The results (displayed in the inset) reveal the characteristic peaks of ZnS:Cu. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e displays the X‐ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ZnS:Cu powders. It is clear that three major peaks at 28.82°, 48.31°, and 56.0° are detected, indicating the (111), (220), and (311) lattice planes of the zinc‐blended structure, respectively. The wind‐driven TIEL spectrum of the composite material was detected at the light‐emitting section by a spectrometer. The coordinates corresponding to Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) are displayed in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f. The result shows that a green emission is detected at 510 nm, corresponding to the CIE coordinates (0.22, 0.49). Based on the energy level diagram shown (Figure S1, Supporting Information), electrons in the shallow electron trap states of ZnS: Cu would fall into the states of Cu impurity, which emits a green luminescence through recombination under the mechanical activation.
