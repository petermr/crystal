<p>When crystalline materials are analyzed, variations in the hit density on the detector often form a pattern that is specific to the crystalline structure and orientation of the specimen [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This pattern is due to the faceting of the specimen and associated trajectory aberrations [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The appearance of such patterns is usually accompanied by crystallography-related information present within the reconstruted APT data, which can be retrieved and exploited to calibrate a tomographic reconstruction or extract meaningful microstructural information [
