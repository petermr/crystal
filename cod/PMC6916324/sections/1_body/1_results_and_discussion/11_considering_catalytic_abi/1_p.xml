<p>Phosphates, which contain cobalt and other transition metals, are known to catalyze organic reactions and are therefore in the spotlight of current research. The oxidation of styrene, for example, was realized using a nickel–cobalt catalyst.

The maximum catalytic effect was found at a cobalt content of 0.32, which also represents the maximum solubility of Co in calcium phosphate. The reactivity for ethane, propane, butan‐2‐ol, and propanol was studied by Aaddane et al.
