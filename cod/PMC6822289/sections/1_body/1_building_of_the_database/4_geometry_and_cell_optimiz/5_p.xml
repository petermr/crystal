<p>In the way we designed and applied this workchain, it can almost be seen as a chemical sanity check: if a structure does not pass this stage it most likely violates the collective knowledge of quantum chemistry. This either implies DFT to have some severe inaccuracies in modeling the crystal or, what we found in most of the cases, chemical inconsistencies in the initial structure that need to be fixed manually before the structure can be optimized.</p>
