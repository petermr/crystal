 <sup>−1</sup> Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in AN, 0.5 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in BuMeG3, and 0.5 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in dimethoxyethane: G1 (Kishida). The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film shows reversible redox reaction in all the three electrolyte solutions. The redox potentials of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> in 0.5 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in BuMeG3 and G1 are −2.3 to −2.4 V vs. Ag
 <sup>+</sup>/Ag, lower than the redox potential in AN electrolyte solution; we suspect it is due to the difference of the Ag
 <sup>+</sup>/Ag redox potential in the reference electrode corresponding to the solvation properties of AN and the glymes. The broad peaks of the cyclic voltammogram of the BuMeG3 electrolyte solution indicates that the redox reaction is kinetically slow due to the high viscosity of the solution. The overpotential between the anodic and cathodic reaction is ~100 mV, which is slightly higher than that of AN, it is still much lower than the overpotential observed in the deposition/dissolution process of the magnesium metal in these glyme solutions.
