 <caption> Conventional (diffraction contrast) transmission electron microscopy image of the area containing the lamella in the focus ion beam section, which location of extraction is shown in Figure  1. (a) Bright field image showing the lamella between two olivine grains and next to two wadsleyite grains. This area is mapped at the bottom of Figure  2. The small hole results from the ion thinning process. Several cracks are visible which probably result from decompression and/or specimen thinning. (b) Weak‐beam dark‐field image ( g = 004 for olivine and g = 400 for anhydrous phase B) showing that the lamella and the olivine 2 grain are in topotactic relationship and exhibit a network of misfit dislocations at the interface. (c) Bright‐field image from the “olivine 2” grain showing one of the thin lamellae observed within this grain. </caption>
