<p>A novel aspect of this work is not only the development of this workchain but also the full integration between AiiDA and the Materials Cloud. The importance of this integration becomes clear once groups start using our refined structures. For example, for 5% of the structures our workflow did not succeed in obtaining a converged structure because of inconsistencies or errors in the deposited crystal structure. These errors range from missing hydrogen to incorrect labeling of atoms, wrong cell dimensions, etc. The access to the Materials Cloud allows any user to inspect all corrections we have made on the original structure, the outcome of the geometry optimization, and the computed partial charges to be used for molecular simulations. In addition, the reader can find on the Materials Cloud the detailed workchain, i.e., the logic and the input/output files for all programs that have been used to compute and characterize the final structures. These workchains can be downloaded, allowing any researcher to reproduce our results or extend our calculations while maintaining their complete providence. We feel that it is important to create a precedent on the level of transparency and reproducibility that can be obtained.</p>
