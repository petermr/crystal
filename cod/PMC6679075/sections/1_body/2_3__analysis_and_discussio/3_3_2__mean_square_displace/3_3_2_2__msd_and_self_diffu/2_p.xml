<p>In summary, 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02318-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02318-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show that the diffusivity of water molecules among montmorillonite layers was much larger than that of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, but the diffusion coefficient of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> was more affected by the charge position (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f005">Figure 5</xref>), which was because the water molecules were neutral, although the polar side (the side where H was located) would be affected by the negative side of the siloxane surface. However, compared to the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> with positive charge, the polarity of the water molecules was much weaker. Thus, water molecules in the interlayer diffused more easily than Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. As for the influence from an overall point of view, when the charge density of montmorillonite was high or the ratio of tetrahedral substitution position was high, the hydration performance of montmorillonite was worse due to the low diffusibility of water molecules and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>.
