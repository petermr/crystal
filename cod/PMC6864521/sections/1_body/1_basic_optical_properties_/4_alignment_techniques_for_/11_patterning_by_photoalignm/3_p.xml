<p>To summarize the section on different alignment techniques, all of the above approaches, except for the photoalignment method, provide QR arrays with poor in‐plane control, limiting the highest reported DOP to 0.64 for CdSe/CdS dot‐in‐rod nanostructures.

 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> Theoretically, the maximum DOP that could be achieved for such QRs, which are uniformly aligned in‐plane with a high order parameter, is around 10:1. For LCD BLU applications, there are four approaches that are most suitable for device manufacturing, namely photoalignment, electrospinning, polymer stretching of composite films, and the electric field assisted assembly, whose major characteristics are compared in

 </xref>. The photoalignment, stretching and electric field assisted approaches show good order parameter, but only photoalignment provides perfect in‐plane alignment control. Electrospinning gives superior uniformity but the order parameter is limited to 0.6 only. Photoalignment shows high DOP, high order parameter and acceptable film uniformity.
