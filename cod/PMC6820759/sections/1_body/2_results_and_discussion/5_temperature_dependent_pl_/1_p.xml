 <sup>3+</sup>/0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor ranging from 303 K to 418 K have been measured at excitation wavelength of 365 nm shown on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(A)</xref>. With temperature increasing from room temperature 303 K to 423 K, it depicts that there is no change occurring in terms of the position and shape of the emission spectra while just the intensity of the emission spectrum decreases. When temperature turns up to 423 K the emission intensity decreases about 8%, compared with that at room temperature 303 K,, which indicates that the CLSO:0.20Dy
