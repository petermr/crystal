 <sup>2−</sup> near the LUMO can be achieved by increasing the band-gap. This suggests that band-gap engineering by mixing the constituent elements with others with the same valences can increase the band-gap, as in previous studies on In

 <italic>s</italic> is higher than that of In 
 <italic>s</italic>, resulting in an increase of the band-gap. In the present case, Fe 3
 <italic>d</italic> forms the bottom of the LUMO, significantly below the unoccupied 
 <italic>s</italic> levels of the other cations, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>. Therefore, partial substitutions of trivalent cations, which can shift up the location of the LUMO from the Fe 3
 <italic>d</italic> levels, for Fe may be effective to increase the band-gap.
