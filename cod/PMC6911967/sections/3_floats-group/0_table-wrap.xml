     <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (version 4.1) within the local density approximation to the exchange and correlation interactions between electrons [
     <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The valence states were expressed as linear combinations of the Sankey-Niklewski-type numerical atomic orbitals [
     <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The constant-current STM images were produced based on the Tersoff-Hamann approximation [
     <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] using the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Kohn-Sham equation [
     <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for a relaxed atomic structure. The WSxM software was used to process the calculated STM images [
