 <sup>2+</sup> and as-fabricated NIR pc-LED were comparatively measured by a fiber spectrophotometer (NOVA high sensitive spectrometer, idea optics, China), and the 375-nm and 450-nm laser diode acted as the excitation source. The temperature-dependent spectra were evaluated by a FLS920 spectrophotometer equipped with a MercuryiTc temperature control instrument (OXFORD). Liquid nitrogen was used to cool temperature. The decay time was measured by a FLS920 instrument equipped with 450 nm and 340 nm pulse laser diode. The statistical photons are 5000 and 10,000, respectively, for the measurements at low temperature (80 K) and room temperature (300 K), and the decay curvers were fitted by the FAST software attached with FLS920 spectrophotometer. All the photophysics properties measurements were repeated at least three times to confirm the data. The quantum efficiency was measured using a Hamamatsu absolute photoluminescence quantum yield spectrometer C11347 Quantaurus-QY. The photoelectric properties and emission spectra of the fabricated pc-LEDs were measured by a Morpho 3.2 software equipped with a NOVA Laboratory Class Spectrometer. Photographs for the application of NIR pc-LEDs are taken by a NIR and a visible camera.
