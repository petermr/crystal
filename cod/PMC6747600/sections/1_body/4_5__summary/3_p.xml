<p>The thermoelectric properties of CoSi are also interesting because it has a Seebeck coefficient that is large for semimetals, which cannot be described in constant relaxation-time approximation. In semimetals, the Seebeck coefficient is determined by the balance of electron and hole contributions. In CoSi, the density of states determines this balance both directly and indirectly through strong non-symmetric energy dependence of scattering rate, which is proportional to DOS.</p>
