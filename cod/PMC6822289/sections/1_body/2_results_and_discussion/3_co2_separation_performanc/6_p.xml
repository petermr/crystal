<p>A notable difference is found for COF 05000N2 (COF-1), which we found to be nonporous under the rigid framework assumption: the small uptake that was measured is possibly the consequence of the motion of the layers that creates interstices where the CO
 <sub>2</sub> molecule can percolate and occupy the pores. Considering the uptake in the low-pressure range, we note from the isotherms a systematic overestimation of the CO
 <sub>2</sub>â€“framework interactions, that reflects in higher Henry coefficients. Also, in the 3D COFs 07010N3 and 07011N3 the apparently higher saturation found in simulations may be related with the imperfect crystallinity of the sample or partial desolvation. A more detailed comparison is provided in the

Considering that we carry out a high-throughput approach, we conclude that the agreement with experiments is acceptable.
