 <caption> ( a) The calculated atomistic energies of the dissociated vacancy as a function of separation of the two jogs in MgO (blue filled diamond symbols - supercell without stress correction; red filled sphere symbols - supercell with stress correction; blue square symbols - the case of supercell without stress correction plus stress migration energies). The continuous line corresponds to a model with electrostatics (charged jogs) while the dotted-line corresponds to model results without electrostatic contributions (neutral jogs). ( b) Schematic of the dislocation model used to calculate the energetics of the dissociated vacancy as a function of jog-jog separation w. </caption>
