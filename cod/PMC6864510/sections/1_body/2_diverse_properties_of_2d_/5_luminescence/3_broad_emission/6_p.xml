<p>The self‐trapping reflects the bulk properties of the lattice, so the broad PL emission can be regulated by changing the crystal structure through synthesis with various organic amine cations that are typically small, highly symmetric, or flexible ditopic, based on the in‐depth understanding about the relationship between the self‐trapping states and the crystal structure of perovskites.</p>
