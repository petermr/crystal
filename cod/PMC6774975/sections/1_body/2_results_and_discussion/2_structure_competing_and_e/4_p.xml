<p>It is seen from

 <italic>a</italic>,
 <italic>b</italic> that the non-magnetic states of both L2
 <sub>1</sub>-type and XA-type structures have higher total energy than their ferromagnetic counterparts for both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi Heusler alloys, meaning that the ferromagnetic state is more energetically stable. Moreover, the total energy curves of ferromagnetic states would converge to the non-magnetic ones at small lattice constants and this is due to the abatement of magnetic moment with decreasing lattice, which will be discussed later. The antiferromagnetic state is not considered simply because the experimentally synthesized Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi compounds show ferromagnetic configuration with large magnetic moment [
