<p id="Par17">In this paper, we have demonstrated a new high-throughput approach enabling systematic and rapid study of the crystal-to-glass transformation of ternary alloys via solid-state reaction. The Ti–Ni–Cu crystal-to-glass transition map covering the entire ternary composition space was generated by high-throughput synchrotron XRD and XRF characterizations on a single combinatorial thin-film chip. The glass-forming composition agreed well with the literature. ToF-SIMS study showed that the Ti diffusion is the key factor for the crystal-to-glass transition, while the thickness of the Ti layer and the layer sequence of the component are also important in affecting the final product of the solid-state reaction.</p>
