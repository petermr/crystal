<p id="Par35">At 44.2(4) GPa, we collected 2963 reflections in total, which were merged based upon identical indices to 2014 independent reflections with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>int</sub> = 3.95%. At 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.8 Å, completeness of the data was 37.0%. The amount of the collected data allowed us to refine the thermal parameters of silicon atoms in an anisotropic approximation, while we could refine those of oxygen atoms in an isotropic approximation. The resulting ratio between data (2014) and the number of parameters (137) was ~15. Nineteen reflections were omitted from the refinement due to overlap with diamond. The final structure was refined to convergence with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 7.41%, 
 <italic>wR</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 13.99%, and GOF = 1.167 for all 2014 unique reflections [
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 5.55%, 
 <italic>wR</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 12.77%, for those 1562 data with 
 <italic>I</italic> &gt; 2σ(
 <italic>I</italic>)]. On a final difference Fourier map, we observed no peaks higher than 0.8 e·Å
 <sup>−2</sup>. The most of the intense peaks were within 1 Å of the Si atoms. Values of thermal parameters of all atoms are within the normal interval (0.006–0.01 A
 <sup>2</sup>).
