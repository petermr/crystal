<p>At the other nonpolar surface, ZnO(112[combining macron]0) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4bâ€“c</xref>), there is greater variety of the possible PT coordinates. For both surface-PT and adlayer-PT, the PHC can be transferred between surface atoms that lie within the same surface row (intra-surface-PT and intra-adlayer-PT), or between surface atoms that lie on different rows (inter-surface-PT and inter-adlayer-PT). The greatest PT rate is obtained for the inter-adlayer-PT coordinate, followed by intra-surface-PT, inter-surface-PT, and finally intra-adlayer-PT.
