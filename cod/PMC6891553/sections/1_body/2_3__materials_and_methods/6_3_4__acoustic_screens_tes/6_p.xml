<p>Two commercial diameters of aluminum cylinders, 16 and 12 mm, were used for the design of the thick and thin SCASs, respectively. The SCASs prototypes were built to perfectly fit the cross section of the tunnel. To take into account the 10 cm deep sand reservoir, the cylinders were assembled on a wooden base of 52 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm. In
