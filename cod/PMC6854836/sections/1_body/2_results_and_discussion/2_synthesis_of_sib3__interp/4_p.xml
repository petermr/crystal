<p>Reproducible results for the synthesis of SiB
 <sub>3</sub> from mixtures of elemental boron and silicon required tightly pressed and homogeneously dense pellets as well as precise control of the sample temperature. Therefore, we performed investigations into reaction temperatures and times in the well-controlled environment of a thermal analysis apparatus.
