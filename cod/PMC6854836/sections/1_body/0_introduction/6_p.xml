<p>Apart from its uncertain composition, also formation conditions and the thermal stability of SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> are poorly understood. It seems to be clear that above 1300 °C, SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> decomposes to orthorhombic SiB
 <sub>6</sub> and Si
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
 </sup> and recent phase diagrams specify 1270 °C as the peritectoid decomposition temperature.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>−
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
 </sup> However, the decomposition of SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> has also been reported at temperatures below 1250 °C,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
 </sup> whereas at the same time, significant rates of formation would require temperatures above 1250 °C.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
 </sup> Further, single crystals of SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> used in structural studies were obtained from Si-rich melts for which temperatures had to exceed 1400 °C.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> Aselage then put forward the interesting proposal that SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> is merely metastable, which could indeed explain the seemingly contradictory reports on synthesis conditions and thermal stability.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
 </sup> To this day, the thermodynamic properties of rhombohedral SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> have remained nebulous. Also, SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> lacks conclusive characterization of its physical properties.
