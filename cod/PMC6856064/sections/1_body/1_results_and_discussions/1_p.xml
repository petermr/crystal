 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d,e)</xref> show a newly designed PKG structure of width x length x thickness = 5.0 mm × 5.4 mm × 1.2 mm developed to incorporate three LEDs (one UV and two blue LEDs). The mounting area in which the chips were directly mounted was a circular structure with a diameter of 2 mm and a square structure at the center. The main component was an integrated heatsink that directly mounts the chip and absorbs the heat generated by the chip and distributes it to the heat sink.
