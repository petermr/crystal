<p>A growing dipole of the stacks simulated in MD is predicted using different methods. However, the scattering of the data is substantial, which is related to a large number of molecular geometries that are realized at room temperature in computer simulations. For example, the mean value of the dihedral angle is

 </inline-formula> = 32.1 ± 17.8° for dimers. The carbonyl groups point in the same direction most of the time but not always, since thermal motion affects the molecular conformations. The values of the macrodipoles (
