<p id="Par15">Liquid crystals doped with (10.00 ± 0.01) wt% CB15 have an initial pitch of ca. 1.5 μm, with initial values of 
 <italic>N</italic> ca. 20, and with such a confinement ratio the droplets start swimming helically as soon as they are injected in solution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). During movement, the number of spiral disclination lines decreases until eventually the droplet becomes a compensated nematic and motion also loses its chiral character (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, left panel). The number of spiral lines decreasing indicates that the pitch of the cholesteric helix increases over time, which we attribute to the empty micelles co-solubilizing CB15 together with the liquid crystal (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In contrast, for cholesteric droplets doped with (0.38 ± 0.01) wt% Me-
 <bold>m</bold> and having an initial pitch of 4.3 μm (
 <italic>N</italic> = 10), Me-
 <bold>m</bold> concentrates in the droplet during the motion and translates into an increase of spiral turns. This observation is consistent with previous report on chiral dopants structurally more complex than CB15, which have been proven to enrich in shrinking droplets
