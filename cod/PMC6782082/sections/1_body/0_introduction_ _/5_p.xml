<p>Even though layer groups were described for the first time about a century ago (Weber, 1929
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb37"> ▸</xref>; Alexander &amp; Hermann, 1929
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"> ▸</xref>), it was not until the paper by Zallen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (1971
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb39"> ▸</xref>) that they were applied for the first time for the description of phonon states in layered As
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub> and As
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub> crystals. Afterwards, they were also used for modelling atomically clean crystal surfaces (Ipatova &amp; Kitaev, 1985
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb18"> ▸</xref>). However, these studies did not involve the use of induced representations of layer groups. To the best of our knowledge, the first use of induced representations of layer groups was related to the study of the phonon symmetry of high-temperature superconductors (Evarestov 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb11"> ▸</xref>; Kitaev 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb19"> ▸</xref>) and thereafter to describe the phonon, electron, exciton and biexciton states in artificially grown nanolayers (semiconductor quantum wells) (Tronc &amp; Kitaev, 2001
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb35"> ▸</xref>) and layered crystals (Kitaev 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb20"> ▸</xref>). Quite recently, induced representations of layer groups have been applied in the analysis of the Brillouin-zone centre phonons in layered MoS
 <sub>2</sub> and WS
 <sub>2</sub> crystals (Evarestov 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"> ▸</xref>).
