<p>All samples were prepared in batches of 250 mg. Commercial Mg
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.5%) and Ca
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.5%) and Ta
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub> were used as reactants. Ta
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub> was prepared by ammonolysis of Ta
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.5%), through two repeated treatments at 850 °C for 15 h, under a NH
 <sub>3</sub> flow of 600 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/min, using 300 °C/h heating rate and natural cooling in the furnace. All the manipulations of the nitride reactants were carried out in a glovebox under an Ar atmosphere.
