<p class="p">As mentioned in Introduction, the intra- and internanoparticle interactions were proposed to play critical roles in the crystal growth (

 </xref>). Here, we found the weak interactions in the crystal. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>, the H⋅⋅⋅H interaction exists between the hydrogen atoms of two adjacent benzenes in the same staple, evidenced by their very close distance (2.545 and 2.837 Å, respectively; see fig. S10A) and the similar inward orientation of the two adjacent benzenes. In addition to the H⋅⋅⋅H interaction, the C-H⋅⋅⋅π intraparticle interaction also exists, and the H⋅⋅⋅π distance is short (average, 2.80 Å; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref> and fig. S10B) (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). These interactions lead to the reverse spiral arrangements of the two sets of benzene rings in the staple ring (inside and outside, five benzenes for each set), shown in fig. S10C, which was not previously reported. As a consequence, these interactions enable every single nanoparticle to be compacted and ordered with reduced intraparticle vibration, contributing to the formation of high-quality single crystals.
