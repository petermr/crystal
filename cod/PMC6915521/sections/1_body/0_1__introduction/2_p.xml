<p>Generally, the profile of a contact surface is a random one, and the random profile is always simplified as ideal cylinder or sphere asperities. In a nanoscale sliding contact, the asperities on the surface can help to reduce contact area and surface-to-volume ratio, which will reduce friction force further. In addition, the artificial nanoscale textured surfaces have proved that they could greatly reduce adhesion and friction of many materials [
