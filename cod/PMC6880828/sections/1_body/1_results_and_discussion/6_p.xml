<p>Finally, the photochemical and thermal isomerization behavior of the complexes was studied. Initially, the behavior of ligand 
 <bold>1</bold> was studied by UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy, showing similar behavior as related first generation molecular motors (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref> for full details). Irradiation with 312 nm light at −70 °C isomerizes stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> to unstable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>, which undergoes a thermal helix inversion (THI) when warmed to room temperature to form stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>. The second half of the rotation cycle is similar, as irradiation with 312 nm light isomerizes stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> to unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>, which undergoes THI to form stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> when left for several days at room temperature.
