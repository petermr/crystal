<p>Similarly, a decrease in the average oxidation state (AOS) (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicates the presence of manganese in the 4+ and 3+ oxidation states. The percentage of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> in these materials was 16%, and 36% for Mn4 and Mn8, respectively. The results of the AOS, for Mn4 and Mn8, are close to those reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for birnessite produced by solid-state reactions at 400 and 800 °C. Thermal analysis in nitrogen and air atmospheres (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f001">Figure 1</xref>) showed thermal events typical of these layer materials [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Weight loss, up to 250 °C, is attributed to the evaporation of physiosorbed water and interlayer water. From 250 to about 800 °C, the materials lose oxygen because of the phase transformation from a layer to a tunnel structure [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. When heated to temperatures above 250 °C, the Mn4 material loses 2.48% of its original mass in nitrogen atmosphere. Similarly, Mn8 experienced a weight loss of 1.69%. These results indicate that the materials synthesized at higher temperatures lose less oxygen, and show a greater thermal stability, compared to the ones synthesized by chemical routes [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The materials were more stable in nitrogen than in air, as it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The difference in weight losses at temperatures higher than 250 °C between both atmospheres indicates a release of oxygen from the framework, as it was reported by Suib et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For Mn4, this difference was 0.53%, and it was 0.16% for Mn8. The combined results of atomic absorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and AOS were used to formulate the structural formula shown in
