<p>Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> has been known since the 1950s [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. At that time, magnesium alanate was synthesized in an organic solvent by the reaction between magnesium hydride and aluminum tri-halides, Equation (6). After almost 50 years, the solid state version of reaction (6) was reported on by Dymova et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and others [
 <xref rid="B194-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Additionally, roughly at the same time, the metathesis reaction between NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> in organic solvent was reported [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the synthesis that involves organic solvents, the formation of adducts, and the purification (drying without decomposing the alanates), is a frequent problem. Thus, more recently, the metathesis reaction between NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> (or LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>) and MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, as assisted by mechanical milling, was published and frequently used [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B195-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>].
