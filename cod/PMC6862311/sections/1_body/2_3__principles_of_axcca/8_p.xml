<p>To illustrate the type of problems which can be addressed by AXCCA, let us consider X-ray scattering from an ensemble of identical particles randomly oriented in space. First of all, one can recover the structure of an individual particle by analyzing the diffraction patterns from the ensemble of particles with a uniform distribution of orientations [

 <xref rid="B57-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This problem becomes significantly simplified if one can neglect the interference between the diffracted X-rays from different particles, which is possible if the transverse coherence length of X-rays is smaller than the typical interparticle distance [
 <xref rid="B51-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This corresponds to the case of a “dilute solution” in conventional scattering theory for liquids or small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), when the structure factor simply equals to unity.
