<p id="Par11">As the PL emission from the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) perovskite film at room temperature has only one peak from the 3D phase, there should be efficient energy transfer from layered perovskites to 3D perovskite. To verify it, we performed transient absorption measurement to study the charge-carrier dynamics in PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, the bleach peak around 485 nm belongs to the 3D phase in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) film. The bleach peak evolved in the first 2 ps after light excitation, suggesting a fast energy transfer from layered perovskites to 3D phase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). After 2 ps, the energy funneling is complete, followed by charge recombination in 3D perovskite. The energy transfer from layered phases to 3D phase functions as an energy and carrier concentrator to enhance radiative recombination efficiency for higher PLQE, which has been reported in red-emission 2D–3D mixed perovskite films

 </sup>. The promoted radiative recombination should give rise to higher PLQE observed in the PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) perovskite films.
