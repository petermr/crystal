  <italic>GIDVis</italic> is a software package based on MATLAB specialized for, but not limited to, the visualization and analysis of grazing-incidence thin-film X-ray diffraction data obtained during sample rotation around the surface normal. 
  <italic>GIDVis</italic> allows the user to perform detector calibration, data stitching, intensity corrections, standard data evaluation (
  <italic>e.g.</italic> cuts and integrations along specific reciprocal-space directions), crystal phase analysis 
  <italic>etc</italic>. To take full advantage of the measured data in the case of sample rotation, pole figures can easily be calculated from the experimental data for any value of the scattering angle covered. As an example, 
  <italic>GIDVis</italic> is applied to phase analysis and the evaluation of the epitaxial alignment of pentaceneÂ­quinone crystallites on a single-crystalline Au(111) surface.
