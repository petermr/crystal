 <caption> a) Schematic illustration of the band structure of CdSe QDs of two different sizes. b) Energy bandgap dependence on the radius of CdSe QDs, here dots are the experimental data and the solid line is the calculated data using Equation (1). The inset shows photograph of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs of different sizes (synthesized at University of Hamburg in 2001) emitting all over the visible spectral range.
