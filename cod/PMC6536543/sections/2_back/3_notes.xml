 <p>D.S.P. proposed the research and did the project planning. D.S.P., J.R.F., T.M., D.Z., V.G.C., S.M. and C.P. performed the X-ray diffraction measurements in three different synchrotron beamtimes at PETRA III and ALBA-CELLS. Diffraction data were later analyzed by D.S.P., J.R.F. and R. Ch.J. The Raman spectroscopy measurements and analysis were carried out by D.S.P., M.P.A. and E.G. The 
  <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations were done by P. R.H. and A.M. The writing of the manuscript was done by D.S.P. and all the authors contributed to revising it.
