 <p>Recently, we synthesized a one-dimensional (1D) structure of V
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub>. The 1D V
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub> resembles another 1D material, Nb
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub>, which is expected to have a direct band gap. To determine the potential applications of this material, we calculated the band structures of 1D and bulk V
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub> using density functional theory by varying the number of chains and comparing their band structures and electronic properties with those of Nb
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub>. The results showed that a small number of V
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub> chains have a direct band gap, whereas bulk V
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub> possesses an indirect band gap, like Nb
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub>. We expect that V
  <sub>2</sub>Se
  <sub>9</sub> nanowires with diameters less than ∼20 Å would have direct band gaps. This indirect-to-direct band gap transition could lead to potential optoelectronic applications for this 1D material because materials with direct band gaps can absorb photons without being disturbed by phonons.
