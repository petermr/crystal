<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, the final relaxed structure using the AE–LCAO method and the HSE functional is displayed. The bond distances and atom heights for the key atoms in the top layer calculated with different exchange-correlation functionals are compared in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All the functionals consistently predict the O
 <sub>2
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> atom bonded to H that moves outwards by 0.13 Å. The height of the H atom above the O
 <sub>2
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> plane is directly observable in non–contact atomic force microscopy (NCAFM) images (Stetsovych et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) resulting in a value of 0.11 Å, which is in good agreement with the one predicted here.
