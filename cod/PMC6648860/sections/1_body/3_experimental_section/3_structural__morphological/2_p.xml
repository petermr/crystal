<p>X-ray powder diffraction data were acquired using borosilicate glass capillaries of 0.3 or 0.5 mm diameter as sample holders. Laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 diffractometer in a Debye Scherrer configuration equipped with Mo Kα
 <sub>1</sub> radiation source (λ = 0.7093 Å) and Johansson monochromator. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD) patterns were collected at the MSPD beamline
