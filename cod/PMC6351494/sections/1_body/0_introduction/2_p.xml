<p>Our group has been working on intermetallic anodes such as Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Sn, because the intermetallic anodes are compatible with a conventional electrolyte solution: magnesium bis(trifluoromethansulfonylamide) (Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> ) dissolved in acetonitrile(AN) (Arthur et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Despite the high equilibrium potential and the low specific capacity of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>, the compatibility against wide variety of the electrolyte solutions could become an advantage for the development of a battery system. Moreover, since the bismuth is very heavy element, the volumetric capacity of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>: 1906 mAh cm
 <sup>−3</sup> is still comparable value to the theoretical capacity of lithium metal. Therefore, we think the “Mg-ion” battery using the intermetallic anode could be a more realistic direction to develop a practical battery system.
