<p>Finally, optimizing &gt;300 structures also gives important insights in the state of the art of COF synthesis and in the applicability of the different programs that were used in our workchain. To show an example usage of the structure we obtained, with refined geometry and partial charges, we screened the COFs in our database for their potential application in capturing carbon dioxide from coalâ€™s postcombustion gases.</p>
