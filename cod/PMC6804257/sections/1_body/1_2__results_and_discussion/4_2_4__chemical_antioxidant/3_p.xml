<p>The DPPH assay is not suitable for binuclear Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> complexes due to the formation of a colored complex, and, for the binuclear Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complexes, the reduced activity against this radical was not enough to calculate IC
 <sub>50</sub>. By contrast, IC
 <sub>50</sub> of FeL14 against DPPD was nearly identical with the value against ABTS. The mononuclear complex of the reduced size was expected to reach the radical site of DPPH closely enough as to enhance the activity in comparison to the binuclear ones. This possible effect was found only for the FeL14 among the tested L14 complexes. Since the DFT-generated structures involved almost the same bond lengths and angles independently of the nature of the central metals, the significant activity shown only by the Fe complex is ascribable to the electronic density of the metal center rather than a conformational arrangement of chelate molecules.
