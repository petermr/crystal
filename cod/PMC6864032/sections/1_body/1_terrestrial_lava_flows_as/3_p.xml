 </sup> concluded that the lithologic diversity observed in Theo’s Flow was the result of a differentiation process of a single, thick magma pulse, rather than being generated by the eruption of multiple magmatic batches with distinct composition. This conclusion was based on the absence of sharp boundaries between adjacent units and on the progressive compositional changes observed in mineral and bulk-rock compositions. According to these authors

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>, even if this hypothesis was further supported by the matching between the average composition of the whole magmatic pile with that of the quenched hyaloclastite breccia at the top, the latter being considered as having the composition of the primary magma, “the exact nature of the differentiation process remains uncertain”. Therefore, the origin of Theo’s Flow and its cooling history have been extensively debated
