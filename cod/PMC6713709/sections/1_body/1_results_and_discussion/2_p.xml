<p id="Par6">As the working electrode, an Au mesh with a carbon micro-grid was used for electrochemical measurements and photoelectron mapping. An Al sheet was welded to the edge of the Au mesh to establish an electrical connection to one of the five terminals of the cell holder as the cathode current collector. An LCO slurry was dropped onto the micro-grid and the dried slurry was sandwiched with a solid electrolyte. We used dilute slurry, i.e. small amount of LCO particles, for the clear observation of each isolated single crystalline particle on the microgrid. Before installation to the high vacuum chamber, a high magnification optical image was obtained to identify the X-Y coordinates of the selected single crystalline LCO particles. A Cu current anode collector, metal Li as anode material, PEO/LiTFSI solid (dry polymer) electrolyte, Li

 <sub>12</sub> (LLZ) ceramics electrolyte, PEO/LiTFSI dry polymer electrolyte, and the Au mesh with LCO were all fixed by ceramics jigs. The adhesive property of PEO/LiTFSI dry polymer created a good interface between the dry polymer and the metal Li, LLZ, and LCO to decrease the interfacial resistance. The carbon micro-grid played the role of a conduction path from the Au mesh to the single crystalline LCO particles.
