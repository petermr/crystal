<p id="Par10">Post-tilleyite also contains two types of disilicate groups due to symmetry reduction, which causes that the Wyckoff positions 4e in the tilleyite

 <sub>1</sub>
 <italic>/n</italic> structure split into two symmetrically independent 2a positions. The dihedral angle of the [Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>] units change at the transition from 154.3° at 7.9 GPa to 149.4° and 156.7° at 10.8 GPa. These topological transformations entail considerable changes in the coordination number of Ca atoms. For instance, at 10.8 GPa, analyses of Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra reveal that Ca–O distances between 2.16 and 2.88 Å make up the Ca first-coordination spheres in post-tilleyite, defining variable Ca coordination polyhedra in different sites. The Ca coordination number varies from 6 to 9 (1 × [CaO
 <sub>6</sub>], 3 × [CaO
 <sub>7</sub>], 5 × [CaO
 <sub>8</sub>], 1 × [CaO
 <sub>9</sub>]). The existence of such a range of different polyhedral volumes within the same structure is very unusual and interesting from the geophysical point of view. Such a structure could likely host divalent cations with different radii without inducing significant elastic strains. This is particularly relevant within the complex scenario of Earth’s mantle, where natural compositions likely include Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, and other cations coexisting with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. Thus, post-tilleyite offers a versatile structural possibility in comparison with aragonite, the most stable structure for Ca-rich carbonates in the upper and intermediate mantle, which has large polyhedral voids to host small cations (Ca atoms in nine-fold coordination)
