 <caption> The variation of PL energy with lattice vector for different compositions of Zn 2+, fitted with an error bar which is approximated using the Gaussian model fitting. ( a) PL energy variation of CsZn xPb 1-xCl 3 NCs. ( b) PL energy variation of CsZn xPb 1-xBr 3 NCs. The different points correspond to 0%, 3%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of Zn 2+, respectively. The highest energy point corresponds to the highest content of Zn 2+ and the lowest energy point corresponds to the lowest content of Zn 2+. </caption>
