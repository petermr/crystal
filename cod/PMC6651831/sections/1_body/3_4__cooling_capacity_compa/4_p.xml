<p>When the cooling performance of the transverse thermoelectric was compared under the same component combination but with different inclusion types, it was found that for the composite with the same component volume fraction, the fibrous and layered composites yielded very similar ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> as well as Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T values. However, it should be noted that the peak performances of the layered and fibrous composites under the same volume fraction were not identical to each other. The ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values were rounded up to the nearest integer, and the maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T values were rounded up to the second decimal in

 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> values in between different configurations have same values, it should be noted that none of the results in
