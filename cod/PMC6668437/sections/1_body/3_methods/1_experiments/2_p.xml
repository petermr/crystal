<p id="Par26">ARPES measurements were performed at the I05 beamline of Diamond Light Source, UK. Single crystal samples were cleaved in situ at a pressure lower than 2 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> mbar and measured at temperatures about 7 K. Measurements were performed using (s,p)-polarized synchrotron light from 18 to 100 eV and employing Scienta R4000 hemispherical electron energy analyzer with an angular resolution of 0.2–0.5° and an energy resolution of 3–20 meV
