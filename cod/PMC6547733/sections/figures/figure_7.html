 <caption> Effect of electronic excitation and induced structural deformations on the projected density of states of monoclinic LTO at 300 K. Comparison between the projected density of states ( a) without (solid lines) and with (dashed lines) 0.8% electronic excitation and no structural relaxation. ( b) Comparison between the projected density of states at 0.8% electronic excitation, without structural relaxation (solid lines) and with excitation induced structural deformations (dashed lines) as shown in Fig.  9(b) for t = 10.5 ps. The Fermi energy is referenced by a black dashed line at 0 eV. </caption>
