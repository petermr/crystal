<p>Another advantage of the 3rd generation X-ray synchrotron beams with high coherence is the ability to focus them to hundred nanometer sizes and below [

 <xref rid="B48-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. With such small focus sizes only a limited number of particles may be illuminated by a single X-ray spot. This will naturally lead to fluctuations of intensity when the X-ray spot will be moved from one part of the sample to another. In this case a raster scan of the sample with a focused X-ray beam may be performed to obtain structural information on ensemble average orientational order over a large area of the sample.
