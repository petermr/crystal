<p>In summary, a high-gravity precipitation method for the synthesis of nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was developed in this work. Through the exploration of the synthesis process, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> with anatase crystals, smaller particle sizes, better dispersion and average particle sizes of 12.5 nm was obtained in IS-RPB. When the calcination temperature was 500 Â°C, nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> had a better anatase crystal and maintained a smaller particle size. At the same time, Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was synthesized in situ for the degradation of toluene as a VOC. The results show that the Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> anatase phase remains intact, and the variation of the Raman peak width and intensity shows evidence of the existence of iron. XPS and EDX mapping shows that iron was uniformly distributed in TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and exists in the positive trivalent form. When the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> was increased from 0.5% to 5.0%, the band gap energy of the catalyst was reduced from 3.06 eV in undoped Fe to 2.86 eV and 2.26 eV. Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> not only broadens the photoresponse range but also effectively suppresses the recombination of the electron and hole. As a result, the catalytic activity was enhanced. The degradation rate of 1.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> to toluene of 105 ppm reached 95.7% after 4 h under UV light.
