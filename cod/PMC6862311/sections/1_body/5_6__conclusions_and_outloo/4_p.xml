<p>An intriguing option is to combine AXCCA with ultra-short X-ray pulses from XFEL sources. This allows one not only to study the static structure of the system, but also to investigate dynamical processes. In order to measure the coherent diffraction from a dynamical system, the X-ray pulse duration should be shorter than the characteristic time scale in the system; otherwise the speckles on the diffraction pattern would smear out due to the movement of the particles. This also means that the incoming photon flux should be high enough to produce sufficient diffraction signal from a single shot. The usage of short X-ray pulses together with AXCCA potentially opens the opportunity to study the structure of molecular clusters which are instantaneously formed in liquids, for example, in water [

We foresee that it is only a matter of time before AXCCA is combined with the techniques studying dynamics of the systems such as X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS).
