<p id="Par22">We have also performed semi-infinite-slab calculations to model the spectral function seen in the surface-sensitive experiment. We show the results for the energy-momentum intensity distribution in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref> and momentum distribution for different energies in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g–i</xref>. The maps at different energies are intended to illustrate the qualitative constancy of the picture upon increasing the size of the lens. The surface character of the well-defined arc and corresponding dispersion is clearly notable: narrow red features on the blue background of the

Nevertheless, the presented results of the FPLO calculations directly support our ARPES data and thus the observation of the type II Weyl state in YbMnBi
