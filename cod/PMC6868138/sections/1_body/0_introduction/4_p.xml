<p id="Par6">Our general strategy is inspired by the chirality-derived reorientation mechanisms of living systems, where molecular machines drive a change in chiral structures to initiate a reorientation from the molecular level upwards. We have incorporated molecular motors in an (achiral) nematic liquid crystal. The chirality of the motors induces a twist in the liquid crystal and leads to the formation of a light-responsive cholesteric liquid crystal, which is characterized by a helical organization of the molecules (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This liquid crystal was confined into a spherical droplet with perpendicular anchoring—the interface is such that the liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicularly to the interface. In these conditions of anchoring, a double spiral disclination line forms at the interface, which reflects the handedness of the cholesteric helix and is associated with a spiral distribution of the director field in the bulk of the droplet
