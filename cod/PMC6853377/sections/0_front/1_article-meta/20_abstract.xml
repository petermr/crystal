<abstract abstract-type="toc">
 <p>A highly effective way to cope with the weak signals in hard X-ray angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy is introduced. Full-field momentum imaging combined with time-of-flight parallel energy recording constitute a 3D recording scheme, gaining two orders of magnitude in detection efficiency.</p>
