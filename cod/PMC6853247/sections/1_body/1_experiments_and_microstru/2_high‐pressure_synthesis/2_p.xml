<p>Large single crystals of San Carlos olivine with no visible inclusions were handpicked and crushed to make a fine‐grained powder by cold pressing in a hydraulic press. The powder was then sorted to obtain ~5‐ to 10‐μm grains by suspension method. The powder was then cold pressed in a hydraulic press and then vacuum sintered in a furnace oven at 1200 °C for 12 hr to obtain a dense polycrystalline aggregate of San Carlos olivine. The dense olivine aggregate was then core drilled to obtain a cylindrical sample of 1.8‐mm length and 1.8‐mm diameter.</p>
