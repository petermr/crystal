<p>The chemical bonds of the eleven crystals studied included N–N, H–C, H–N, H–O, C–C, C–N, C–O, N–O and O–O bonds. For all types of chemical bonds in each crystal, we counted their number as a function of time during the shock process. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the covalent bonds’ breaking and recombination of shocked material was a dynamical process. For example, the trigger bonds N–NO
 <sub>2</sub> in CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O started to break at 124.8 fs, but they recombined to the initial state at 189.3 fs. We thereby defined the initiation of the chemical reaction by the time 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic>, from when the breaking of the chemical bonds was always more than their recombination and the number of the trigger bonds decreased continuously. Therefore, the decomposition reaction began at 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> = 103.6 fs for BTF and at 204.3 fs for CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O.
