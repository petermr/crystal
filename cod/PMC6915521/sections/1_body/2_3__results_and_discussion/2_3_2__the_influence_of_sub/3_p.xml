<p>The average friction forces for different depths of ball defects are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f017">Figure 17</xref>. For cases of perfect substrate, or where the defects are closer to the surface of the substrate, the average friction forces are increased with the increase in the depth of the defects. In this work, when 
 <italic>h</italic> = 3.615 nm, the average friction force is the highest. When the depth is greater than 3.615 nm, the average friction forces decrease with the increase in depth, and the average friction forces gradually approach that of the perfect substrate, which means that the effects of subsurface defects on friction become slight when the depth reaches a certain value.
