 </sup>. SALON crystallizes in a hitherto unknown structure type in the tetragonal space group 
 <italic>P</italic>4
 <sub>2</sub>/
 <italic>m</italic> (no. 84) with the unit-cell parameters 
 <italic>a</italic> equals 7.959(2) Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> equals 3.184(1) Å. The structure is an ordered variant of the UCr
 <sub>4</sub>C
 <sub>4</sub>-structure type with Sr on the corresponding uranium site, an ordering of aluminium and lithium on the corresponding chromium site and an ordering of nitrogen and oxygen on the corresponding carbide site. Based on the data quality and the different scattering factors, the location and occupation of the Sr, Li and Al sites could be unambiguously determined. Two kinds of tetrahedra form a highly condensed network hosting the strontium cations in one of the resulting channels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In the first type of tetrahedra (T1, grey tetrahedra), aluminium is coordinated by three nitrogen and one oxygen atom forming a [AlON
 <sub>3</sub>]
 <sup>8-</sup> unit. In the second type (T2, orange tetrahedra), lithium is coordinated by one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms forming a [LiO
 <sub>3</sub>N]
 <sup>8-</sup> unit. Each oxygen or nitrogen atom acts as a fourfold bridging atom leading to a sphalerite-like degree of condensation 
 <italic>κ</italic>, which is equivalent to the atomic ratio of (Li,Al)/(O,N) equals 1. This is unusual for anionic 3D tetrahedra networks (an illustration of this network can be found in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).
