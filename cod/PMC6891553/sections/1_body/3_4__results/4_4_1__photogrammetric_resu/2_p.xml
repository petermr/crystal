<p>To quantitatively estimate the amount of sand moved in this comparison, we considered three longitudinal sections of the scaled wind tunnel (called sections 0.00, 0.26, and 0.52), as can be seen on the left side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f007">Figure 7</xref>a. Only three longitudinal profiles were taken into account for this calculation since the displacement of the sand is regular, without large level differences in the wind tunnel cross-sections (in the direction of the ABs), due to the use of the air diffuser.
