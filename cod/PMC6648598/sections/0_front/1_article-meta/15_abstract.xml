  </sub> (
  <italic>x</italic> = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.20) samples were obtained in a single-phase form, and the crystal structure depended on the Ta content; they were monoclinic α-phase (

  <italic>x</italic> = 0.03, 0.04), and cubic δ-phase (

  <sub>2</sub>O

  <italic>a</italic>*) was comparable to that of commercial orange pigments, and the yellowness value (
  <italic>b</italic>*) was slightly larger. Although it is necessary to improve chemical stability, the (Bi
