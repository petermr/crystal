 </sup> The presence of the E

 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> mode in the TSL NW is a clear indication that the overall symmetry of a TSL is hexagonal. Indeed, its corresponding space group is

 <italic>mc</italic> (#186), which is the same as the WZ structure. Notably, the Raman spectrum of the TSL also consists of several phonon modes on the higher wavenumber side of the TO mode, which are neither observed in the ZB nor in the WZ phase but arise from the backfolding of the phonon dispersion due to the different lattice parameter introduced by the superlattice.
