 <sub>z</sub>-dispersion and very small gaps caused by anisotropic Weyl cones implied by the calculations, we have performed both very detailed photon energy dependent measurements and high-resolution measurements near the calculated Weyl points (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It turned out that the mentioned earlier photon energies at which the FS contours were sharp and continuous approximately correspond to
