<p>In cases where the specimen contains one or more features, one can usually observe their trace as moving objects in a sequence of detector hit maps calculated for a finite number of ions, e.g. typically .5 to 1 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> ions. This is demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g004">Fig 4</xref>) where the position of the GB line migrates across the detector hit map at different stages of the experiment, corresponding to different depths in the resultant reconstruction. To reconstruct a specific line feature automatically in 3D, an iterative procedure which reads through successive sections of the dataset is required.
