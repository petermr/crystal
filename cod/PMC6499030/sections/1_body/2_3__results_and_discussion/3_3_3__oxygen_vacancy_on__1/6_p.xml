<p>The localized states associated with the Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> ions provide a rigorous test of the flexibility of the local Gaussian basis sets used. The nature of the localized d-state is very different to that of the delocalized d-band of the undoped system. We therefore expect some sensitivity to the flexibility of the basis set used to describe the Ti-d derived orbitals. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> the DOS in the band gap is displayed for both the oxygen subsurface vacancy with the two basis sets, BS2 and BS3. Although the calculations using BS2 reproduce the surface structure very accurately, the computed position of the defects state relative to the CBM differs by 6% to that predicted by the more flexible BS3. The computational time increases by 33% by using BS3 instead of BS2.
