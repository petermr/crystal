<p id="Par15">Previous reports have shown that 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> displays a high susceptibility towards electron doping on the plane surface by electrostatic gating, suggesting that it can accommodate excess electron density at the Fermi level

 </sup>. It has been suggested that partially filled 
 <italic>d</italic>-bands associated with the metallic character of 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> allow for this additional electron density to be accepted during electrochemical reduction processes, giving rise to the HER activity of the metallic 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> phase. Using this approach, the poor electrocatalytic activity displayed by the semiconducting 2H-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> polymorph can be explained by its inability to accept excess electron density

 </sup>. Prior work by Seok et al., built on this framework to propose that the catalytic activity of 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> arises from electron doping on the metallic surface, which in turn drives Peierls-type lattice distortion

 <sub>H</sub> and hence an active HER catalyst.
