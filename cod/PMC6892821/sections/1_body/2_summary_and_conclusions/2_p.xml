<p id="Par16">In conclusion, our combined theoretical and experimental study shows that correlations between 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> results and measurements of core binding energies can be drawn in order to characterise multi-alkali antimonide photocathodes. We emphasise that this connection is particularly relevant given the limited freedom for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>in operando</italic> characterization of photocathode materials for accelerator applications. The possibility to grow purely stoichiometric photocathodes is achievable only using X-ray beamlines equipped with suitable and yet non-transferable setups

 </sup>, which enhances the role of 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> theory in the whole optimization process. While at the present status, we have explored from first principles only ideal stoichiometric bulk materials, further studies are requested to bridge the gap with experiments. Additional calculations addressing non-stoichiometric compounds are expected to be significantly more demanding from a computational perspective but more relevant to finally bridge the gap to experiments. Novel techniques such as high-throughput screening and machine learning are expected to provide an important aid towards the achievement of this goal. In this perspective, the results of this work represent the first step towards establishing a robust connection between experimental preparation and characterisation of photocathodes, 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> prediction of their electronic structure, and modeling of the emission and beam formation processes in operational conditions.
