<p>For each sample, chemical composition and crystal structure were determined by means of XRD measurements in a PANalytical X’Pert PRO MPD θ/θ Bragg–Brentano powder diffractometer with a radius of 240 mm using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Particle size measurement by LD was done using an LS 13 320MW from a Beckman Coulter device. To corroborate particle sizes, shape, and agglomeration, SEM images were obtained with a Field Emission SEM JEDL J-7100. Finally, magnetic properties were measured in a magnetometer SQUID Quantum Design MPMS XL.</p>
