 </sup>, which defines that the electronic charge belongs to the particular atom, if it is encountered inside the so-called Bader volumes enclosed by the zero-flux surfaces perpendicular to the minima of the charge density. The so-obtained Bader charge is considered as a good approximation for the total all-electron charge of the corresponding atom.
