<p>There are increasing attempts focusing on Sn-based anode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries due to their high storage capacities [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], among which the intermetallic Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn seems to be the representative one [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn has received attention due to its ultra-high mechanical damping property in the wide frequency range of 1–200 Hz as well as 20–100 KHz [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is promising for energy dissipation applications such as vibration-resistant components and noise-cancelling products. The damping capacity Q
 <sup>−1</sup> of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of commercial damping alloys including grey cast iron, Fe–Mn, Ni–Ti, Sn–Pb alloys, etc. [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The results of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn with a frequency of 1 Hz measured under heating reveal the interesting points: an obvious damping peak exists at about 310 K which just corresponds to the turning point of storage modulus; when the temperature is lower than 310 K, the damping capacity increases continuously [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Though the basic damping mechanism of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn remains unknown presently, these experimental data suggest the appearance of a phase transformation in Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn at near-room temperature (~310 K).
