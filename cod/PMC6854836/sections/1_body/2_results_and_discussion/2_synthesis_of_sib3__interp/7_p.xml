<p>We summarize the results from the nano-Si/amorphous boron reactions as follows: α-SiB
 <sub>3–

 <sub>6</sub> was observed, which is in agreement with earlier reports.

 </sub> formation, whereas the usage of crystalline boron seemed to increase rates. This perhaps unexpected finding may relate to the sluggish onset of reactions with nano-Si/amorphous mixtures at 1150 and 1175 °C, during which amorphous boron partially crystallized before SiB
