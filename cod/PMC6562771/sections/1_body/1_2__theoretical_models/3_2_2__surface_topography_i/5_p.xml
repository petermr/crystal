<p>On the mono-frequency vibration condition, regular turning marks in relation to the vibration will be observed on the machined surface. Kim et al. pointed out that the number of the bulge segments is identical to the integer part of the frequency ratio in Equation (6), i.e., the predictions results as demonstrated in

 <italic>ε</italic> is positive the orientation is counter clockwise, and clockwise vice versa as depicted in

Tauhiduzzaman et al. experimentally investigated the vibration induced by the imbalance of the spindle, and reported that this kind of vibration is synchronous, which can result in the called ‘spindle star’ that appears as straight concentric spokes as demonstrated in
