<p>Three nanocrystalline NiAl models were established by Atomsk software [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] using a Voronoi construction [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the three model geometries for MD simulations. The blue part is the Body Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal of NiAl, and the gray part is the grain boundary structure. Nanocrystalline NiAl models contained 10, 30 and 50 grains in a body-centered cubic of random orientation, and their grain sizes were 6.5, 4.5, 3.8 nm, respectively. There are 234,467, 234,471 and 234,300 atoms in each model, respectively. All the three models demonstrated the same dimensions (14.1 nm × 14.1 nm × 14.1 nm).
