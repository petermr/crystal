The effective QTAIM charge of +1.6 for Mg is in good agreement with the large electronegativity difference between Mg and Si. The corresponding charges in other intermetallic compounds of magnesium amount to values between +1.28 and +1.59;

 <xref rid="anie201907432-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> The shapes of the silicon species are more polyhedral‐like, and the flat contact faces between neighboring atoms are typical for non‐polar covalent bonding. The silicon QTAIM atoms have charges between 0.0 and −0.6, revealing an unequal charge transfer from the magnesium to the silicon atoms.
