 <caption> ( a) The comparison of the Poisson’s ratio the [ 110 ] - and [ 101 ] -directions, which are equivalent in cubic systems ( σ ′ / σ = 1 ), plotted as a function of σ ′ / σ ratio. ( b) The dependence of Poisson’s ratio in the [ 101 ] [ 1 ¯ 01 ] -direction on the external pressure conditions. The lines are drawn to guide the eye. </caption>
