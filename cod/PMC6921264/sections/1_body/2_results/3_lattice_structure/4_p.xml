<p>Because of less charge in the molecule, the cell difference between the simulation and experiment should be attributed to the description about the intermolecular interaction. 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref> shows four main dimer structures with the great intermolecular interaction. 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a,b is typical π–π stacking dimers, called π–π1 and π–π2, respectively. In addition, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>c,d shows doublet HB systems, marked with HB1 and HB2. Three structural parameters are applied to compare the simulated and experimental π–π stacking dimers:
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 </sup> the distance between the two geometry centers of the six-member rings (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>gc</sub>), the distance between the two π-planes constructed by the six-member rings (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>pl</sub>), and the angle between the normal vector of a plane and the vector from the center to the other (Anc). Overall, few differences can be found on Anc, while both distances are shortened slightly. In π–π1, the experimental 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>gc</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>pl</sub> are 4.113 and 3.212 Å, while the simulated ones are 3.960 and 3.096 Å. The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>gc</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>pl</sub> were decreased by 0.153 and 0.116 Å, respectively. For π–π2 in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b, the differences on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>gc</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>pl</sub> were less with 0.102 and 0.052 Å. Compared with the structures with π–π stacking, the HB dimers have slightly larger structural charges as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>c,d. Here, the length (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>HB</sub>) and angle (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>HB</sub>) of the HB were applied to describe the HB dimer. The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>HB</sub> between H18(A) and O8(B) is shorten by 0.141 Å and that between O13(A) and H19(B) is decreased by 0.201 Å. However, the 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>HB</sub> of N14–H19–O13 and N14–H18–O8 varied little. Thus, one can conclude that shorter equilibrium distances between molecules should contribute to the smaller lattice crystal.
