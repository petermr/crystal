<p>Compared to the raster-scanning radar system, the mixed-scanning radar system substitutes one-dimensional (1-D) raster scanning with 1-D mechanical scanning or 1-D electrical scanning, and the imaging speed can be greatly improved. In 2012, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, Beijing, China) proposed a 0.22 THz radar system based on the combination of fan-beam scanning and aperture synthesized reconstruction techniques [

 <xref rid="B14-sensors-19-02330" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The high resolution in the horizontal and vertical direction is achieved by the narrow side of the fan-beam through raster scanning and synthetic aperture through mechanical scanning, respectively. The imaging resolution is about 7 mm in the horizontal direction and better than 4 mm in the vertical direction, and the image reconstruction time is less than 3 s. In 2018, China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP, Mianyang, Sichuan) and National University of Defense Technology (NUDT, Changsha, Hunan) presented a 0.34 THz radar system [

 <xref rid="B16-sensors-19-02330" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This system incorporates a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array as an electronic beam former in the horizontal dimension and an elliptic cylinder as a focusing reflector in the vertical dimension. The imaging resolution is about 14 mm in the horizontal direction and 12 mm in the vertical direction at a distance of 3 m, and the image reconstruction time is less than 1 s. Although the mixed-scanning radar system can operate near real time, there still exist some defects: (1) the target needs to be stationary; (2) the imaging field of view is limited.
