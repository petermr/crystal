<p>The photoelectric nature of the of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> material was further probed by performing 
 <italic>I–V</italic> measurements at room temperature in a dark environment, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. We swept the source–drain bias voltage from 0 mV to 10 mV, with a standard wavelength-tunable laser (beam diameter: 10 mm) illuminating the 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> conductive channel. The illumination power was held at fixed power of 1.4 mW (power density: 1.78 mW/cm
 <sup>2</sup>). Then a strategy similar to the above-mentioned DC test was implemented to obtain the wavelength-dependent photocurrent. As is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, in contrast to the current in dark environment (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>dark</sub>), both 0° and 60° 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>ds</sub> curves show a distinguishable increase in the incident wavelength variation from 500 to 750 nm, which indicates a positive, wavelength-related photoconductance of the 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> device. On the other hand, a different response amplitude of the same illumination wavelength in terms of the different test TE/RE pairs of 0° and 60°, respectively, can be observed by comparing 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. Thus, the angle-dependent photosensitivity can be observed from the two figures.
