<p>Having now two likely structures, i.e., the 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic> and 
 <italic>Pc</italic>, a comparison with the experimental X-ray data show that actually only a small variation in the structure factors is noticeable, which due to the limited data quality in the GIXD experiment even does not allow us to pick the one over the other. In this particular case, we could find another criterion to justify the selection of the 
 <italic>Pc</italic> to being a better fitting choice than the 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic>,Â as it is discussed in 
 <xref rid="doc1" ref-type="other">part 2 of this work</xref> which is published separately. Raman spectroscopy was able to solve the puzzle. The vibrational spectra are excellent structural diagnostics since the lattice frequencies are extremely sensitive to the details of the crystal packing and in particular to the change in symmetry.

 </sup> Using computed Raman spectra for the two predicted structures and comparisons with experimentally obtained vibrational spectra show that the 
 <italic>Pc</italic> agrees well, while those spectra computed for the 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic> structure are unsatisfactory. We conclude that, because of the good match in lattice parameters, diffractogram and vibrational spectra, the computed 
 <italic>Pc</italic> minimum correctly describes the 
 <bold>form II</bold> crystal structure.
