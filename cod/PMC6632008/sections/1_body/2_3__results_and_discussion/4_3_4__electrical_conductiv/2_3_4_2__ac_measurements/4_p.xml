 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f007">Figure 7</xref> displays the impedance diagrams of the cathode in the temperature range between 750 and 900 °C, showing that the resistance decreases as the temperature increases, as expected. All the spectra were fitted with the equivalent circuit indicated in the inset, using the non-linear least squares fitting of the Z-view program. In the scheme, L represents the inductive process, Re the electrolyte resistance, R1 the charge transfer resistance and R2 the ORR resistance. As mentioned, the sum of R1 and R2 corresponds to the polarization resistance Rp. The fact that the electrode can be polarized by the charge transfer and reduction reactions, implies the appearance of capacitive processes (“double layer” effect), which occurs in parallel to the resistive processes. This is represented in the circuit as a constant phase element (CPE), which represents a time-dependent capacitive element (pseudo-capacitance). The obtained Rp values are presented in
