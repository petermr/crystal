<p>Another observation concerning the spatial resolution of the 2D image is that in place of utilizing the spatial resolution predicted by the optical analysis of the microscope, the spatial definition criteria proposed in Reference [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was adopted. Accordingly, spatial resolution is defined by the measurable minimum distances in the HRTEM image plane. The concept of minimum distance requires some additional explanation. The electron microscope image that was analyzed in this paper [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was obtained with an HRTEM JEOL 4000 EX-TEM (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA, USA) operating at 400 KeV [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The electron wavelength at this voltage was 0.00193 nm, i.e., on the order of 0.002 nm. According to the criteria of HRTM [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], with this wavelength of 0.002 nm, one should be able to measure distances of the order of 0.001 nm. However, the HRTEM JEOL 4000EX-TEM used for recording the image has a maximum classical spatial resolution of 0.14 nm [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical value. This rating is a consequence of the aberrations of the microscope that lead to the above calibrated resolution of the microscope. This is the reason that the “minimum distance that can be measured” criterion was introduced in Reference [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] as a definition for spatial resolution. For the same reason mentioned in Reference [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the same criterion was applied in this paper. The bicubic spline interpolation of the images was utilized to increase the spatial resolution of the images.
