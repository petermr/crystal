 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>b</italic>. The unit cell contains two formula units of Co
 <sub>3</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>. One of the two independent Co
 <sup>II</sup> atoms is sixfold coordinated in an approximately ideal octahedral fashion (Figure 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> a). The second is fivefold coordinated, giving a severely distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination polyhedron (Figure 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> b). The octahedrally coordinated Co ion is O‐corner‐sharing connected to six different phosphate ions; the Co inside the distorted bipyramidal polyhedron is only connected to four different anions (Figure 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Three of these are corner‐sharing and one is edge‐sharing connected to the metal. The asymmetric unit contains only one half of the formula unit, hence the octahedrally coordinated Co atom is located on a symmetry center and the fivefold coordinated Co atom is on a general position. To judge whether the latter polyhedron is closer to a square‐pyramidal or to a trigonal‐bipyramidal structure, the τ parameter proposed by Addison
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> was determined. It is defined as 
 <italic>τ</italic>=(
 <italic>β</italic>−
 <italic>α</italic>)60° where 
 <italic>β</italic> is the largest and 
 <italic>α</italic> the second largest ligand‐metal‐ligand angle. For an ideal trigonal‐bipyramidal geometry, 
 <italic>τ</italic> is unity and for an ideal square pyramidal geometry zero. Here, 
 <italic>τ</italic> adopts a value of 0.67, which suggests a predominately trigonal‐bipyramidal environment.
