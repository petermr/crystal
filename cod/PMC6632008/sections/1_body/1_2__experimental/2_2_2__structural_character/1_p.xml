<p>The product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase identification and to assess phase purity. The measurement was performed using a Bruker-AXS D8 diffractometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA, 40 kV, 30 mA) in Bragg-Brentano reflection geometry with CuK
 <sub>α</sub> radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), in the 10–64° 2θ range. A nickel filter allowed the elimination of Cu K
 <sub>β</sub> radiation.
