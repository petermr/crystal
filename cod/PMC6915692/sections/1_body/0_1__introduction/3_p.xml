<p>Regardless, the mainly described phase is still the monoclinic one, which is thermodynamically stable at room pressure and temperature. This structure exhibits some octahedral site twists that are different depending on the unit-cell axis. The different chevron patterns constituted by the octahedral framework are shown from the different

The angle of the chevrons being different along the crystallographic axes, the unit-cell parameters of a, b and c are then all different: 7.32 Å; 7.56 Å and 7.73 Å, respectively, according to the crystallographic data of the literature [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f001">Figure 1</xref>iv) may be difficult to discern for nano-sized WO
 <sub>3</sub> particles, leading to an intrinsic enlargement of the X-ray diffraction peaks, often associated with surface defects as well as oxygen sub-stoichiometry.
