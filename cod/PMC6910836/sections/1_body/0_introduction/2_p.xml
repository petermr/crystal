<p>The spectroscopic detection of subnanoscale materials, in general, is difficult because of a severely weak signal intensity that results from the small sizes of these materials, as well as the limited sensitivity and accuracy of conventional techniques. In addition, the surface coverage of SNCs on a support can be an issue. SNCs are not stable and will readily aggregate if they are not supported or if the surface coverage is overly high on a support. Thus, SNCs supported on carbon, silicate, graphene, and other substrates must be at a concentration as low as 0.4 weight % (wt %) to guarantee sufficient distance between neighboring clusters, so as to avoid surface agglomeration (
