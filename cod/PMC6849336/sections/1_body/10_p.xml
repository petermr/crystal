<p>Blue-emitting LEDs were fabricated with the device structure proposed by Gangishetty et al., where a TFB (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-
 <italic>s</italic>-butylphenyl) diphenylamine)]) layer covered with Nafion perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) is used as an HTL for improved hole injection.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>) (0.44% at 481 nm, OLA/OA-synthesized NCs), the brightness was approximately 10-fold higher and reached 2500 Cd/m
 <sup>2</sup> (vs 212 Cd/m
 <sup>2</sup> in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>)). We should also note that we were not able to fully suppress the EL from the TFB layer (at ∼430 nm) by the application of PFI, presumably because of the suboptimal thickness of the perovskite NC layer and hence electron injection into TFB.
