<p>One of the directions of research on auxetic materials is the analysis of simple atomic models with structural-level modifications and the influence of the latter on the material’s elastic properties. Not long ago, such nanoscale models were out of reach in the sense of preparation and, hence, also for practical applications. However, recent development of methods for nanostructure fabrication allows one to manufacture quasiplanar metamaterials at nanoscale, e.g., by atomic layer deposition techniques [

 <xref rid="B85-materials-12-00700" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] or nanowire [
 <xref rid="B86-materials-12-00700" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-materials-12-00700" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] metamaterials. Therefore, it is meaningful to search for such modifications at the nanoscale that lead to the decrease of Poisson’s ratio.
