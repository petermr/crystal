<p>This also makes perfect sense by comparing the IR vibrations calculated in periodic system to the ones calculated for a single molecule (also refer to 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01402">Table S1 in Supporting Materials</xref> presenting the potential energy distribution calculated for melamine). In the calculations that are based on a single molecule (vs. the model of crystalline lattice), the out-of-plane deformation vibrations (e.g., 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>twist</sub>NH
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>wagg</sub>NH
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>oop</sub>ring) are positioned at higher calculated wavenumbers, while the in-plane deformation vibrations are positioned at the lower calculated wavenumbers. Thus, the oscillators with the out-of-plane atomic motions have lower calculated force constants because of neglecting the surrounding crystalline planes. The neglecting of intra-plane interactions of melamine lead to a surprisingly miniscule decrease of the accuracy of the calculated NIR modes. The corresponding vibrations with in-plane atomic motions (primarily 
 <italic>ν</italic>NH
 <sub>2</sub>, but also 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>ip</sub>ring, 
 <italic>ν</italic>C-N[H
 <sub>2</sub>]) were mostly overestimated in the calculated frequencies, which was easily corrected by applying scaling. These modes are seemingly less affected by the intermolecular interactions of melamine in crystal lattice, including the effects of hydrogen-bonding.
