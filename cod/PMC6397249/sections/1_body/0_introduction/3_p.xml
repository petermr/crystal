<p id="Par4">Bulk metallic glasses based on precious metals with hallmarked concentrations for potential use in commercial jewelry and luxury products have been reported over the last decade

 </sup>. The development of these precious-metal glasses is motivated by a desire to combine the inherent appeal of the precious metal with the unique engineering properties (e.g. hardness, wear and corrosion resistance) and processability of a metallic glass. Metallic glass formation in gold-based alloy systems has been limited to a relatively narrow range of alloy compositions containing Si as well as other noble or near-noble metals such as Cu, Ag, and Pd (refs

 </sup>). These Au-based monolithic metallic glasses exhibit critical rod diameters typically up to 5 mm, and an essentially “pale” white-gold color
