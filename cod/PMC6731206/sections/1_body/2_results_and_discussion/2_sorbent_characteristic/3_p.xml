<p id="p0120">There are many examples of using different deposits zeolites to purify waste waters from heavy metals ions. The sorption of heavy metals Ni, Cd, Cr, Zn, Cu from surface water on natural and modified clinoptilolites of Kholinsky (Russia) deposit was investigated 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, cobalt sorption was studied by clinoptilolite of Mexican deposit 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, sorption mechanism of heavy metals Pb, Cu, Ni, Cd from individual and multicomponents solutions by clinoptilolite of one of the Ukraine deposits were considered 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, a set of experimental researches to remove metal ions from polluted (contaminated) waters by Bulgarian natural and modified zeolites was made 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The sorption properties of the activated carbon-zeolite composite prepared from coal fly ash for Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>, Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Cd
 <sup>2+</sup> and Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> were studied by V.K. Jha etc 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Shaobin Wang, Yuelian Peng 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reported that natural zeolites are used as effective adsorbents in water and wastewater treatment. P. Castaldi, etc. 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> studied natural zeolite from a formation in northern Sardinia (Italy), the adsorption capacity of the three cations decreases in the series Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Cd. G. Du etc. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> were shown that the adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) increases with the processing ions Fe(III) of natural zeolite. I.A.M. Ahmed, etc. 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> were studied the sorption characteristics of cadmium absorption by clinoptilolite and zeolite-Y. S. Slivović, etc. analyzed 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> the influences of the initial temperature, size and particle size on copper ions sorption on zeolite 13X in a batch reactor. G. Purna Chandra Rao, etc. were studied the sorption of cadmium and zinc from aqueous solutions by zeolite 4A, zeolite 13X and bentonite 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The sorption properties are arranged in a row in the following order: zeolite 4A&gt; zeolite 13X &gt; bentonite. Bahia Meroufel, etc. 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> were studied of zinc recovery from water solutions using kaolin in batch reactors. The adsorbed amount of Zn (II) ions increased with an increase in the initial concentration of adsorbate, pH and temperature. Obaid, Shamsan S., et al. 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, Zamzow M.J., et al. 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> were studied the removal of heavy metals and other cations from wastewater using zeolites.
