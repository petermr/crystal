 <caption> Charge transport properties of EuSn 2P 2. (A) Temperature-dependence of the (001) plane resistivity ρ xx between 1.8 and 300 K in the absence of an applied magnetic field. (B) Field-dependence of the Hall resistivity ρ yx at various temperatures (2 K, 10 K, 25 K, 70 K, 100 and 150 K) with applied field from 0 to 9 T. (C) Field-dependence of ρ xx for various temperatures (2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, and 70 K) on sweeping applied field from 9 to −9 T. (D) Magnetoresistance at the above temperatures normalized to the values at 0 applied magnetic field. </caption>
