<p>For the given spectrum the drift energy varies between 150 eV on the left-hand side and 700 eV at the Fermi edge. In turn, the energy resolution varies strongly from about 0.7 eV at the left-hand side to 3 eV at 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub>. The 3
 <italic>s</italic> signals are as strong as the 3
 <italic>p</italic> signals, reflecting that with increasing photon energy the partial cross sections of 
 <italic>s</italic>-states drop much weaker than all other partial cross sections (Trzhaskovskaya &amp; Yarzhemsky, 2018

 <italic>d</italic> doublet appears relatively intense despite the small content of 2% and the oxygen 1
 <italic>s</italic> signal appears very strong although this is only a surface contamination. Detailed spectra of smaller energy ranges will be shown in Fig 7.
