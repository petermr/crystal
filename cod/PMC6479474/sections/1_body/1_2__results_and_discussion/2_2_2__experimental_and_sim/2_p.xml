<p>The principle difference between the DVPT2 and GVPT2 approaches is the treatment of vibrational resonances; the latter method features an advanced correction for Fermi and Darling-Dennison resonances by the variational method [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The improvement does not seem to significantly affect the major NIR bands of melamine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>). However, improved method allows for calculations of three quanta transitions (i.e., second overtones, 3
 <italic>ν</italic>; and ternary combinations, 2
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>x</sub> + 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>, and 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>x</sub> + 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> + 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>). The addition of these minor bands slightly enhances the agreement, for example, below 6500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and in the region of 4400–4150 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This observation remains similar to our previous estimations that were based on the anharmonic study of methanol molecule and its deuterated isotopomers [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. We have therein concluded that the bands due to three quanta transitions are only responsible for minority (ca. 20%) of the NIR spectra of methanol [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These higher order bands are weak, overlapping bands, and the corresponding spectral information is “diffused” along the wavenumber axis [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A similar case may be reported for melamine, and it is probably shared by other molecules. There are some exceptions, e.g., in the literature, 3
 <italic>ν</italic>C=O has been reported to appear near 5150–5160 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in gas phase (and near 5122–5076 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in various solvents), as a well resolved band in some molecules with a C=O group [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. No such exceptions were observed for melamine, and close inspection of the theoretical spectra confirms that the majority of the experimental bands were reproduced by both approximations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The more comprehensive, but also resource intensive, calculations of additional three quanta transitions of melamine allowed for explaining finer features that were observed in its NIR spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Primarily, the influence of higher order bands may be seen throughout the 6500–5200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region and in the vicinity of 4300–4100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). In the former case (6500–5200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region), these bands remain very weak. For the latter (4300–4100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region), there appears a marked band overlapping that gives rise to a broadened feature of moderate intensity at 4300–4200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and also a similar one appearing at the high-frequency wing of the ~4090 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> band (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). The present study of NIR spectra of crystalline melamine may be compared with our earlier calculations of NIR spectra of medium-chain fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast to the previously observed significance of the hydrogen-bonding interaction for the NIR region of crystalline sorbic acid [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], NIR bands of melamine reveal surprisingly low sensitivity to the hydrogen-bonding. This occurs despite the fact that melamine interacts strongly and it forms multiple hydrogen-bonds in crystalline states, as recently demonstrated by Yuan et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We will discuss in detail the reasons for such distinctiveness of NIR region of melamine in
