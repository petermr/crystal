<p>There are many reasons for concentration quenching, including multipolar interaction or exchange interaction. The interaction types between the two types of incentives can be calculated by the following formula [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]: 
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>I</italic>/
  <italic>x</italic> = 
  <italic>k</italic>(1 + 
  <italic>β</italic>(
  <italic>x</italic>)
  <italic>
   <sup>Q</sup>
  </italic>
  <sup>/3</sup>)
  <sup>−1</sup>
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>x</italic> is the concentration of Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> activator, and 
 <italic>k</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic> are constants. 
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>x</italic> is the ratio of the emission intensity to the doping concentration of activator. The 
 <italic>Q</italic> value determines the interaction type for the concentration quenching effect. When the values of 
 <italic>Q</italic> are 3, 6, 8, and 10, the interaction could be classified as exchange interactions, dipole–dipole, dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole interactions, respectively. Thus, the results of lg(
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>x</italic>) and lg(
 <italic>x</italic>) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01296-f002">Figure 2</xref>c to obtain the 
 <italic>Q</italic> value. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01296-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, the relationship between lg(
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>x</italic>) and lg(
 <italic>x</italic>) was linear. After data fitting, 
 <italic>Q</italic>/3 was found to be 1.259. Therefore, the calculated 
 <italic>Q</italic> value is relatively close to the theoretical value of 3, which represents that the concentration quenching mechanism for the BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors is exchange interaction.
