<p>Evaluation of fetal development using sonography is clinically performed mainly after the second trimester. OSL measurement in the femur for fetal growth assessment and pregnancy dating is accepted worldwide because femur length and OSL show a strong positive correlation with CRL [

 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such strong correlation was also confirmed in the present study. In contrast, findings for morphological features in the femur have not yet been applied to the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia. Currently, limited studies have reported the reference values for fetal limb bones at 9–16 weeks of gestation using transvaginal sonography [
