<p>Experiments conducted in the presence of sulfate also produced only zabuyelite crystals, as identified with XRD, DRIFTS, and Raman spectroscopy (vibrational spectroscopy results shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>a,b). As for the 1 M NaCl solution, nucleation in these experiments was observed to be slower than in the absence of additives. These crystals also had a morphology similar to the crystals observed with monovalent chloride salts and a similar length (10 μm) to those produced in LiBr with Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> experiments (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>e). However, for these crystals the {010} form was observed to decrease in size (

  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>), and thin {100} forms were also expressed. In addition, some crystals showed evidence of rounded channels penetrating the crystal along its elongation axis (arrow in

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>e). Rosettes were also observed in the sulfate experiments. An increase in the FWHM of the 1093 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> carbonate symmetrical stretching band to 9.3 ± 0.3 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> was also seen in the Raman spectra when sulfate was present in the growth solution. In addition, the FWHM of the 31° peak in the XRD was also found to increase in comparison to the LiBr with Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> experiments. However, the FWHM value was similar to those observed in the NaCl experiments, which showed no increase in the FWHM of the carbonate symmetrical stretch in the Raman spectra.
