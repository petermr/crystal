<p>The new bright yellow-green luminescent six-coordinate complexes, (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>Him] (
 <bold>2</bold>) and (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>Mim] (
 <bold>3</bold>), were synthesized by the reactions of (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>] (
 <bold>1</bold>) with excess five-membered N-heterocyclic ligands in water. The reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> with an excess amount of pyz in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> gave (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>pyz] (
 <bold>4</bold>) in a high yield. The similar reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> with an excess amount of Him or Mim in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> produced the six-coordinate complex coordinated with the Him or Mim ligand which occupies at the axial site of the nitridorhenium(V) complex. In (PPh

 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)

 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>[ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>Mim]·Mim (
 <bold>6</bold>), furthermore, additional one mole ratio of noncoordinate Him or Mim was included. In the infrared (IR) spectra, the absorption bands ascribed to the N-heterocyclic ligands were observed in addition to those of the (PPh

 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the new complexes dissolved in CD
 <sub>3</sub>CN showed the signals of N-heterocyclic ligands and (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sup>+</sup>. Each integral signal intensity ratio of the N-heterocycle to (PPh
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sup>+</sup> was 1:2 for 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, or 
 <bold>4</bold> and 1:1 for 
 <bold>5</bold> or 
 <bold>6</bold>. These ratios were in good agreement with the results of the single-crystal X-ray analyses of the complexes. In 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>, one set of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals of Him and Mim was only observed, suggesting that the dissociation of Him and Mim ligands from the rhenium ion rapidly occurred in the solutions as the result of strong trans effect of the nitrido. The single-crystal X-ray structures of the new complexes were determined. The crystal structures of the complex anions of 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, and 
 <bold>6</bold> are displayed in

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02749/suppl_file/ao9b02749_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link>. The structures and selected bond distances/angles of the new complexes are summarized in

 </xref>. Each complex anion has a distorted octahedral structure with one nitrido atom being located at the axial site and an N-heteroaromatic ligand being occupied at the trans site to the nitrido. The four cyanido ions coordinate at the equatorial positions with the Re–C bond distances of 2.094(3)–2.128(6) Å and the N(nitrido)≡Re–C angles of 96.41(10)–101.32(19)°. The bond distance of Re≡N(nitrido) is in the range of 1.659(4)–1.671(4) Å. The Re–C and Re≡N(nitrido) bond distances are similar to those of the previously reported tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complexes.

 </sup> The N(nitrido)≡Re–N(aromatic) angles are almost linear [175.82(9)–178.48(14)°]. The Re–N(aromatic) bond distances are in the range 2.410(4)–2.496(2) Å, which is significantly long because of the trans influence of the nitrido ligand, while the distances are small compared to those in [ReN(CN)

 <sup>2–</sup> (L = six-membered N-heterocyclic ligand) [2.45(1)–2.589(5) Å].
 <sup>

 </sup> This difference may be due to the steric hindrance because the five-membered aromatic ring is sterically less hindered than the six-membered ring. The complex anions in 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> and the anions in 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> have very similar geometries, respectively. In 
 <bold>5</bold>, a noncoordinating Him is involved per complex anion and the N–H···N hydrogen bond is formed between the nitrogen atoms in the coordinate Him and that in the noncoordinate Him [N7···N8, 2.804(6) Å]. The noncoordinate Him interacts with the [ReN(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>2–</sup> unit through the N–H···N hydrogen bond to the nitrogen atom of the cyanido [N3···N9, 2.993(7) Å] and the C–H···N bond to the nitrido atom [N1···C9, 3.264(8) Å] and to the cyanido [N5···C10, 3.438(8) Å]. In addition, the C–H···N interaction is shown between the nitrido atom and a phenyl ring of PPh
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> [N1···C26, 3.369(8) Å]. In 
 <bold>6</bold>, a noncoordinating Mim is included per complex anion, while there is no hydrogen bonding interaction between the coordinate and noncoordinate Mim molecules. The noncoordinate Mim interacts with the nitrido atom of the complex unit by the C–H···N bond [N1···C12, 3.271(6) Å] and with the cyanide ligand by the C–H···N bond [N5···C10, 3.344(5) Å, N3···C9, 3.384(6) Å]. The C–H···N interactions are formed between the nitrido atom and phenyl rings of PPh
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> ions [N1···C22, 3.316(5) Å; N1···C46, 3.494(5) Å]. In 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>, the weak interactions show as the O–H···N hydrogen bonds among water molecules and the nitrogen atoms of the cyanido ligands [O1···N3, 2.973(5) Å; O2···N3, 2.958(4) Å; O3···N4, 2.853(4) Å for 
 <bold>2</bold> and O1···N4, 2.864(8) Å; O2···N3, 2.930(6) Å; O3···N3, 2.89(1) Å for 
 <bold>3</bold>] and as the N–H···N bond between the coordinate imidazole and the cyanido [N5···N7, 2.854(4) Å] for 
 <bold>2</bold>. Furthermore, the interaction is formed between the nitrido and a carbon atom of a PPh
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> ion [N1···C46, 3.276(5) Å for 
 <bold>2</bold> and N1···C43, 3.39(1) Å for 
 <bold>3</bold>]. In 
 <bold>4</bold>, the weak interactions show as the N–H···N and C–H···N bonds between the pyrazole and cyanido [N5···N7, 2.955(4) Å and N5···C7, 3.133(4) Å] and C–H···N bonds between the pyrazole and CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN [C6···N8, 3.268(4) Å]. Moreover, the interactions are formed between the nitrido and carbon atoms of PPh
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> ions [N1···C18, 3.385(4) Å and N1···C35, 3.599(3) Å].
