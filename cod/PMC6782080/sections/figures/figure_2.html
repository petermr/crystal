 <caption> The preparation steps of ZnO nanospike cross-sections using the geometric shadow-FIB technique. ( a) (Left) As-grown ZnO nanospikes from a Zn spherical particle. (Right) Amorphous carbon was deposited via electron-beam-induced decomposition to embed the spikes in a matrix material. ( b) The first step of FIB trench milling and the lift-out process. ( c) The rotated (180Â°) specimen was milled with a Ga ion beam using the silicon substrate as protection against severe damage to the carbon matrix. ( d) An ion-milled lamella with electron-beam-transparent cross-section specimens (red circles). </caption>
