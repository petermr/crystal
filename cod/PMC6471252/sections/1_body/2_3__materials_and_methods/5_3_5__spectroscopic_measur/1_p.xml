<p>The UV-Vis luminescence spectra were recorded with a Labram HR800 (Horiba Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) spectrometer coupled with an Olympus BX61 confocal microscope (Olympus Inc., Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) and equipped with a Peltier-cooled CCD detector Synapsis (Horiba Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA), 1024:256 pixel. A diode-pumped, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser 532 nm, output laser power: 100 mW (Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was utilized as the excitation source. A holographic grating with 600 lines/mm was used. The calibration of the instrument was performed using a 520-cm

 </inline-formula> Raman signal of a silicon wafer. The spectra were collected for the same crystal, which was used for structure determinations, at several pressures. In some cases, the conditions coincided with those for the crystal structure determination. Analogously to the X-ray data, the pressure inside the gasket hole was determined by measuring the reference ruby fluorescence.
