<p>The crystalline structure is connected by bridging tetra­cyano­platinate moieties, which form a two-dimensional grid that propagates along the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane (Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>). As imposed by symmetry, no deviation from linearity for the Fe—N—C—Pt linkages is observed [Fe—N—C = 180°, N—C—Pt = 180°, C—Pt—C = 180°]. The distance between parallel cyano­metallic layers is 7.973 (6) Å. The guest acetone mol­ecules are located between the cyano­metallic layers. Each oxygen atom of the coordinated water mol­ecules inter­acts with acetone by O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref>, Table 1
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref>), creating a three-dimensional supramolecular framewor. The size of the available voids between the cyano­metallic layers allows the acetone mol­ecules to rotate freely, thus leading to disorder of the acetone mol­ecules over four positions.
