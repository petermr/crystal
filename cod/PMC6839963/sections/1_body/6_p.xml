<p id="P8">Let’s consider the 
 <bold>COS</bold> and 
 <bold>CRS</bold> groups in more detail. When the M
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecule is set to interact with Ni(OEP), the energy distribution of the optimized structures changes considerably. Instead of 2–3 unique minima found for the isolated M
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecules, calculations predict the appearance of multiple different minima in the 
 <bold>COS-0,1</bold> structures. This shows that the non-covalent interaction with Ni(OEP) breaks the orientation isotropy of the icosahedral fullerene cage. Second, the Δ
 <italic>E</italic> spread of the 
 <bold>COS</bold> structures (~12 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) is increased four-fold in comparison to the isolated Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> and YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecules. These differences between M
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecules and 
 <bold>COS</bold> systems clearly point to the considerable effect of the intermolecular interaction on the orientation of the endohedral cluster in M
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) complexes.
