 <caption> Lithostratigraphic column for the lava pile on the left with closure temperatures determined for all the samples in this study (red dots) and previously 16 (blue open circles). Thermal evolution over time for each layer of the Theo’s Flow lava pile. The peridotite and pyroxenite emplacements are approximately coeval and they are followed by the gabbro – pyroxenite emplacement 10 years later. </caption>
