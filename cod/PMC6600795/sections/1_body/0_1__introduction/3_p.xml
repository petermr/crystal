It will be proven possible to extract information from HRTEM patterns using the same methodology developed for moir√© and speckle patterns in the field of visible optics. The experimentally observed atom configurations in the HRTEM images are utilized to draw important conclusions on the kinematics of crystalline arrays. This is a critical work, which enables a deeper understanding of the behavior of materials and can lead in the future to the prediction of failure at much earlier stages in the life cycle of a material. This may result in preventative measures as well as provide new guidelines in the manufacturing of metals.
