<p id="Par15">In an attempt to further decrease the diffusion distance of Ti, four-layer cycle stacks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, sequence 2) were analysed. In the ToF-SIMS depth profile in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the peaks from two of Ti layers merged into one at the designed Ni location even in the as-deposited state. In the meantime, the Ni peak shifted toward Cu and the position of Ni and Ti were staggered. The Cu peak remained unchanged. Again, mixing between Ti and Ni occurred during deposition.
