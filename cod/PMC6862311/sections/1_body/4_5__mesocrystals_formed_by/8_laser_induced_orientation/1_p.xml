<p>In the previous sections we discussed the studies of the orientational order in the systems in equilibrium. The recently developed XFELs are capable to produce femtosecond X-ray pulses that allow to probe fast dynamics at nanoscale, for example, molecular dynamics. The potential of AXCCA to study the evolution of the orientational order in the time-resolved X-ray scattering experiment on solvated molecules was demonstrated in reference [

In this work, the aqueous molecules of tetrakis-μ-pyrophosphitodiplatinate (II) (PtPOP) were excited by a short 50 fs optical laser pulse (pump) with a wavelength of 395 nm. From the whole ensemble of randomly oriented PtPOP molecules, the linearly polarized optical light selectively excites only the molecules, in which the Pt-Pt axis is oriented parallel to the external laser electric field
