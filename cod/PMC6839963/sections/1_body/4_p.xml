 </sup> The energy difference between the two structures is only 2.3 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is consistent with the free rotation of Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N within C
 <sub>80</sub> at room temperature. For an isolated YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecule, the procedure resulted in 3 unique structures (
