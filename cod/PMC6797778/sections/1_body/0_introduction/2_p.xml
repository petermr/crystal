<p id="Par3">The ferroelectricity is likely to appear in stacked TMDC rather than in single layer form. It was recently shown that the horizontal mirror symmetry of individual layers is broken by the stacking in 3R structure (
 <italic>P</italic>3
 <italic>m</italic>1 for finite layers and 
 <italic>R</italic>3
 <italic>m</italic> for bulk), hence the vertical electric polarization manifests itself in accordance with the global polar symmetry

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. The direction of polarization depends on the stacking sequence, hence is reversed by the interlayer translation between the AB and AC stackings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup> as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The possibility of ferroelectric switching in the 3R structure via the interlayer translation has not been explored to date. Meanwhile, the multilayer distorted 1T WTe
 <sub>2</sub> showed switching of the polarization
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> and the topological phase
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup> in the recent experiments, probably via the interlayer translation. The stability of the 3R structure MoS
 <sub>2</sub> is comparable to that of the 2H structure and can be selectively synthesized among competing polytypes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. It is hence a viable candidate for 2D ferroelectrics in which the fascinating phenomena such as high electron mobility
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup> and valleytronics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> can be explored altogether.
