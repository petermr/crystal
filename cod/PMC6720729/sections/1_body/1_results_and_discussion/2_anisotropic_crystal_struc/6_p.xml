<p>To characterize the optical anisotropy, a few layered 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake was mechanically exfoliated and transferred onto a pre-cleaned Si/SiO
 <sub>2</sub> wafer, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the selected two areas as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. Then the ADRDM measurement was conducted by rotating the incident angle (θ) of polarization from 0° to 360°, and the different values of 
 <italic>N</italic>(θ) are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> as a function of incident angle. The absolute values of 
 <italic>N</italic> were taken from the two selected areas of the 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> sample, indicating a highly different reflectance with the incident angle variation. Meanwhile, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows the ADRDM images, which were taken at different angles with 
 <italic>N</italic>(θ) changes plotted in color scale. Both the quantitative and the visualization results demonstrate that 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is crystalline with a highly anisotropic optical property.
