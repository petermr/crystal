<p>To rationalize the origin of this cooperative effect inherent to the longer azo–BTA stacks, the cumulative parameter

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f006">Figure 6</xref>). First, the data from this plot indicate that the local interactions become stronger as the stack grows: The values for longer stacks are systematically shifted to more negative energies. This is a result of the binding to a larger number of molecules that are located beyond the nearest neighbors. Correspondingly, the circumstance that the outer stars only have binding partners to one side, leads to a weakening of their attachment. Hence, we observe approximately halved energy values when comparing the outer stars to centrally located molecules within the same cluster. Secondly, the coupling closer to the middle of the column is stronger than the interactions near the edges of the stack. Consider, however, that the irregular shape of curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04387-f006">Figure 6</xref> could hint at weak points and irregularities in the cluster themselves caused by effects coming from solvent molecules and thermal motion simulated explicitly in MD runs. The mentioned irregularities are locations where a cluster may be destabilized in ensuing photoisomerization events when the clusters are exposed to light.
