<p>Photoelectrons from the valence band are the fastest and thus easily accessible by a ToF spectrometer, which is inherently a high-pass filter. A crucial question prior to the experiments was whether core-levels are accessible as well. Indeed, XPS of core-levels was possible, as well as fast recording of XPD patterns. The information content of XPS as a sensitive 
 <italic>chemical</italic> probe and XPD as a probe of the 
 <italic>geometric structure</italic> ideally complement the 
 <italic>electronic structure</italic> information of valence-band momentum mapping. XPS survey spectra in terms of wide-range ToF spectra (several hundred eV wide) give information on the chemical state of sample and surface, with a sensitivity in the few-% range. The high-pass characteristics of ToF instruments in combination with the excitation at the photon-pulse period 
 <italic>T</italic> can lead to 
 <italic>temporal aliasing</italic>: electrons with flight times longer or shorter by a multiple of 
 <italic>T</italic> (condition Δτ = ±
 <italic>nT</italic>) fall into the same time interval causing undesired overlapping signals. Systematic simulations uncovered the conditions under which temporal coincidence of unwanted signals from other core-levels, Auger electrons or signals from higher orders of the monochromator/undulator can occur. We show examples of this effect, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> a 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>
 <italic>MM</italic> Auger signal released by third-order photons with energy as high as 
 <italic>h</italic>ν = 11.25 keV, and discuss various strategies to avoid or suppress such temporal coincidences. The signals from faster electrons can be easily identified by their different focusing properties, suggesting geometric beam blanking as a suppression method.
