<p>The scattering layer with embedded TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was fabricated using the conventional slit coating method. However, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are hard to disperse in PGMA solvent, therefore they were not dispersed uniformly. The coating thickness of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle scattering layer was 1.5 μm, then 1 μm thick SiO
 <sub>2</sub> was coated as the planarization layer. 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the optical properties of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle scattering layer, such as transmittance and haze. We observed 70% of total transmittance at 550 nm wavelength and 55–82% of haze. The surface of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticle layer was rough, even though the planarization layer was applied on it. Considering its surface roughness, it would cause poor characteristics in the subsequent LTPS TFT process. Due to poor dispersivity of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in the PGMA solvent, the curing temperature was limited to 300 °C, which was lower than the annealing process temperature of 580 °C in the subsequent LTPS TFT process. Despite the high refractive index of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, the use of conditions such as particle size, sorts of solvent, and better dispersion of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles is required.
