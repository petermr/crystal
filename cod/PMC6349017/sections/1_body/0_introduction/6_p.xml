<p>Our previous work
 <xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> investigated the above two types of PT mechanisms at the ZnO(101[combining macron]0)â€“liquid-water interface using MD simulations. We found that at ZnO(101[combining macron]0), the rate of adlayer-PT is greater than the rate of surface-PT. Moreover, we and others
 <xref rid="cit33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> found that the PT reactions are aided by hydrogen-bond fluctuations in the immediate environment around the dissociating water molecules, similar to PT reactions in NaOH solutions of high concentrations.
