<p>At first sight, the apparent rigidity of the polyoxometalate cage would prevent from a significant vibrational decoherence. While this observation could be true, we must not forget that the Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ion is coordinated by an apical water molecule, which is also embedded in the cage but not covalently bonded to it. This could result in a certain freedom of movement that allows the vibration of this water molecule with respect to the Gd
 <sup>III</sup> position. Thus, both independent and collective motions of Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ion and apical water molecule could be examples of significantly coupled low-frequency vibrations. In addition, there also exists another important decohering movement concerning rotations of magnetic nuclei. For instance, it is well-known that rotation of methyl groups -CH
 <sub>3</sub> can couple to energy levels encoding spin qubits (Zecevic et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Eaton and Eaton, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In case of 
 <bold>1</bold>, the rotation would take place in the coordinating water molecule, whose magnetic nuclei in the form of two hydrogen atoms would couple to the Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ion. Of course, this would deserve further investigation, since the forced removal of this apical water molecule could result in an enhanced coherence for the three qubits encoded in the energy level structure of 
 <bold>1</bold>. In fact, a family of lanthanide-based POMs with a similar coordination environment but excluding the apical water molecule has recently been theoretically explored (Baldov√≠ and Kondinski, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), whose Gd
 <sup>III</sup> derivative could also offer a promising platform to design a robust single-molecule quantum processor.
