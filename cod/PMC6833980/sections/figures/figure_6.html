 <caption> Calculated intensities of IFRB in the range of x from 5 to 30 mm for β being ( a) −0.02 mm −1, ( b) −0.01 mm −1 and ( c) 0.0 mm −1. The inset shows the calculated intensities of IFRB (black curve) for β = −0.02 mm −1 and IFMRB for β = 0.02 mm −1 (red dashed curve) in the range of x from 5.5 to 8.5 mm [the shaded region in ( a)]. </caption>
