 </sup>, the FWHM for the actual grain refinement broadening and the computed crystallite sizes for the four plane reflections of 111, 200, 220 and 311. It is apparent that the instrumental broadening in the present study may have only a limited influence on the overall FWHM at each coordinate. Moreover, the overall FWHM is significantly larger than the actual broadening by the reduced grain sizes and thus the metastable Al alloy after natural aging exhibits significant compositional broadening. The crystallite sizes of ~25–34 nm were estimated after the deconvolution of the line broadening where the line broadening by grain refinement is anticipated as independent of the magnitude of the scattering vector. The result is reasonably consistent with the TEM observations taken at both the center and edge of the Al immediately after HPT for 100 turns as shown in Fig.

Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude that the nanostructured metastable Al is capable of retaining a consistent grain size for at least two months of natural aging at room temperature.
