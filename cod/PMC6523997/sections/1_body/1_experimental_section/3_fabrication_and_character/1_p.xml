 <sub>3</sub>was used as a comparison. ITO and glass were cleaned by ultrasonication in water, acetone, and 2-propanol sequentially, dried with air flow, and UV–ozone treated for 30 min. Before spin coating, a N
 <sub>2</sub> flow is blown over the surface to remove dust or particles. Without the 3-CPACl additive, the precursor solution results in a yellow milky solution due to the low solubility of PbI
 <sub>2</sub> in DMF. To remove PbI
 <sub>2</sub> particles, the solution has to be filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Filtration is not necessary in the presence of the additive. Each of the solutions was spin-coated on the substrates with a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s under ambient conditions (no acceleration factor was applied). The one-step deposition method with sprayed antisolvent (diethylether, DEE) was used. After 15 s from the start of the spin-coating programme, 0.4 mL of DEE was sprayed within ∼0.5 s over the precursor perovskite layer at a fixed height of 3 cm between the needle tip and the surface. A metal gasket from an high-performance liquid chromatography setup was used as a height fixation. After spin-coating, thin films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h.
