<p>The cartilage structure influences bone structure formation, as ossification occurs as if the cartilage structure is the blue print replaced by the bone structure. Identifying how the normal cartilage is formed before ossification is essential. Nevertheless, the initial morphogenesis of the femur before ossification (chondrogenic stage) during the embryonic period has not been fully described, except for in limited classical studies [

Furthermore, how the morphological features of the cartilage structure may be replaced by those of the bone structure has not been fully shown, because previous studies had mainly examined two-dimensional (2-D) sections using histology and radiographs or gross view after dissection and these lacked precise quantitative information about the three-dimensional (3-D) formation of the femur. For example, previous studies had reported angle measurements such as femoral neck anteversion (∠FNA), femoral neck shaft angle (∠FNS), and obliquity of the shaft (∠OBS) during the fetal period. Such measurements may be useful for indicating changes in the shape of the femur, although data remain limited and controversial [
