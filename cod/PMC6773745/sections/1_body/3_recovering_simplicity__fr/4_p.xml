<p id="Par12">In this context, perhaps the bigger challenge in complex materials science is to develop general methodologies for finding the right interaction model and corresponding theory that allow complex structures and their underlying physics to be understood as simply as possible. Whereas historical approaches have relied heavily on the personal insight of key individuals in the field

 </sup>, machine-learning approaches might offer an opportunity to capture this insight and make it more widely available. One might also learn from the frustrated magnetism community, where mean-field theory is exploited to fit the data for complex magnetic states directly in terms of pairwise interactions, avoiding the generation of atomistic models altogether
