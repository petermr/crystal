<p>Tungsten ditelluride, WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, belongs to the class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). These materials exhibit many different crystal structures, such as hexagonal (
 <italic>2H</italic>), monoclinic (
 <italic>1T</italic>), and orthorhombic (
 <italic>T
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>) (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>). WTe
 <sub>2</sub> crystallizes in a layered orthorhombic structure (also known as the 
 <italic>T
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> phase; 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), in which the tungsten atoms are octahedrally coordinated by the tellurium atoms, and the successive layers in between are rotated by 180° (

  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>21</italic>
 </xref>). Because of strong intermetallic bonding, the tungsten atoms form slightly buckled zigzag chains resulting in distortion of the tellurium octahedra (around each tungsten atom) (

 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> shows a typical x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of 
 <italic>c</italic> axis–oriented WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals investigated in this work. The (00l) diffraction peaks confirm the presence of the single-crystalline 
 <italic>T
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> phase of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>). The lack of inversion symmetry in the 
 <italic>T
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> phase of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> (polar space group, 
 <italic>Pmn</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>) has played an important role in its identification as a type II Weyl semimetal (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>). Unlike most TMDCs, WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is a semimetal in its native ground state (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>), instead of being a semiconductor. We confirmed the semimetallic ground state of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> by electrical transport measurements (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The resistance of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> decreases with decreasing temperature from room temperature down to 10 K, a behavior typical of metallic systems. Furthermore, magnetoresistance measurements at 30 mK with magnetic fields up to 10 T reveal pronounced Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations with four main frequencies (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). These oscillations confirm the existence of four well-defined Fermi surfaces, consisting of two sets of electron and hole pockets (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>25</italic>
 </xref>). The presence of both free electrons and holes is believed to be the origin of the extremely large, nonsaturated magnetoresistance in WTe
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>28</italic>
 </xref>). Given the existence of metallic conduction down to 30 mK, and the fact that noncentrosymmetry is a necessary but insufficient requirement for a material to be ferroelectric, an intriguing question arises: Is semimetallic WTe
 <sub>2</sub> with a noncentrosymmetric space group (
 <italic>Pmn</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>) a ferroelectric (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>)?
