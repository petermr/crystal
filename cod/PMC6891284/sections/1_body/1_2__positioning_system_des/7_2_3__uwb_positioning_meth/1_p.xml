<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04980-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the UWB positioning system builds a reference on the basis of the fixed reference nodes in the four corners of the room (anchors) and a mobile node (node labels) mounted on the robot. UWB communication between the mobile node and the fixed nodes is achieved via wireless data transmission [
