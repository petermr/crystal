<p>The degradation experiment of toluene showed that the degradation efficiency of Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was higher than that of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and P25. To explain this phenomenon, photoluminescence spectra (PL) were employed under the excitation of light of the same wavelength (254 nm) as the degradation experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f011">Figure 11</xref>). The main peak positions of all catalysts were the same, distributed at 400, 414, 442, 455 and 471 nm, and no new emission peaks appeared at the PL of Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. The peak at 400 nm corresponds to the recombination of electrons and holes of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>; the other peaks were probably produced by oxygen vacancies or band edge free excitons [

 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The peak intensity of Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> at 400 nm is obviously weakened, which shows that the doping of iron has an obvious inhibitory effect on the recombination of electrons and holes. The weakening trend of peak intensity is completely consistent with the degradation at different catalysts, which shows that the doping of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> has an optimum concentration and that 1% Fe may be the optimal doping concentration. The doping level was insufficient at 0.5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> may become the recombination center of electrons and holes, leading to reduced catalytic performance, because of the high iron content at 5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>.
