  <p>(
   <italic>a</italic>) Data collected at various different center wavelengths for CsLaNb
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>7</sub>, showing the difference in data range, resolution and intensity as described in Table 1
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref> for 60 Hz data only. Shorter wavelengths provide information at much shorter 
   <italic>d</italic> spacing (higher 
   <italic>Q</italic>). (
   <italic>b</italic>) Selected region of the data showing that the longer wavelengths provide better resolution and statistics. (
   <italic>c</italic>)–(
   <italic>e</italic>) Rietveld refinement of LaB
   <sub>6</sub> (SRM 660b) using center wavelengths of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.665 Å in the high-resolution mode. The light-blue dots are the observed intensity, the navy-blue line is the calculated intensity, and also shown are the difference plot and tick markers. The values of full width at half-maximum reported in Fig. 6
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref> are obtained from these fits. The overall goodness parameters for all three histograms are 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>wp</sub> = 6.84% and χ
   <sup>2</sup> = 4.48.
