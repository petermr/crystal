 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01296-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows the XRD patterns of Bi
 <sub>1−x</sub>OCl:xPr
 <sup>3+</sup> (x = 0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) samples and the standard pattern of BiOCl (PDF NO. 82-485). All the diffraction peaks of Bi
 <sub>1−x</sub>OCl:xPr
 <sup>3+</sup> samples matched well with the BiOCl standard card. Almost no impurity peaks were presented. The addition of Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions with different doping concentration had no significant effect on the crystalline structure of BiOCl host. Thus, it can be concluded that Bi
 <sub>1−x</sub>OCl:xPr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors with stable structure can be easily prepared by this method.
