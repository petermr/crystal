<p>The analysis of magnetic characteristics and the dynamics of their changes as a result of annealing was carried out using the Mössbauer spectroscopy method (MS1104Em spectrometer, Chernogolovka, Moscow Oblast, Russia). The Mossbauer spectrometer was calibrated at room temperature using a standard α-Fe absorber. For processing and analyzing the Mossbauer spectra, methods were used to restore the distributions of the hyperfine parameters of the Mossbauer spectrum, taking into account a priori information about the object of study, implemented in the SpectrRelax program [
