<p id="Par25">SAROM has some limitations. The theoretically determined orientation resolution varies with the orientation of the grain. Typically, the theoretical variation is well below 1° (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Instrumental implementation implies that the error may increase up to 2°, which however still is sufficient for most applications. SAROM cannot be used on materials with high fluorescence background at the excitation wavelength of the laser source. However, the polycrystalline sapphire sample presented fluorescence at the grain boundaries, which we used as a perfect mark for grain visualization and exploited for further segmentation (Supplementary Figs.
