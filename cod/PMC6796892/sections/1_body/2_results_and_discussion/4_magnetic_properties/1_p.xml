PTO is a well-known nonmagnetic compound. Our total energy calculation reveals that the C-AF is the ground state for other compositions. It is to be noted that the C-AF and G-AF states are almost degenerate (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01176/suppl_file/ao9b01176_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link> in the Supporting Information). The present observation of C-AF state as a magnetic ground state for PVO is consistent with experimental observation of a two-dimensional C-AF phase and also with other theoretical studies.

The energy difference increases linearly as the concentration of V increases due to the increase in localized d electrons density per cell making the antiferromagnetic state more stable. We have extrapolated the Δ

 <italic>x</italic> ∼ 0.123. This is in agreement with previous theoretical finding by Ricci et al.
