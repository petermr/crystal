<p>Microstructural features, such as grain boundaries or precipitates, also lead to variations in the hit density on the detector. These variations are caused by the local magnification effect [

 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the evaporation field of various phases is different, which leads to the appearance of local curvature and hence magnification. Grain boundaries are defective regions in the materialâ€™s microstructure, and as such can usually be observed on the detector hit map via the hit density modification they induce locally.
