<p>The antioxidant activity was evaluated as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) against ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) disodium salt) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals. According to the results, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03556-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the Fe complex shows the highest antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 153 ± 6 µM and 193 ± 5 µM against ABTS and DPPH radicals, respectively. The activities of the other compounds were too small to determine IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. For this reason, the inhibition percentages at a concentration of 200 µM were compared in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03556-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, which showed that the free ligand exhibited a higher inhibition capacity against ABTS than the Cu and Mn complexes, despite the lack of a metal center.
