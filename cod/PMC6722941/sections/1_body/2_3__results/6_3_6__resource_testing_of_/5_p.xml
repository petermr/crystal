<p>As is evident from the represented data for specimens with the formed phase of iron oxide in the structure, a rise in the charging capacity is observed. This increase is attributable to the fact that the principal lithiation processes take place on iron oxide according to the following conversion reaction:
 <disp-formula>6Li + Fe
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub> =&gt; 2Fe + 3Li
  <sub>2</sub>O
 </disp-formula>
