 <caption> Ion-O RDFs. (a) Na +-O RDF in the first three layers and solution. (b) Same as (a) but for Cl –. (c) Na +-O RDF for two kinds of Na + in the first layer, namely, coordinating with (labeled as type I) and without (labeled as type II) counter ions. Here, “total” denotes the sum of type I and type II. (d) Same as (c) but for Cl – in the first layer. The insets show the focus view of the first peak of ion-O RDF. </caption>
