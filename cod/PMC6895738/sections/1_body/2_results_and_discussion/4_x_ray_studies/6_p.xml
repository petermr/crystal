 <italic>b</italic> may be the water adsorption from the air, the dissociation of its molecules, and the intercalation of the oxygen into the layers with the formation of the additional layer of the oxygen octahedra. If our assumption is correct, then when this sample is heated above 373 K, its structure should return to its original state, since water adsorption is a reversible process [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In order to verify this, a study of NCN0.25 using powder X-ray diffraction in the temperature interval 293–523 K has been performed. The heating of NCN0.25 has been performed in two stages: first, the sample was heated to 423 K and then cooled to 343 K with the same step of 10 K and isothermal holding at each point for 10 min. The sample was cooled to room temperature with an oven. The next day, the sample was heated from 423 to 523 K in increments of 25 K, after that it was cooled with the oven to room temperature. At 293 K, the XRD pattern was recorded the next day (after 15 h) after heating, after 7 days, and after 21 days.
