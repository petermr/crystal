<p>As approaching to the interface, the spatial translational and rotational symmetries of ions in the solution may be broken partially. To characterize these effects, four angles (α, β, γ, and φ), which have been marked in 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>, are defined based on two unit vectors (
 <italic>
  <bold>n</bold>
 </italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>
  <bold>n</bold>
 </italic>
 <sub>2</sub>). 
 <italic>
  <bold>n</bold>
 </italic>
 <sub>1</sub> is the unit vector from the central ion to oxygen atoms, and 
 <italic>
  <bold>n</bold>
 </italic>
 <sub>2</sub> is the unit vector along the dipole of a water molecule. α, β, and γ were defined as the angle between 
 <italic>
  <bold>n</bold>
 </italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and three axes (
 <italic>
  <bold>x</bold>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>
  <bold>y</bold>
 </italic>, and 
 <italic>
  <bold>z</bold>
 </italic>), respectively. φ is the angle between 
 <bold>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </bold>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <bold>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </bold>
 <sub>2</sub>. The distribution of α, β, γ, and φ was calculated as follows

  <graphic xlink:href="ao9b02620_m002" position="anchor" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>z</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> are the positions of the 
 <italic>i</italic>th bin and the number of ions in this bin, respectively. 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>θ</sub>(cos(θ)) denotes the number of water molecules, whose cos(α) (or cos β), cos(γ), and cos(φ) equal cos(θ). It needs to be pointed out that, due to the symmetry of the current system, the distribution of cos(β) is the same as that of cos(α).
