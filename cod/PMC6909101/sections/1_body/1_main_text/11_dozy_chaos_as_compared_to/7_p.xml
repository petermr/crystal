 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], and quantum chaos becomes a classical chaos when the transition from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics occurs. (Note that in this case of elementary chemical processes with quantum chaos, no clear explanations for or comparisons with the experiment were discussed.) In other words, quantum chaos in quantum mechanics is some analog of classical chaos in classical mechanics. In contrast, there is no analogue of dozy chaos, which is associated with the specific property of an electron to provoke chaos in the vibrations of nuclei, in classical mechanics. In other words, dozy chaos is a “purely quantum” phenomenon related to the specific property of a dynamically active electron in a molecule. We also note that the emergence of quantum and/or classical chaos is associated, as is well-known, with some nonlinear interactions in physical systems, whereas the emergence of dozy chaos occurs in a system with a linear interaction. More detailed comparisons between dozy chaos and quantum chaos will be given elsewhere.
