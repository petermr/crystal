 </xref> displays toluene dispersions of the NCs under white light and 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light. Their color under white light changed with changing iodide composition. The apparent color might be affected by the efficiency of their PL as well as their light absorption. The PL color under UV light changed from bluish-green to red with increasing iodide composition.

 </xref>A shows the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of the NC dispersions. The absorption edge red-shifted as the iodide composition increased.

 </sup> The value of

 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>. This is explained by the change in the band gap of the NCs as a result of the changing halide composition. According to the band structure of cubic CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub>, a change in the band gap is mainly caused by a shift of the valence band maximum, which is primarily composed of the p-orbitals of the halides.
