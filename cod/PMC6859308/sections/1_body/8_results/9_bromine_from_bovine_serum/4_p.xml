<p>For 9 BrQ-free cells 
 <italic>O</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Br,Hz</italic>
 </sub> varied between −0.2 and 0.2, the olive-colored dots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>. In the cell shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, where the overlap is obvious to the eye, the overlap parameter came out to be 
 <italic>O</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Br,Hz</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 1. This is recorded in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref> by 2 red dots marked “
 <italic>C</italic>” belonging to the 2 parasites residing in this doubly invaded cell. Therefore, the figure shows quantitatively that, although not always as visible as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, there is indeed overlap between Br signal and Hz crystals in BrQ-treated cells, while no such overlap occurs in the BrQ-free samples.
