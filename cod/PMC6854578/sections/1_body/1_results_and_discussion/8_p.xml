<p>The discussion above implies that the water molecules have certain ordering in the FHS. This kind of order is also closely related to the local coordination environment of ions.

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref> presents the distribution of cos(α) and cos(γ) in the FHS for Na
 <sup>+</sup> (a and b) and Cl
 <sup>–</sup> (c and d) in the first layer. The distribution of cos(α) and cos(γ) is similar for type I and type II Na
 <sup>+</sup>. The peak of type II Na
 <sup>+</sup> at cos(α)=0 is sharper than that of type I, and the distribution of cos(γ) for type II just slightly shifts to the right relative to that of type I. However, coordinating with/without Na
 <sup>+</sup> has a significant effect on the orientation of water molecules in the FHS of Cl
 <sup>–</sup>. The distribution of both cos(α) and cos(γ) for type I Cl
 <sup>–</sup> has more and sharper peaks than those for type II Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, which indicates that the water around type I Cl
 <sup>–</sup> is more ordered.
