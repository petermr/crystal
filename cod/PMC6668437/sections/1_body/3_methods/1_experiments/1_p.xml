<p id="Par25">High-quality single crystals were grown using a Bi rich melt in the ratios YbMnBi10 and EuMnBi10. The elements were heated to 1000 °C and cooled to 400 °C at 0.1 C/min, then subsequently centrifuged to remove excess Bi. The crystals exposed mirror-like portions of the surface after the cleave in ultra-high vacuum breaking z-periodicity. The structures of the compounds were solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Table
