<p>This study investigated the transverse thermoelectric properties of fibrous composites with anisotropic component materials. A mathematical model was built for predicting the transverse thermoelectric figure of merit (Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T) and maximum cooling capacity (∆T
 <sub>max</sub>) of the composite. The effectiveness of the mathematical model was verified by finite element simulations. The agreement among the two approaches indicated that the mathematical model can serve as an efficient tool for selecting and screening prospecting candidates for fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites with anisotropic material components. A case study using anisotropic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> polycrystal as the matrix and isotropic Copper as the fiber was performed and a ∆T
 <sub>max</sub> of 34 K was reached.
