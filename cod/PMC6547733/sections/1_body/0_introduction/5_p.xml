<p id="Par6">In this study, we report 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics simulations that focus on determining how the transition temperature from crystalline to amorphous phase is affected by the structure, composition and electronic excitation concentration in lanthanum-based compounds. In that regard, La
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> and La
 <sub>2</sub>Zr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> are ideal materials to investigate since they respectively occur in monoclinic layered perovskite and cubic pyrochlore structures. Therefore, mixing the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site cation modifies not only the composition of the material, but also its structure. In this study we also consider intermediate monoclinic La
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>2−x</sub>Zr
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> and cubic La
 <sub>2</sub>Zr
 <sub>2−x</sub>Ti
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> compounds to follow the evolution of the amorphization temperature as function of the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition. We find that differences in the octahedral connectivity of the cubic and monoclinic phases significantly influence the potential for defect generation and relative phase stability, with important implications for the design of nuclear energy systems.
