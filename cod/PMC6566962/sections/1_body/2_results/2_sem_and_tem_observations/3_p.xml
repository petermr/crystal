 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(i–l)</xref>) indicates, however, that these superlattice diffraction spots are 
 <italic>not located exactly at these mid positions</italic>, but rather split into two or more spots along the 
 <italic>c</italic>* direction (as shown in the enlarged patterns in the bottom left of 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). The split distance of these superlattice diffraction spots at the mid position between the 000 and the 002 fundamental spots (2
 <italic>Δ</italic>*) is twice that between the 000 and the 021 fundamental spots (
 <italic>Δ</italic>*). The split distance, 2
 <italic>Δ</italic>*, is approximately 1/15 and 1/19 the distances between the 000 and 002 fundamental spots (2
 <italic>c</italic>*) for the Al-30.0 and 31.0 at.%Fe alloys, respectively. As will be described in the following sections, the splitting of these superlattice reflections is due to structural/compositional modulation in the superlattice structure of the η″ phase. Specifically, the observed split distances indicate that the magnitude of the superlattice unit cell dimension of the η″ phase is respectively 15 and 19 times that of the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis of the parent orthorhombic unit cell of the η phase (0.42 184 nm). The spacing of the lattice fringes parallel to the (001)
 <italic>
  <sub>Cmcm</sub>
 </italic> plane (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(e–h)</xref>) is indeed fairly comparable to the magnitude of the superlattice periodicity (6.3 and 8.0 nm respectively for the Al-30.0 and 31.0 at.%Fe alloys) estimated from the split distance of the superlattice diffraction spots.
