<p id="Par10">Due to the limitations of X-ray diffraction, the ordering of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms could not be determined with absolute certainty. However, the obtained residuals and figures of merit were much better using this approach. With a ratio of O/N equals 1/1, this model is in good agreement with the elemental analysis data (see next chapter). Additionally, one has to keep in mind that the absence of the described ordering would lead to a variety of different local coordination environments for the europium cations, which would in turn cause a definitely broader emission band. To confirm the above mentioned ordering MAPLE (Madelung part of lattice energy) calculations have been performed. The results of these calculations are in good agreement with the other data and the oxygen/nitrogen-ordering is therefore a reasonable assumption. For the future, an in-depth analysis of the oxygen/nitrogen ordering via neutron diffraction could be employed.</p>
