 <caption>
  <p>Conventional (diffraction contrast) transmission electron microscopy image of the area containing the lamella in the focus ion beam section, which location of extraction is shown in Figure 
   <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. (a) Bright field image showing the lamella between two olivine grains and next to two wadsleyite grains. This area is mapped at the bottom of Figure 
   <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The small hole results from the ion thinning process. Several cracks are visible which probably result from decompression and/or specimen thinning. (b) Weak‐beam dark‐field image (
   <bold>g</bold> = 004 for olivine and 
   <bold>g</bold> = 400 for anhydrous phase B) showing that the lamella and the olivine 2 grain are in topotactic relationship and exhibit a network of misfit dislocations at the interface. (c) Bright‐field image from the “olivine 2” grain showing one of the thin lamellae observed within this grain.
