 </xref>a. The SD1 alignment layer transfers a torque to the LC molecules and aligns them in a direction parallel to the easy axis of the SD1.[qv: 35a,38] Simultaneously, due to the repulsive intermolecular forces between the QR ligands and LC molecules, which exert counter‐torque on QRs, QRs are aligned perpendicular to the easy axis of the SD1. The QR ligands, to minimize the total energy of the system, try to fit in the monomer matrix like a comb. This provides a long‐range order to the QRs.[qv: 35b] The order parameter of the resulting QR‐based composite films calculated from the TEM images could be as high as 0.87.[qv: 35b] Examples of such QR enhancement films (QREFs) are shown in Figure
