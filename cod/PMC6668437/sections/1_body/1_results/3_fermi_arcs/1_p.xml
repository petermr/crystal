<p id="Par17">As is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, the Weyl points from the first set are projected to the surface BZ (dashed circles) such that they annihilate. The Weyl points from the second set, in contrast, should be connected by peculiar surface states (the Fermi arc), when measuring the 001 surface, as in our experiment. In order to detect the possible fine structure and elusive arc of surface states, we have used lower photon energies to increase momentum resolution. The high-precision Fermi surface map is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. In the lower part of the map we overlay the experimental intensity with guides to eye to explain the observed features. There are clearly more features than one could previously conclude from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and simplified calculations presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. While one can still identify the elements of the calculated FS—hole-like lenses and electron-like pockets close to the X-points, they appear connected and in the region of the “lens” one can clearly identify three features instead of two. If the connection between the lenses and electron-like pockets, as was shown earlier, is due to the lifting of the spin-degeneracy, the third feature on the map is the Fermi surface arc which connects two previously detected Weyl points. The data shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref> confirm this assignment. Indeed, there are three Dirac-like dispersions corresponding to each “lens”. These two datasets are taken using different photon energy in an attempt to distinguish the bulk from the surface component. One can notice that in panel b two internal lines are less intense than the external ones, and in panel c the most inner ones are weaker than four others. On the basis of this observation and analysis of many other similar datasets we arrived at the conclusion that it is innermost linear dispersion corresponds to the Weyl arc. This is supported by the data taken from EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>. We present enlarged fragments of panels b and c together with similar cuts taken from different sample in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. The third feature is clearly present in all datasets. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> the high-precision Fermi surface map is zoomed into the single lens. Not only is the arc remarkably absent, but also the shape and intensity distribution of the ARPES intensity helps us to identify the bulk component in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>. The bulk lens has a very strong straight section and corners. Exactly the same characteristics are peculiar to the outer dispersions in the discussed earlier panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. As expected, the energy-momentum cut in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> contains only four dispersions, i.e., no signature of Weyl arc.
