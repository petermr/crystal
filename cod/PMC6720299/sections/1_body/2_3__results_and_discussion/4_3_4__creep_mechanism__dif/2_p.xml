<p>Besides this, during the creep process, the amorphous volume fraction gradually increases with time, and the amorphous structure is favorable for atomic diffusion. On the other hand, a decrease of grain size indicates an increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries in the model, and the atoms located at the grain boundaries exhibit rapid diffusion [
