 <p id="Par2">Generation of light with desirable amplitude and phase profiles with nonlinear wavefront shaping is of great interest for optical technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate efficient nonlinear beam shaping using three-dimensional lithium niobate photonic crystals fabricated using a femtosecond-laser-engineering technique.</p>
