 <p id="Par1">We investigate the oxygen conduction mechanism in a garnet-type oxide, Ca
  <sub>3</sub>Fe
  <sub>2</sub>Ge
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>12</sub>, for the first time in detail by first-principle calculations. The nudged elastic band results confirm that this oxide has a lower migration barrier energy (0.45 eV) for an oxygen interstitial (O
  <sub>
   <italic>i</italic>
  </sub>) with the kick-out mechanism than that (0.76 eV) for an oxygen vacancy. The migration paths for O
  <sub>
   <italic>i</italic>
  </sub> are delocalized and connected to the neighboring cells in three-dimensional space. This oxide does not have a very low formation energy of O
  <sub>
   <italic>i</italic>
  </sub> when the Fermi level is near the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital at a high temperature, which implies the possibility of electron doping by high-valence cations. These theoretical results suggest that the doping of Ca
  <sub>3</sub>Fe
  <sub>2</sub>Ge
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>12</sub> for generation of excess O
  <sub>
   <italic>i</italic>
  </sub> provides a good oxygen-ion conductivity, along with the electronic conductivity.
