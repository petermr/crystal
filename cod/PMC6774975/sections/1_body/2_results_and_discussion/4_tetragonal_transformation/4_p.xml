<p>For Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F7">figure 7</xref>, the tetragonal distortion can still decrease the total energy and may lead to the phase transformation. Through the 95% to 105% volume variation, the tetragonal XA structure always has the minimum energy value, indicating the presence of only the tetragonal structural distortion and no atom site reordering occurs, which is different from the case of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi. However, by observing the energy difference trend at different volume percentages, the minimum total energies under tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> and XA structures are getting close to each other at smaller volume, meaning the similar stability of these two structures. In combination, it is found the tetragonal structural distortion can decrease the total energy of cubic Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in either L2
 <sub>1</sub> or XA structure and possibly lead to phase transformation. The origin of these tetragonal ground states of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi has been theoretically explained by the decreasing effect of the density of states at the Fermi energy level [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the same time, atom site reordering may occur in this process dependent on the cell volume variation.
