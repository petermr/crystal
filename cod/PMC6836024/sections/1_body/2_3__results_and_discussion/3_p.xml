 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-01375">Figure S2</xref>). In the course of these studies, it was found that emission intensity of each V ion is quenched by temperature; however, their luminescence thermal quenching rates differ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f003">Figure 3</xref>b–d). In the case of V
 <sup>5+</sup>, emission intensity is gradually quenched by almost two orders of magnitude with temperature. However, correlation between Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> introduction and temperature of thermal quenching was not observed. This effect is understandable, since, as has been shown before, V
 <sup>5+</sup> occupy mainly surface part of the nanoparticles. In turn, the emission intensity of V
 <sup>4+</sup> initially decreases with temperature and above some critical temperature, it significantly increases as the temperature grows, which results from the efficient V
 <sup>5+</sup> → V
 <sup>4+</sup> energy transfer. It was found that the threshold temperature above which rise up of intensity was observed lowers with Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration (from around 10 °C for Y
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>4</sub>GaO
 <sub>12</sub> to −100 °C for Y
 <sub>3</sub>AlGa
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> and YGG). Additionally the magnitude of the intensity increase growths with Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> content. This phenomenon can be explained by the increase of the V
 <sup>5+</sup> → V
 <sup>4+</sup> energy transfer probability. Higher numbers of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> sites in the structures promote the stabilization of the V
 <sup>4+</sup> ions, which, as a consequence, shortens the average distance between V
 <sup>5+</sup> and V
 <sup>4+</sup> facilitating interionic interactions. Due to the fact that energy of V
 <sup>5+</sup> excited state is higher than that of V
 <sup>4+</sup>, the energy transfer between them occurs with the assistance of the phonon. According to the Miyakava-Dexter theory, the probability of this process is strongly dependent on temperature, which is in agreement with our data [
 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It needs to be noted that although V
 <sup>5+</sup> ions serve as a sensitizers for V
 <sup>4+</sup>, there is no correlation between Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration and the V
 <sup>5+</sup> luminescence thermal quenching. This comes from the fact that in the case of V
 <sup>5+</sup> intensity the luminescence thermal quenching process plays dominant role over V
 <sup>5+</sup> → V
 <sup>4+</sup> energy transfer. The correlation between Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration and the luminescent thermal quenching rate is also evident in the case of V
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. The higher the amount of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>, the lower the thermal quenching rate of the 
 <sup>1</sup>E
 <sub>2</sub> → 
 <sup>3</sup>T
 <sub>1g</sub> emission band. Above 100 °C, the V
 <sup>4+</sup> emission intensity becomes so efficient that its intensity dominates over the V
 <sup>3+</sup> ones and thus hinders its emission intensity analysis. In the case of YGG, the V
 <sup>3+</sup> emission is impossible to detect.
