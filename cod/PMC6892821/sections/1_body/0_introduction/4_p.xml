<p id="Par5">Following this strategy, here we present a first step in this direction. In 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations based on DFT and MBPT, we focus on the ideal face-centred-cubic (FCC) phases of Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb, Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb, and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb, and investigate their electronic structure in the valence and core region. Experimentally, QE measurements coupled with XPS are used to determine correlations between the growth procedure, the material properties, and the photocathode characteristics, including their composition, stoichiometry, and oxydation state

The analysis of core states enabled by the adopted all-electron DFT formalism provides all the ingredients for a qualitative comparison with the collected XPS data on the grown photocathodes in view of new, cost efficient strategies to predict and characterise advanced electron source materials.
