<p>Hydrogen frequently plays a key role in molecular compounds and other compounds like minerals as a result of the natural inclusion of water. Owing to its low atomic number, it is very difficult to find hydrogen by traditional X-ray crystallography and thus neutrons have made a large contribution to locating hydrogen in crystal structures. Although single-crystal neutron diffraction has been the dominant technique for this purpose, with the high intensity and resolution afforded by modern powder diffractometers like POWGEN, one can also extract this information from neutron powder diffraction (NPD), particularly in cases where single crystals of sufficient size cannot be made.</p>
