 <italic>Transient absorption experiment</italic> was conducted with a 45 fs, 4 mJ, 800 nm Coherent Libra with a 1 kHz repetition rate. Single-frequency 400 nm pump pulses were generated by the second harmonic generation through a barium borate crystal. The remaining 800 nm component was filtered by two 400 nm dielectric mirrors. The pulse energies were controlled by a neutral density filter. Continuum probe pulses were generated in a sapphire window and relayed to the sample with reflective optics. The spot size of the probe was adjusted to match the 200 μm spot size of the pump. Signal detection was accomplished with a high-speed complementary metal-oxide semiconductor array detector that is synchronized to the laser system.
