 <caption> Relative total energies of geometrically optimized supercells with respect to the most stable supercell. The horizontal axis (FFID) is the permutation number which is identical to the rank determined by FF calculations (blue circles). The relative total energies per atom determined by DFT calculations (orange diamonds) are expressed relative to the total energy of the supercell which according to the DFT calculations is most stable (#1). </caption>
