<p>Because the photopolymerization of the acrylic system is easier to control compared to the epoxy system, we employed the photopolymerization process using an aliphatic acrylic acrylate oligomer and an acrylic monomer to prepare red and green QDs involving the aliphatic polymer film in this study, avoiding yellowing of the polymer matrix. In this work, we directly dispersed tri-
 <italic>n</italic>-octylphosphine (TOP)-capped CdSe/ZnS QDs into an acrylic acrylate oligomer using the solution mixing method, followed by solvent removal, and then coating this mixture on a blue LED chip and curing by UV light to achieve a QDâ€“acrylate hybrid LED device. In addition, we report the optical, morphological, topological, and thermal properties of UV-cured acrylate resin-CdSe/ZnS QD nanocomposites in this work. These fluorescent nanocomposites consisted of a small number of quantum dots exhibiting optical features and thermal stability, so these processes and materials are worth promoting in LED applications.
