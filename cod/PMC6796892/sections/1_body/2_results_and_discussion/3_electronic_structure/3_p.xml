<p>The band structures for both the para- and ferroelectric phases of

 <bold>k</bold>-path considered in the band structure is shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01176/suppl_file/ao9b01176_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4</ext-link> in the Supporting Information. The lowest bands seen around 9 eV below the 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub> are due to the Pb 6s states. It is to be noted that these bands are broader in the paraelectric phase, whereas in the ferroelectric phase, they are more localized in a small energy range. This explains the effect of 6s lone pair in stabilizing the ferroelectric state. A manifold of occupied O 2p bands are spread over a range of −7 to −2 eV. A pair of bands separated from O 2p bands are localized just below 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub>. These are having V 3d character with no dispersion along Γ–
 <italic>Z</italic> direction and a very weak dispersion along 
 <italic>X</italic>–
 <italic>R</italic> as well as 
 <italic>M</italic>–
 <italic>A</italic> directions indicating a 2D characteristic in the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane.

 </sup> Above these band features, a narrow gap with the value of 0.2 eV is present in the ferroelectric phase. The conduction bands located in the vicinity of CB edge are derived from V 3d states, but the bands at higher energy (∼3 eV) have mainly Pb 6p character. We have also calculated the band structure with the GGA + 
 <italic>U</italic> method. The GGA + 
 <italic>U</italic> band structures for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 and 1 compositions are given in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01176/suppl_file/ao9b01176_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figures S5 and S6</ext-link> in the Supporting Information. It can be seen that when the V concentration is low, the vanadyl bond weakens and therefore the d
 <sub>
  <italic>xy</italic>
 </sub> band gets dispersed along the Γ–
 <italic>Z</italic>, 
 <italic>X</italic>–
 <italic>R</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic>–
 <italic>A</italic> directions. This indicates that the tendency of the system to form the 2D magnetism is reduced for lower 
 <italic>x</italic> values.
