 </sup>. Knowledge on physical and chemical properties of the melts is important for understanding evolution of the deep Earth interiors. The local structure of melts, which is roughly characterized by the coordination number of silicon atoms and the way how the silicon polyhedra are interconnected at certain pressure–temperature conditions, can be modeled using molecular dynamics simulations

 </sup> to 7. However, structural models are lacking and the interpretation of observations remains ambiguous, as the existence of penta-coordinated silicon in glass remains elusive. A very convincing method to obtain a structural model of noncrystalline silica material is to compare (or fit) experimental total scattering data with the pair-distribution function (PDF) of known crystalline phase(s)

 </sup>. In this manner, Keen and Dove

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> determined that the local structure of silica glass at ambient conditions has strong similarities with HP-tridymite and β-cristobalite. So far, however, there were no crystalline phase(s) which could describe features of total scattering data of silica and/or silicate glasses at high pressure.
