<p>The Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si phase had the highest values of bulk, shear and Youngâ€™s moduli of all the intermetallics, and the Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al had the lowest. The sequence was the same for all the moduli; they decreased from Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si, to Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al, to Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si, to Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al. It can be seen that all the moduli were significantly higher when Nb was the transition metal in the ternary phase. Furthermore, the Si-containing phases had slightly higher values of bulk, shear and elastic moduli than those that contained Al.
