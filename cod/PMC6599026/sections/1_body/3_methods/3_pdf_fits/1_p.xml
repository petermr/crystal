<p id="Par14">Refinements of structural models including simulation of termination ripples were performed with the PDFgui software
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. A fit to the CeO
 <sub>2</sub> PDF with a fixed structural model was used to extract the instrument-sensitive parameters 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>damp</sub> = 0.0475(4) Å
 <sup>−1</sup> and 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>broad</sub> = 0.0186(3) Å
 <sup>−1</sup>. It was not possible to minimise the value of 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>V</sub> directly in the refinements and so the best-fit value was found by comparing 
 <italic>R</italic>ws for the seven structural models with varying fixed 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>V</sub> values.
