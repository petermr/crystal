<p>According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the applied pressure narrows the bandgap significantly, and the bandgap closes under 10 GPa. The bandgap remains at zero as the pressure increases above 10 GPa, comparable with previous research [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This indicates that the pressure induces the transition from a semiconductor to a metal in GeSe. It is noteworthy that the metallization occurring at 10 GPa does not give rise to symmetry changes. A similar phenomenon appears in the homologous compounds [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It should be noted that, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the bandgap below 2 GPa falls more dramatically than that above 2 GPa, which is in accordance with the relationship between the lattice constant and the pressure.
