<p id="Par26">Raman experiments were performed to 25.2 GPa using a symmetric screw-driven diamond-anvil cell equipped with ultra low-fluorescence diamonds of 200 μm culet diameter. A rhenium gasket was used to hold the sample, with a chamber of about 75 μm diameter and 30 μm thick. A Tilleyite powder sample was loaded in the chamber together with a ruby chip whose fluorescence is used as pressure calibrant. Argon gas was loaded into diamond anvil cells at a pressure of 0.2 GPa to be used as pressure transmitting medium. High-quality Raman spectra were acquired using a custom-built micro-focused Raman system, using a 514 nm laser as the excitation line. Raman scattering radiation was collected in back-scattering configuration. The device is equipped with a 20x Mitutoyo long working distance objective and focused onto the slit of a Princeton monochromator with a grating of 1800 gr/mm and a CCD detector.

 </sup> Spectra were measured with a spectral resolution of about 1–2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and calibrated with a standard neon emission lamp. The typical sampling area was about 2 μm in diameter.
