<p>The results obtained in this work are an improvement over those previously published by other authors in similar conditions. The sample purity (96%), as well as the saturation magnetization (31 emu/g), is slightly higher than that found by other authors. However, we have not been able to obtain perfectly isolated nanoparticles, as they sinter during calcination. Moreover, the number distribution of the nanoparticles could not be obtained in detail for each sample due to resolution limitations.</p>
