 <title>Significance</title>
 <p>We uncover the presence of a new topological crystalline insulator (TCI) state in bismuth, which is protected by a twofold rotational symmetry. In contrast to the recently discovered higher-order topological phase in bismuth, the present TCI phase hosts unpinned Dirac cone surface states that could be accessed directly through photoemission experiments. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the rich topological electronic structure of bismuth.</p>
