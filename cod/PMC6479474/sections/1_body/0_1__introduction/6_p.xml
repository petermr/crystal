<p>The purpose and novelty of the present study is to explore NIR vs. IR spectra correspondences in crystalline melamine. To achieve this, for the first time, we employ anharmonic quantum mechanical calculations of NIR spectra of melamine, by using two different approaches, which we directly compare. Moreover, we improve the previous investigations of IR spectra in a well-defined crystalline lattice by employing an infinite three-dimensional (3D) periodic model of the crystalline melamine, for the first time as well. This yields more accurate calculated IR spectrum, but it also is essential in obtaining good comprehension of a number of relevant effects. In example, the impact of anharmonicity may become well separated from the influence of the chemical neighborhood. The distinct difference in the importance of inter-molecular interactions for the accurate reproduction of IR and NIR transitions of melamine is found and explained. This means that, in contrast to IR bands, the accurate reproduction of NIR bands requires significantly less attention in describing the long-range, and in particular, inter-plane, interactions in crystalline melamine.</p>
