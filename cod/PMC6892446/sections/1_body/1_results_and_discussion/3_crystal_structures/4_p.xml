 <sub>2</sub>Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> differs in the linking of the tetrahedra within the layers (six‐membered rings), the structure of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> has the same net of four‐ and eight‐membered rings as the here presented compounds, yet the folding is much less pronounced, which entails the absence of trenches. Two other related compounds are H

 <sup>4+</sup> (26 pm) as compared to Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> (49 pm, c.n.=4).
