<p>In the present work, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the mineral composition of montmorillonite. XRD was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation, manufactured by RicoKu Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) The diffraction angle of the patterns was recorded from 3° to 70° with a scanning speed of 5°/min. The elemental quantitative analysis of the purified montmorillonite was carried out using the Axios advanced X-ray fluorescence spectrometer manufactured by PANalyticalB.V. (Almelo, Netherlands). The samples used for XRF analysis were made by casting.</p>
