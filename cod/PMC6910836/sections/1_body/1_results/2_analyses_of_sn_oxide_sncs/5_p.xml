<p>The positions of the Raman peak maxima and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the undefined peaks are plotted as functions of the constituent atomicity in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>, respectively. A red shift and broadening of the peak with decreasing SNC size are apparent, indicating that the cluster size, even at the subnanoscale, affects the spectral properties sensitively.
