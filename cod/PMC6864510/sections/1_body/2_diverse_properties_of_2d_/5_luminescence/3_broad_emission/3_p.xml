<p>To date, 12 organic cations have been used to synthesize corrugated 2D perovskites with such a broad white light emission.[qv: 11,18c,28,109,111] The mechanism of this broadband luminescence is believed to be from the “self‐trapping states.” Karunadasa's group first reported the white light emission from three 2D perovskites: (110) perovskites of (

From the temperature‐dependent emission spectrum, when the temperature decreases from 300 to 150 K, the shoulder intensity becomes weaker and the FWHM is narrower.
