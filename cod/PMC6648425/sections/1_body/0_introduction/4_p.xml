 </sup> Although solid-oxide fuel cells have advantages such as high efficiency, fast reaction kinetics, fuel flexibility, and low emission of pollutants, their high operating temperature causes issues of degradation of cell materials, need for high-temperature-tolerant materials, and delay in start-up time.

 </sup> Therefore, huge efforts have been made recently to develop an intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells, and a comprehensive understanding of oxygen diffusion in the candidate oxide such as PrBaCo
