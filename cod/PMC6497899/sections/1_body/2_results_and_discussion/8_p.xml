<p id="Par43">Nowadays, perovskite heterojunctions have been adopted to improve the physical properties of perovskite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Usually, these heterojunctions can integrate the merits of both materials, such as perovskite-polymer bulk heterostructure, perovskite-PbS core-shell structure, and perovskite-plasmonic Au or Ag composite material [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], which can enhance efficiency. However, due to the poor stability of perovskite, it is difficult to design and fabricate heterojunction. Besides, these perovskite heterojunctions may be not stable compared to pure perovskite.
