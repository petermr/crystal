<p>Having proven the existence of the superstructure in Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn, we proceed to understand the systematic vacancy formation in the crystal and atomic environment around different types of atoms. As stated before, the crystal structure of Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn can be described as a superstructure of the inverse tetragonal Heusler structure (Mn
 <sub>2</sub>PtSn) with ordered Mn-vacancies. This structure is obtained by doubling the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis, forced by an ordered arrangement of vacancies in the Pt–Mn substructure of the inverse Heusler Mn
 <sub>2</sub>PtSn (

 </xref>). The created vacancies, starting from Mn
 <sub>2</sub>PtSn, are equally distributed in Pt–Mn layers (for Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn: Pt–(0.4Mn/0.6□)), which are alternately stacked with Mn–Sn layers along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. Here, □ is the placeholder for a vacancy. In each Pt–(Mn/□) layer, the vacancies are arranged in such a way that they are at maximal distances from each other. In

 </xref>, we show the atomic environments as coordination shells of Mn1, Mn2, Pt, Sn, and □ individually for both Mn
 <sub>2</sub>PtSn and Mn
 <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn in the asymmetric part of the unit cell. There is no vacancy in the atomic environment of Mn1, two in the first coordination shell of Mn2, three in the shell of Pt, and two in the shell of Sn. The coordination shell of □ does not contain any vacancy.
