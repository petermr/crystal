  <p>Results of SFS illustrated by pair-plots of features under conditions (
   <bold>a</bold>) 
   <italic>N</italic> = 4 with four features, (
   <bold>b</bold>) 
   <italic>N</italic> = 8 with two features, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) 
   <italic>N</italic> = 12 with one feature. The blue and yellow dots represent particles in smectic- and nematic-like trajectories, respectively. For 
   <italic>N</italic> = 4, the data for all pair-plots slightly overlap, indicating that one or two features cannot completely distinguish between the nematic- and smectic-like structures. For 
   <italic>N</italic> = 8, the data for the pair-plots almost separate into two regions, suggesting good performance by the combination of two features. In contrast, the data for one feature are slightly overlapped. For 
   <italic>N</italic> = 12, the data for the one feature are completely separated into two fields. The definitions of the order parameters
