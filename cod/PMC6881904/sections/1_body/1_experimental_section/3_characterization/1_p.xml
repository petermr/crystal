<p>Phase identification of all the as-obtained phosphor samples were performed on a Siemens D500 X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD patterns were collected with a resolution of 0.018°/step and 2 s/step in a 2θ range of 10°–60°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the respective powder samples were taken by means of the Carl Zeiss Sigma field emission SEM (Carl Zeiss, Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., Peabody, MA) using the secondary electron detector and operating at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV with a working distance of 8.8 mm.
