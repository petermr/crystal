<p>In the next two sections, we will describe the results of crystal structure refinement for the η″ phase in two steps: first determination of the motif structure without structural/compositional modulation (
 <xref rid="S0003-S2002">Section 3.2</xref>) and then determination of the long-period unit cell structure with structural/compositional modulation (
 <xref rid="S0003-S2003">Section 3.3</xref>).
