<p>At ZnO(101[combining macron]0), the calculated diffusion coefficient along the nonpolar direction [12[combining macron]10], 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="c8sc03033b-t2.jpg" id="ugt2" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>, is 20 times greater than the diffusion coefficient along the polar direction [0001], 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="c8sc03033b-t3.jpg" id="ugt3" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>. Here, we note that the latter value is quite uncertain because of the small number of solvent-assisted PT events which contribute to PHC diffusion along [0001] (the small number of such events does not give rise to a “noisy” MSD, since the MSD is averaged over all PHCs); in fact, the biggest contribution to the calculated mean squared displacement along [0001], even for a correlation time of 25 ns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref>), comes from individual surface-PT events, which do not contribute to PHC diffusion (see also Discussion). The calculated
