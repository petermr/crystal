<p>TEM observations were carried out using a FEI® Tecnai G2‐20 twin microscope operating at 200 kV and a Philips CM30 microscope operating at 300 kV, both equipped with a LaB
 <sub>6</sub> filament and using a double tilt sample‐holder. Automated crystal orientation mapping in TEM (ACOM‐TEM) was operated in the TEM with the ASTAR
 <sup>TM</sup> tool from NanoMEGAS. As on SEM images, one can observe within and at the limits of olivine crystals irregularly shaped grains, which are indexed with ACOM‐TEM as wadsleyite, and a planar lamella located at the boundary between two olivine grains (Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). With ACOM‐TEM, the lamella can be indexed neither as olivine nor as wadsleyite.
