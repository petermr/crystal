 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f007">Figure 7</xref>bâ€“d show, for each of the ABs considered, (i) the three longitudinal sections with the starting (black line) and modified (red line) sand profiles, (ii) section 0.26 indicating the clearing (pink color) and embankment (blue color) of the sand, and finally, (iii) a detail of this last section. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f007">Figure 7</xref>, you can also see qualitatively the variation in the sand distribution in the front and behind each of the tested ABs, providing a clear picture of their permeability behavior.
