 </sup> on quartz glass substrates (25.4 mm × 25.4 mm × 2 mm) using a custom-designed high-throughput combinatorial ion beam deposition system (HTC-IBD) at room temperature with a base vacuum pressure of 1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> torr. The ternary thin-film precursor consisted of a sequentially deposited stack of wedge-shaped layers, that were created by a mask moving linearly across the substrate during deposition. The coated area is triangular-shaped (20 mm in side length) with a total thickness of 80 nm across. The stack was divided into 8 cycles of 10 nm layer groups. Two different layer sequences were used: a three-layer sequence of Cu → Ni → Ti (sequence 1) and a four-layer sequence of Cu → Ti → Ni → Ti (sequence 2), as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. Then the as-deposited precursors were sealed in evacuated quartz glass tubes and placed in a vacuum oven for heat treatment. One of the key factors in the solid-state amorphization is to ensure the annealing temperature is lower than the formation temperature of intermediate compound. Therefore, a low annealing temperature (373 K) was selected so that the nucleation and growth of the crystalline phases were suppressed.
