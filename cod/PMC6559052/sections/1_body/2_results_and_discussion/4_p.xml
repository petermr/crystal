<p>Based on this best-fit model, adsorbate (O(1′)) molecules preferentially adsorb to surface Ti

 </sup> Removal of O(1′) from our model increases the χ
 <sup>2</sup> to 1.1 (i.e., 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>b), indicating that the quality of the fit is sensitive to the presence of this adsorbate. As mentioned above, there are two unresolved questions in the literature regarding this adsorbate-decorated surface in an aqueous environment: (i) whether adsorption is mixed or fully dissociated and (ii) if the surface coverage is full or half monolayer. With regard to issue (i), the chemical identity of O(1′) and thus confirmation of our best-fit model can be distinguished with SXRD by the length of the Ti–O(1′) bond.
