<p>Using an EAM potential, MD simulations have been carried out to study the effects of FCC copper textured surfaces with different depths, widths, orientations and shapes on friction behaviors during nanoscale sliding contacts. The influence of subsurface defects on the substrate is also discussed. Under the conditions and material used in this paper, some conclusions are drawn, as follows:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>(1)</label>
   <p>Compared with a smooth surface, textured surfaces can reduce friction forces effectively. In addition, the textured surfaces with a higher depth and smaller width lead to lower average friction forces.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(2)</label>
   <p>For the texture surfaces with the orientations of 0° and 90°, the average friction forces are higher than those with orientations of 30°, 45° and 60°, and the textured surface with 45° orientation produces the lowest average friction force.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(3)</label>
   <p>The effects of texture shape on friction behaviors are slight compared with the effects of depth, width and orientation, and the v-shape shows a lower average friction force.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(4)</label>
   <p>The nanoscale ball defects in the substrate make the sliding process unstable. In this paper, when the depth of the ball defects is 
    <italic>h</italic> = 3.615 nm, the influence of defects on the average friction force is the greatest. When the depth is greater than 3.615 nm, the average friction forces decrease with the increase in depth, and they tend to be close to that of a perfect substrate.
