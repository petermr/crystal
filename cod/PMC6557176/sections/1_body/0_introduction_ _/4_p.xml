<p>After the alignment process, the scattering information for the first azimuthal position is collected, followed by sample rotation around the surface normal and another image being taken [

Considering the different geometries, this is achievable either by a complex and time-consuming adjustment of various moveable parts (goniometer and motor positions) at each point or by proper design of the sample movements, as for example offered by the κ or Eulerian geometry, which directly allow sample rotation around the surface normal. The data quality improves further if the intensity is collected continuously during azimuthal rotation as opposed to a stepped scan, so that information, even though smeared because of integration, is fully collected.
