<p>Inspired by the idea of the bifurcation diagram but adopting an algorithmic approach, we analyzed the BCA covalent bonding pattern under ambient and high pressure using a connected component search algorithm

 </xref>). The algorithm performs a topological analysis of the DORI function based on 3-manifold decomposition theory and identifies its critical points (e.g., maxima and saddle point; see the details in the

A similar algorithm has recently been applied to study methane diffusion in nanoporous materials from a potential energy field.
