 <sub>9/2</sub> level of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> in CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor are calculated to be 327.58 μs (479 nm) and 336.74 μs (573 nm), and those in CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor are calculated to be 3.88 μs (479 nm) and 32.44 μs (573 nm); and the effective lifetime of 
 <sup>4</sup>G
 <sub>5/2</sub> level of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> in CLSO:0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor at 601 nm is found to be 697.07 μs and that in CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor is 22.89 μs. It can be obviously observed that the lifetimes of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> have a sharp decrease, considering that the distance between Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>, Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and Sm
 <sup>3+</sup>, Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> and Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> decreases with dopant concentration increasing, causing the probability of energy transfer to luminescent killer sites rising. The lifetime decrease of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> in co-doped phosphor owing to existing Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> → Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> non-radiative energy transfer because of the overlap between peak at 479 nm of emission spectra of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> and peak at 476 nm of excitation spectra of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup>, interestingly, the lifetime of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> also appear a sharp decline for the reason that there may exist Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> ↔ Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> bilateral non-radiative energy transfer, consistent with the second hypothesis mentioned above in spectra section.
