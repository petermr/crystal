<p id="Par15">In order to understand the presence of the FM domains, magnetism seen in the MH curves and the origin of the observed lifting of the degeneracy by ARPES (TRS breaking), we have carried out calculations considering several types of canted antiferromagnetism of the Mn atoms—both with in-plane and out-of-plane ferromagnetic components. Remarkably, in all cases the degeneracy was lifted in the way it is observed experimentally: the gap between the linear Dirac dispersions became smaller for one of the non-degenerate components and disappeared in several momentum points. In other words, canting resulted in splitting of the 3D-Dirac points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) into Weyl points and Weyl loops. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> we present the main results for the configuration of spins with the ferromagnetic component along ΓM direction (ΓM
 <sub>II</sub>). Two sets of Weyl points are observed in this case. The first one consists of four points with the coordinates (0.193, 0.193, 0.12), (−0.193, −0.193, 0.12), (0.194, 0.194, −0.09), and (−0.194, −0.194, −0.09) with the energy of 168 meV above the Fermi level. These points move toward the mentioned earlier 3D-Dirac points upon decreasing of the canting angle and annihilate in the case of perfect antiferromagentism (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Another set of Weyl points with coordinates (0.394, 0.045, 0.131), (0.394, −0.045, 0.131), (0.045, 0.394, 0.131), and (−0.045, −0.394, 0.131) with the energy of 40 meV below the Fermi level corresponds to the crossing of the non-degenerate bands observed experimentally in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. In the right panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> we show the band dispersions in the vicinity of one of these points. The key observation is that the Weyl “cones” are very anisotropic. If perpendicular to the Fermi surface in

 <sub>x</sub>
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> plane, the Fermi velocity is a record-breaking one (9 eVÅ), if along the Fermi surface or along 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>, it is more than two orders of magnitude smaller (~0.043 eVÅ). Apart from the mentioned Weyl points we found the loops of Weyl crossings around the ΓM
 <sub>⊥</sub> (these are analogous to the Dirac loop shown earlier in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, but doubly degenerate, not quarterly, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> on the ΓM
 <sub>⊥</sub> line) and very small gap regions above the second set of Weyl points close to the ZAR plane. Our band-structure calculations thus clearly point to the first realization of the Weyl state in a canted antiferromagnet (Supplementary Note
