<p>Crystals of the title compound were obtained by slow diffusion (three layers) in a 3 ml tube. The first layer contained 19 mg (0.05 mmol) of K
 <sub>2</sub>[Pt(CN)
 <sub>4</sub>] in 0.5 ml of water. The middle layer contained 1.5 ml of a water:acetone (1:1) solution. The third layer contained 25 mg (0.05 mmol) of Fe(OTs)
 <sub>2</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O in 0.4 ml of acetone and 0.1 ml of water. The colourless crystals grew in the middle layer within three weeks and were kept in the mother solution prior to measurements.
