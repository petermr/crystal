<p>Despite the undoubted progress in extracting structural information using AXCCA, there are a few aspects which can be addressed in future. First of all, similar to many other X-ray techniques, one of the limiting factors are X-ray detectors. For AXCCA, it is desirable to record the full scattering ring in order to perform the Fourier analysis of the angular anisotropy of the diffracted intensity. The smaller the length scales of the scattering objects, the larger are the X-ray scattering angles, which means that larger detectors are required to capture the whole scattering ring. Sometimes it is sufficient to record only a part of the scattering ring (see, for example, [

 <xref rid="B99-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]), but this usually requires some pre-existing knowledge about the structure of the system, so this approach cannot be used in general. Another possible improvement could be the development of faster detectors. The existing 2D detectors allow collecting a limited number of images with MHz frequency, however in a continuous regime the frame rate is limited by kHz. Increase of the frame rate would allow combining of AXCCA with XPCS type measurements to investigate the dynamics of various soft matter systems in the non-destructive regime.
