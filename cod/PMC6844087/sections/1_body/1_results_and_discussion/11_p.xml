<p>In all samples, most of the particles are in the nanometric range because the number distribution is centered under 100 nm. On the other hand, the major part of the volume of the sample is occupied by micrometer-sized particles. This double effect can be due to two different factors: (i) most of the particles are nanometric in size, but there are others (much lower in number) that are orders of magnitude bigger and have a greater influence when representing the volume fraction (it would happen in a synthesis process with an extremely low degree of control); (ii) nanoparticles have been formed, but then they get attached to each other by thermal processes (i.e., sintering) forming micrometric clusters. The shape of the volume distribution suggests that different distributions coexist in the sample. Therefore, the formation of clusters may be the origin of these micrometric bodies. Otherwise, a more continuous distribution should be expected if micrometric particles would have been formed. Moreover, as LD principles assume spherical particles, the different superposed peaks could also be originated by irregular-shaped particles, which is common in aggregates.</p>
