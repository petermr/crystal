 <sub>3</sub>·9H
 <sub>2</sub>O (≥98%), and Cr(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>·9H
 <sub>2</sub>O (99%) as raw materials (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich), we synthesized a series of Na

 <sup>3+</sup> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) phosphors by a hydrothermal reaction. In all cases, the percentages given for Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> dopant is in mol % with respect to the Al
 <sup>3+</sup> site. First, the specified stoichiometric Al(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>·9H
 <sub>2</sub>O and Cr(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>·9H
 <sub>2</sub>O were weighed and then dissolved by 30 mL of deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) under magnetic stirring in a glass beaker. Second, excess NaF and NH
 <sub>4</sub>F with &gt;9 times molar ratio to metal ions (Al
 <sup>3+</sup> and/or Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>) were measured and added into another 30 mL of DI water for dissolution. Third, the NaF and NH
 <sub>4</sub>F solution was transferred into the above Al(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> and Cr(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> solution for reaction, and then 10 mL of absolute ethanol was added additionally. At last, after vigorous stirring for about 30 min, the resultant white suspension was transferred into a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (Parr Instrument Company), filled up to 70% of its capacity, sealed tightly, and heated at 240 °C in an electrical furnace for 15 h. After being slowly cooled to room temperature, the filtered precipitate was centrifuged several times with DI water to remove any possible ionic remnant and finally dried at 80 °C for 24 h in an ambient atmosphere.
