<p>GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> cation exchange precursor was prepared in a N
 <sub>2</sub>-filled glovebox, by making a 1 mol/L (176.08 g/L) solution of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> in toluene, resulting in a transparent, bright green liquid. It was found that the solution degraded over time, even when stored under inert atmosphere. Degradation was indicated by a change of color from bright green to dark red. In all reactions with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> as precursor, a fresh batch of precursor was used.
