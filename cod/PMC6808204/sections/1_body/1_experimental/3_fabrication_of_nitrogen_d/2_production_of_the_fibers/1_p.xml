<p>At first, 3.0 g of PVP was mixed with 2.5 mL of ethanol and 2.5 mL of pure water in a glass vial. Then, 2.0 mL of the PVP solution was mixed with 15.0 ÂµL of the N-CDot dispersion for electrospinning. The PVP/N-CDot fibers were fabricated by employing a potential difference of 15 kV and a flow rate of 1 mL per hour as the operating conditions of the electrospinning process. Owing to the potential difference between the syringe tip and the collector aluminum foil, the N-CDots were confined into sub-micrometer fibers by electrospinning.</p>
