<p>2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites have received widespread attention as promising materials for optoelectronic devices especially in recent years, due to their unique properties of large exciton binding energy, strong quantum confinement effect, and stability. Here, we reviewed the state‐of‐the‐art 2D perovskites, with their synthesis methods for powders and thin films, including single‐crystal growth, colloidal synthesis, spin coating, and vapor‐phase deposition, and analyzed the possible growth kinetics, various properties in optoelectronic devices, and applications in LEDs and solar cells.</p>
