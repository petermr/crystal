 <caption>
  <p>Lead-free perovskite nanomaterials based down-conversion LEDs. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the synthesis of the 2D (OCTAm)
   <sub>2</sub>SnBr
   <sub>4</sub> by a facile aqueous acid-based synthetic method in ambient air. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Images of yellow phosphors, blue/green phosphors, and their blends with different ratios embedded in PS films under sunlight (top panel) and 365 nm UV light (bottom panel). The first row in each panel are a yellow–blue phosphor mixture, and the second is a yellow–blue–green mixture. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Chromaticity coordinates of different ratios of the phosphor mixture plotted on the CIE1931 chromaticity chart: Blue phosphor (square), yellow phosphor (round), yellow–blue phosphor 4:1 (triangle), and yellow–blue–green phosphor 4:1:1.5 (star). Reproduced with permission [

   <bold>d</bold>) Photograph of the colloidal suspension and film of (OAm)
   <sub>2</sub>SnBr
   <sub>4</sub> perovskites under UV light. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Normalized absorption (Abs), PL excitation (PLE, monitored at 620 nm), and PL (excited by 365 nm) spectra of the (OAm)
   <sub>2</sub>SnBr
   <sub>4</sub> perovskite film. Reproduced with permission [

   <bold>f</bold>) Absorption and photoluminescence spectra of CsBr:Eu
   <sup>2+</sup> NCs. The inset depicts the optical images of the NCs dispersed in hexane with and without illumination by a 365 nm UV lamp. (
