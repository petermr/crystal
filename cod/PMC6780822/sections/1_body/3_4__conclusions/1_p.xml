<p>The implemented YSZ nanoparticle material and planarization material endured, without deformation, the subsequent thermal annealing process at the temperature ranged to 580 °C. Highly efficient OLED devices can be manufactured using the conventional display manufacturing process by implementing YSZ nanoparticles. A 38% enhancement in luminance of the OLED device was achieved by the scattering layer with a thickness of 2.5 μm, compared to the device without the scattering layer. Moreover, the decreased angular color change was obtained by implementation of the nanoparticle scattering layer, where the white angular dependency (WAD) Δu’v’ was reduced to 0.005 at 60 degrees from normal direction. Thus, we believe that this study can provide a simple, practical, and low-cost method for improving the performance of OLED display products.</p>
