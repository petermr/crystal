<p id="Par19">From the analysis of the calculated stress in the nanoplate, it is found that the shear stress shows an apparent correlation to the deformation, which makes it distinct from other components of the stress tensor. Therefore, we consider the shear stress as the primary driven force of the bending deformation and present its distribution in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b. Clearly, the stress is no longer uniformly distributed owing to the short-range order induced by the emergence of those (110) facets. From the comparison of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> a and b, it is found that the stress distribution is highly correlated to the orientation arrangement of the facets. The stresses in the red facets shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a are generally positive, while they are negative in the blue ones. This observation suggests that the red and blue facets roughly tend to move towards the opposite directions. Significant stress gaps are observed to exist near the grain boundaries. These accumulated stresses are accompanied with the formation of (110) facets and would be released through further deformation of the nanoplate.
