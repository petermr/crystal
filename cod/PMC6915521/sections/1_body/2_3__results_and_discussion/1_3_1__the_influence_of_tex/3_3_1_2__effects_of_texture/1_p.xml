<p>At the atomic scale, adhesion effects play important roles in the friction force, and the adhesion force depends on the contact area. Texture width affects the contact area between the tip and substrate, and further influences friction behaviors. Three textured surfaces with different widths are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The widths are 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.3615 nm, 0.723 nm and 1.0845 nm, and the corresponding texture densities are 20%, 40% and 60%, respectively. For the three textures, 
 <italic>w</italic> + 
 <italic>g</italic> = 1.8075 nm is a constant, and the texture depth is 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.723 nm.
