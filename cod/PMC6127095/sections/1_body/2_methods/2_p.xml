<p id="Par15" class="p">For single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), a single crystal was mounted on the tip of Kapton loop, and data were collected on a Bruker Apex II X-ray diffractometer with Mo radiation K α
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (λ = 0.71073 Å). The SMART software was used for data acquisition over a full sphere of reciprocal space with 0.5° scans in ω with an exposure time of 10 s per frame. The 2θ range extended from 0° to 80°. Intensities were extracted and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects with the SAINT program. Numerical absorption corrections were accomplished with XPREP which is based on face-indexed absorption. The crystal structure was determined based on full-matrix least-squares methods using the SHELXTL package
