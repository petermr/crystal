<p id="Par29">One of the major implications of this mechanism, of the dissociation of vacancies into jog-pairs on screw dislocations, is the possibility of this mechanism occurring at low-angle twist grain boundaries, as demonstrated in the previous work on ionic rocksalt compounds

 </sup>, the conclusions regarding the dissociation of vacancies into jog-pairs at low angle twist grain boundaries, which can be viewed as a network of screw dislocations, in rock-salt oxides are still correct. However, the interpretation of the results needs to be revised. The large reduction in the energy of the dissociated vacancy as one of the jogs gets closer to the adjacent misfit dislocation intersections (MDI) within the grain boundaries should be interpreted as the result of the jog-MDI interaction since the interaction between jogs and screw dislocations in MgO, as revealed in current study, is a weak interaction, and the formation of dissociated vacancy in the form of jog pairs is driven mainly by entropy. In general, the current work offers a more accurate understanding of the physical processes involved.
