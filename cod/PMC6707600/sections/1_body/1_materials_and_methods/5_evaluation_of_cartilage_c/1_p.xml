<p>Cartilage canals were observed on 7-T MR images of fetuses with CRL between 37.2 and 112 mm (n = 32). The reference longitudinal plane passing through the midpoint of the femoral head, femoral neck, and greater trochanter was defined. Cartilage canal invasion was observed on planes parallel to the reference plane at the proximal epiphysis. Cartilage canal formation was evaluated by counting the number of cartilage canals in the femoral neck, fovea, and trochanteric fossa and by dividing them into three stages (-: not detected, +: 1–4, ++: &gt;5) (

Similarly, the reference horizontal plane for the distal metaphysis was defined, and cartilage canal invasion was observed on planes parallel to the reference plane at the distal epiphysis. Cartilage canal formation was evaluated by counting the number of cartilage canals in the intercondylar fossa and epicondyle and by dividing them into three stages (-: not detected, +: 1–4, ++: &gt;5).
