<p>During the phase change process with the application of pressure, the orthorhombic structure is maintained. The lattice parameter decreases monotonically with the application of the pressure and the compression has strong anisotropy. The reduced lattice parameters a, b, and c at 35 GPa are 0.877, 0.919, and 0.823, respectively, which implies that the main compression is along the c axis, namely, in the zigzag puckered direction. Similar behavior was discovered in layered crystal [

The variation of the cell volume with the pressure suggests that the atomic rearrangement is intensive. Thus, the transformation process is managed gradually. The dependence of the pressure on the neighbor Ge–Se and Ge–Ge bond lengths, marked in
