<p>Multiple EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> crystals (∼60 × 60 × 5 μm
 <sup>3</sup>) were tested by single crystal X-ray diffraction to determine the crystal structure of the new material. The structure, consistent among all crystals, was determined using a Bruker Apex II diffractometer equipped with Mo radiation (λ
 <sub>Kα</sub> = 0.710 73 Å) at room temperature. Glycerol was used to protect the samples, which were mounted on a Kapton loop. The scan width was set to 0.5° with an exposure time of 10 s. Four different positions of the goniometer and detector were selected. Data acquisition was made via Bruker SMART software with the corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects included.
