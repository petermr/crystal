<p id="Par9">At pressures above 20 GPa the crystal structure again experiences conventional contraction with the preservation of the most (
 <italic>c</italic>-axis) and least (
 <italic>a</italic>-axis) compressible directions. The evolution of the new-forming contacts P1–O8* and Be2–O2* is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The shortening of the Be2–O2* contact is smooth however distribution of Be–O bonds indicates that the Be[IV] to Be[V] transition occurs between 70 and 75 GPa (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). At 75 GPa BeO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra possesses trigonal bipyramidal geometry with two long apical (1.70 and 1.92 Å) and three short equatorial bonds (1.50–1.53 Å), while P1 still preserves tetrahedral coordination. Upon further compression of hurlbutite-II, BeO
 <sub>5</sub> evolves towards more regular trigonal bipyramid geometry by pronounced shortening of the Be–O2* bond.
