<p>The strength of the electromagnetic fields generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance at the vicinity of Ag nanoparticles strongly depends on the size of the Ag nanoparticles, which can be estimated using the 3D-FDTD simulation method. The commercial software FDTD Solutions (Lumerical Company) and KeyFDTD (Science and Technology Institute) were used to simulate the electromagnetic field and enhancement factors of Ag spherical nanoparticles in the function of diameter of Ag nanoparticles in the presence and absence of Au core particles (
