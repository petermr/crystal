<p>Clearly, the Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> CE does not significantly occur when GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP is used as the reactant under the same conditions that successfully lead to Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for In
 <sup>3+</sup> CE using InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP. Therefore, other Ga precursors were examined, starting with the simplest possible case: GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> dissolved in neat toluene. The reaction with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> at the same temperature used with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP (100 °C) was found to severely deteriorate the NCs (

To minimize the degradation, the temporal evolution of this reaction was studied at a lower temperature (30 °C) (

 </xref>b–e). The TEM images of the product NCs show that, despite the lower reaction temperature, a low-contrast spot appears in the NCs already after 15 min of reaction (
