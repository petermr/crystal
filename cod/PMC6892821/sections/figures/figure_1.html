 <caption> Ball-and-stick representation of primitive FCC unit cells of ( a) Cs 3Sb, ( b) Cs 2KSb, and ( c) CsK 2Sb. Sb atoms, depicted in black, are the origin of the cell at Wyckoff position (0,0,0), while Cs and K atoms (magenta and grey spheres, respectively) are located at crystal coordinates (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and ±(1/4, 1/4, 1/4), labelled A 1, A 2, and A 3 in panel (a). ( d) Brillouin zone of the adopted FCC unit cell with the high-symmetry points and the path connecting them marked in colour. ( c) Image of polycrystalline Cs-K-Sb photocathode film deposited on a Mo plug substrate, and mounted on a flag style sample holder. </caption>
