<p>Firstly, the entire system needs to be partitioned into multiple individual substructures and the substructures are modeled individually. Secondly, dynamic models of all the substructures are simply assembled to produce an uncoupled model of the entire structure. Thirdly, the coupling of interfaces is built and the assembled uncoupled model is transferred to the coupled model of the entire system. At last, by solving the coupled model, the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and dynamic equation can be obtained. In the following section, mathematical modeling of the DRG is conducted following the above steps.</p>
