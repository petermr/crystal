 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> The thicknesses of the single crystals obtained are between 20 and 100 µm, and the spin coherence lifetime is affected by Rashba splitting and phonon scattering, both depending on the layer thickness. When

Peng et al. believe that the decrease of the level of self‐doping and the decrease of the crystal sizes are the result of the defect‐inhibiting crystallization process by introducing large organic cation PEA.[qv: 16b] The diffraction patterns of PEA
