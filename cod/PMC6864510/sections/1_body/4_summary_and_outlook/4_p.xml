<p>The solar cells based on 2D layered perovskites have demonstrated excellent PCE and superior stability. The highest PCE of 2D/3D perovskites has been over 22% and it can be maintained in humid air for more than 1000 h under simulated sunlight, while PCE has fallen by only 10%. It offers a route toward efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. However, there are still some problems to be solved before commercialization. 1) More efforts need to be made to fully understand their crystal growth mechanism and to further improve the quality and morphology of the films. 2) Similarly, the defects caused by the phase impurity of 2D perovskites will capture the charges and lead to nonradiative recombination, thus inhibiting the charge extraction. So, strictly following the stoichiometric ratio of the reaction to precisely control the value of
