<p>Y(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> was first described by Kost et al. in 1978 [
 <xref rid="B239-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. Later, in 2017, Cao et al. demonstrated the partial reversibility of hydrogen storage [
 <xref rid="B240-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. Y(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> has a hydrogen content of 6.6 wt.% and it can be produced by the metathesis reaction between 3LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> + YCl
 <sub>3</sub> [
