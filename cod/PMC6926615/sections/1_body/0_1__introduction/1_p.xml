<p>The growing request of the market makes demands on modern photonics materials such as ability for miniaturization, higher efficiency, tunable and controllable optical and electrical properties, and stable performance. Thus, the scientific community tackles this challenge by the design and development of novel nanostructured optical materials. Among a wide variety of materials, perovskites can be highlighted thanks to their unique opto-electronic properties: High charge carrier mobility, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and high extinction coefficients, which can be tuned through all visible range.</p>
