<p>The gross view of the cartilaginous femur in fetuses may be already similar to—but not identical to—that in adults. The structure of the cartilaginous femur may require modification. One opportunity for modification occurs at the time of initial endochondral ossification and shortly after that, which was detected as the change in angle measurements (∠FNA, ∠FNS, and ∠OBS) between the “before ossification” group and the “OSL 0–5 mm” group, as well as the large variances in the “OSL 0–5 mm” group. Angle measurements reflect the torsion and flexion of the femur but are unrelated to longitudinal growth.</p>
