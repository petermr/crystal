<p>To date, the full understanding of superconductivity has posed a challenge for chemists as well as physicists.

 </sup> had provided adequate explanations for this phenomenon, the discoveries

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
 </sup> of unanticipated superconducting states in cuprates have raised further questions and, hence, induced massive explorative efforts. To account for the findings of superconductivity in cuprates, considerable attention was paid to the influence of electron spectrum instabilities (“singularities”), which are located at the Fermi levels of superconductors.

 </sup> Namely, the aforementioned electron spectrum instabilities are assumed to induce a structural distortion, which is counterbalanced by electrons residing in steep bands (“flat band/steep band scenario”).

 </sup> The latter idea
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
 </sup> implies that the occurrence of a superconducting state tends to be linked to the presence of a flat band at the Fermi level in a given material. In this context, one may also consider that a particular composition could affect the position of a flat band relative to the Fermi levels in a given series of isostructural compounds, as atomic substitutions and/or structural defects influence the chemical compositions and, furthermore, the electronic (band) structures within such a set of materials.

 </sup> Indeed, previous

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
 </sup> temperature-dependent electric resistance measurements for series of isostructural compounds revealed that metal-to-superconductor transitions are observed solely for those species for which singularities are “pinned” to the Fermi levels.
