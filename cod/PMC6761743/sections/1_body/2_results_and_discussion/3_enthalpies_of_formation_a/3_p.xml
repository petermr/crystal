<p>To examine the influence of vacancies on the dynamic stabilities of zirconium sulfides in more detail, the vibrational properties were also investigated for Zr
 <sub>3</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>, which has been reported

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> to crystallize with a superstructure of the NaCl-type sulfide and is zirconium-poorer relative to the other zirconium sulfides. An examination of the phonon DOS for Zr
 <sub>3</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>) shows that the phonon frequencies in Zr
 <sub>3</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> indeed correspond to less negative values than those in ZrS and Zr
 <sub>29</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub>. Accordingly, it may be inferred that the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of the zirconium sulfides alleviates this dynamic instability. The existence of negative values in the phonon DOS of Zr
 <sub>3</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> still indicates that this material should be dynamically unstable. This result raises the question of whether this dynamic instability could also be reduced through adopting a different, but closely related type of structure;

 </sup> yet, that prediction requires further explorations. To understand the tendencies to form the metal-deficient sulfides at the atomic level, we followed up with an analysis of the electronic band structures, densities-of-states, and projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations (pCOHP) for all sulfides.
