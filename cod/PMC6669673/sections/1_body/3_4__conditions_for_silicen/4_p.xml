According to the thermodynamics, if a Si atom deposited on this surface has enough time to wander between the two edges, then it will finally locate at the armchair edge because of the lower FE, and five similar Si atoms will form an armchair edge instead of a zigzag one. As a result, the armchair edge progresses row by row, and the initial silicene grain eventually grows into a nanoribbon along the [
