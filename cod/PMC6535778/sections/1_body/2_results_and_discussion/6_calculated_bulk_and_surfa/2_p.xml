 </xref>E shows that in the vicinity of the Fermi energy there are metal states mixed in in significant proportion at the top of the valence band and P states mixed in in significant proportion at the bottom of the conducting band; i.e., there is an inversion of the conventional type of band structure, where this kind of mixing of states above and below 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub> is negligible. When the effects of spin polarization are included, the total energies of the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) models are the lowest (the calculated energy difference between the AFM and FM states in EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> is about 13 meV per f.u.), and indicate that the observed antiferromagnetism is energy favored. The magnetic moments, calculated to be about ∼6.7 μ
 <sub>B</sub>, are solely on the Eu atoms, consistent with what is expected in a naïve picture for this material, where Eu is the only magnetic atom. The electronic structure of the material, calculated for the antiferromagnetically ordered system, shows that the bands near the Fermi level are hybridized among electrons from the p orbitals on the Sn and P atoms. The GGA and GGA+
 <italic>U</italic> calculations result in a semimetallic ground state, with no band gap, with Fermi surfaces around the Γ and A points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) (
