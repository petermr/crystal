<p>Here we have established that BrQ accumulates at the hemozoin crystal surface and at the digestive vacuole membrane, and possibly at other membranes of the parasite. The crystal surface coverage, measured as a fraction of its surface binding sites blocked by the drug, is between 4% and 15% analyzed for 2 parasites and 8 isolated crystals. We note the presence of BrQ in the lumen of the digestive vacuoles in regions outside the hemozoin crystals at submillimolar concentrations (discussed above), enough to cover an additional 7% of the hemozoin crystals. This result suggests that the BrQ coverage on hemozoin had reached a maximum. BrQ was also found capping large hemozoin crystals floating in the culture medium outside infected red blood cells in which they have been formed. The measured BrQ coverage at these hemozoin surfaces is also within the range of 4% and 15%. This observation confirms strong affinity of BrQ to the hemozoin crystal surface.</p>
