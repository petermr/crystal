<p>The title compound crystallizes in the 
 <italic>P</italic>4/
 <italic>mmm</italic> space group. The Fe
 <sup>II</sup> cation has a [FeN
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>] coordination environment (Fig. 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> ▸</xref>) comprising four CN
 <sup>−</sup> anions in the equatorial positions [Fe1—N1 = 2.158 (5) Å] and two water mol­ecules in the axial positions [Fe1—O1 = 2.130 (6) Å]. The Fe—O bonds are slightly shorter than the Fe–N bonds, thus leading to a compressed octa­hedral geometry. Judging by the bond length, the Fe
 <sup>II</sup> cation is in a high-spin state at the experimental temperature (180 K). This is corroborated by the presence of H
 <sub>2</sub>O mol­ecules in the coordination sphere of Fe
 <sup>II</sup>. The cyanide anions connect the Fe
 <sup>II</sup> and Pt
 <sup>II</sup> cations into infinite two-dimensional layers. The Pt
 <sup>II</sup> cation is located at a fourfold rotation axis and possesses a square-planar geometry [Pt1—C1 = 1.993 (6) Å, C1—Pt–C1 = 90°]. Thanks to the tetra­gonal symmetry of the crystalline compound, no deviation from an ideal octa­hedron is observed for Fe
 <sup>II</sup>, Σ|90 – θ| = 0°, where θ is the N—Fe—N or O—Fe—N angles. Additionally, the compound incorporates two guest mol­ecules of acetone per Fe
 <sup>II</sup> centers.
