<p>The tetragonal crystal structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f003">Figure 3</xref>) can be defined as a superstructure of perovskite with a doubled 
 <italic>a
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> axis along the 
 <italic>c</italic> direction. This superstructure is due to the long-range ordering of the oxygen vacancies, quantified in the neutron refinement, and concentrated at the O2 and O3 positions. For this reason, the superstructure could not be detected from XRD data, given the weak scattering factor for oxygen atoms. The 
 <italic>z</italic>(O2) coordinate (
 <xref rid="materials-12-01957-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is slightly shifted from ¾, determining alternating elongated (Co,Ru)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedral layers, containing Co2 atoms, and flattened Co1O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedral layers containing Co1 atoms. The (Co,Ru)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra share O3 atoms, while Co1O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra share O1 atoms. Finally, both octahedra layers share O2 atoms. These differences in the octahedral size suggest that Co1 cations might present a higher oxidation state, closer to 4+, whereas Co2 is close to 3+, assuming a full charge disproportionation. In fact, the presence of Co
 <sup>3+</sup> with an intermediate-spin state in Co2 sites could cause the Jahn-Teller distortion of the Co–O bond lengths, and O
 <sup>2−</sup> ions would approach Co
 <sup>4+</sup> cations, moving from Co2 to Co1, justifying the observed shift of O2 atoms.
