<p>Nyquist plots from the impedance experimental data were conducted with the aim of studying the effect of temperature on the electrical response of the synthetized materials; the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The Nyquist plot exhibits a semicircle and a straight line at low frequency, but the magnitude of the diameter of the semicircle reduced as the temperature increased in both studied materials. This experimental evidence suggests an impedance reduction of the “bulk” and grain boundary processes. The presence of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot was associated with the electron transport processes on the “bulk”, in which there are a contribution of inter-crystalline and intra-crystalline charge transport processes. Also, in this region, a possible additional contribution to the electrical response came from protonic conduction (H
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sup>+</sup>) because of the interlayer water in the birnessite structure. The observations corresponding to the electron transport process are concurrent with the results of previous research [

 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the preparation methods reported here produced materials with less impedance compared to previous work [

 <sup>+</sup> ions located in the interlayer region, which follow a Warburg diffusion process. The straight lines observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b indicated that the ionic diffusion was preserved up to 373 K, due to the satisfactory thermal stability of these materials (
