 <sub>2</sub>O has two main steps of mass loss from the TG curve. There are 10% mass losses in the first small stage in the temperature range of 150–200 °C for the loss of three crystal water molecules per formula unit. The second large stage in the temperature interval between 350 and 600 °C lost mass is about 40%, which is similar to the calculated value and can be assigned to the decomposition of the (H
