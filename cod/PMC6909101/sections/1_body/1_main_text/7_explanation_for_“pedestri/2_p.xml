<p id="p0635">Quantum mechanics was invented in the last century to explain the quantum jumps of an electron in an atom. Let's assume that the atom can be schematically modeled by a one-dimensional potential box (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]? In a molecule in the process of a quantum transition from one state to another state, the nuclear subsystem is reorganized, that is, the equilibrium positions of the nuclear vibrations are adjusted to the new distribution of the electron charge in the final state. What does this adjustment or reorganization correspond to in the scheme of the one-dimensional potential box [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]? Obviously, this reorganization corresponds to the motion of at least one of the two walls of the potential box during the quantum transition. There are only two options of the motion of this wall chosen by us. The first option: the wall moves freely, that is, without friction. The second option: the wall moves with friction [
