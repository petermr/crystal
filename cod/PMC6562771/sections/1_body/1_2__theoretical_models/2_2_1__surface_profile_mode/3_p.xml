 <xref rid="B25-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], tool edge waviness is inevitably observed on the cutting edge of the diamond tool, which can be measured by the diamond-tool-radius-check (DTRC) system. Due to the existence of tool edge waviness on the cutting tool edge, deviations between the circular arc surface topography and the actual surface topography are unavoidable. For instance, Sung et al. once adopted a high-resolution optical system to capture the image of an active tool nose profile, and their investigations show that the deviation of the tool nose profile, i.e., the tool edge waviness, alone can cause the surface roughness to vary in a large extent [
