<p>In this work, the molecular dynamics simulation software was used to study the influence mechanism of montmorillonite charge density on hydration performance by studying the Z-density distribution of water molecules, H
 <sub>w</sub>, and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer, the mean square displacement curve (MSD) and diffusion coefficient of water molecules, and the radial distribution function (RDF) of Ca-H
 <sub>w</sub>, Ca-O
 <sub>w</sub>, Ca-O
 <sub>t</sub>, O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>, and O
 <sub>t</sub>-Q
 <sub>w</sub>.
