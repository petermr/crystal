<p>The first 2D layered lead halide perovskite (C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>19</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> was obtained by Dolzhenko et al. in 1986.

 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> shows the ability to intercalate with appropriate organic solvents through weak interaction. Another 2D perovskite (C

 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> was reported by Ishihara et al.,
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> which is similar to a quantum well (QW) structure where inorganic layers are separated by insulating organic layers. Over the years, 2D organicâ€“inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have been known by researchers, but they have not achieved the same attention as their 3D analogues.
