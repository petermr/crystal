 <caption> Calculated electronic structure and basic properties of EuMnBi 2 and YbMnBi 2. a Crystal structures of both materials together with the corresponding Brillouin Zones. Green lines and a point are a locus of Dirac crossings according to the calculations not taking into account spin–orbit interaction (Supplementary Figs  1– 4). Red arrows are magnetic moments of Mn atoms. Inset shows the locations of 3D-Dirac points found in the AFM-SOC calculations. b Results of the fully relativistic band-structure calculations taking into account perfectly antiferromagnetic arrangement of Mn moments. c Corresponding Fermi contours for ΓXM and TNP high symmetry planes. d Resistivities and e Magnetoresistances of EuMnBi 2 and YbMnBi 2. f Magnetization curves showing the onset of the magnetism which breaks time-reversal symmetry in YbMnBi 2 </caption>
