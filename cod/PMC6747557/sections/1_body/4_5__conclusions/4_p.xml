<p>(3) In the test of conductivity characteristics from four different densities of polyethylene, the electric field threshold of the ohmic region (T1 region) corresponding to LDPE, LLDPE, MDPE, and HDPE to the non-ohmic region is gradually reduced. Meanwhile, the field strength corresponding to turning point B of the non-ohmic zone is also gradually decreased. Its mechanism may be that the conductivity of the four materials gradually decreases, and the number of carriers decreases correspondingly under the same field strength. Therefore, the carriers in large numbers may be the first to reach the turning point.</p>
