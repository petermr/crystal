 <p id="Par1">The Dresselhaus and Rashba effects are well-known phenomena in solid-state physics, in which spinâ€“orbit coupling splits spin-up and spin-down energy bands of nonmagnetic non-centrosymmetric crystals. Here, we discuss a phenomenon we dub band splitting with vanishing spin polarizations (BSVSP), in which, as usual, spin-orbit coupling splits the energy bands in nonmagnetic non-centrosymmetric systems. Surprisingly, however, both split bands show no net spin polarization along certain high-symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. In order to rationalize this phenomenon, we propose a classification of point groups into pseudo-polar and non-pseudo-polar groups. By means of first-principles simulations, we demonstrate that BSVSP can take place in both symmorphic (e.g., bulk GaAs) and non-symmorphic systems (e.g., two dimensional ferroelectric SnTe). Furthermore, we identify a linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space, which could be employed to tune the spin polarization with an external electric field. The BSVSP effect and its manipulation could therefore form the basis for future spintronic devices.</p>
