 <caption> Calculated proton hole center (PHC) diffusion networks at the ZnOâ€“liquid-water interface, for (a) the ZnO(101[combining macron]0) surface, and (b) the ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surface. The proton transfer (PT) and proton hole transfer (PHT) processes take place between PHCs, that can be located at surface O atoms, surface Zn atoms, or between two surface Zn atoms. Thicker solid lines indicate processes with greater rates. For lines with gradients, transferring the PHC from the dark end to the light end has a greater barrier than the reverse reaction. The dotted lines indicate movement of the PHC ( Fig. 6), i.e., a process without proton transfer. </caption>
