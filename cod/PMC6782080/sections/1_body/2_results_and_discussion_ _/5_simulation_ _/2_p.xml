<p>The superposition structures [step (ii)] of each twin model were used for the simulation of electron diffraction (ED) patterns rendered possible by the translational invariance of the reciprocal lattice. The simulated ED pattern and FFT images calculated from experimental HRTEM micrographs of the two twin boundaries are compared qualitatively in Fig. 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> â–¸</xref>. Both the FFT images and the simulated ED pattern from the structure models match on a qualitative basis, indicating the quality of the superposition structure. However, owing to the impact of the contrast transfer function on HRTEM micrographs, an exact match between the FFT and the pure kinematic simulation is not possible.
