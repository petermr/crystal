<p id="Par14">The underbonded-oxygen argument also applies to the effects of Pb off-centering on the ordering of Mg and Nb. This off-centering, which modifies the bonding state of oxygen, has been previously suggested to stabilize the Mg/Nb configurations that could be electrostatically less favorable

 </sup>. In fact, competition between long-range electrostatic and short-range Pb–O interactions could be a reason for favoring a partially ordered 1:1 type array of Mg and Nb over the completely ordered 1:2 layered arrangement. Thus, the existence of a relationship between the degree of Mg/Nb ordering and at least the static Pb displacements is chemically reasonable. We do observe that the overall Pb displacements in the instantaneous configuration are enhanced in the cores of CORs if only slightly; the small magnitude of this effect is determined by the continuously varying degree of ordering (see Supplementary Fig.
