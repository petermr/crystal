 <sub>2</sub> has the calcium fluoride (CaF
 <sub>2</sub>) structure with U ions on the fcc lattice while O ions surround U ions forming a cubic structure. Screw dislocations in UO
 <sub>2</sub> have been relatively less well studied compared to edge dislocations. Based on the Peierls-Nabarro modeling and interatomic potentials, Skelton and Walker

 </sup> calculated the Peierls stresses for screw dislocations gliding on {100}, {110} and {111}, and concluded that screw dislocations in UO
 <sub>2</sub> have a preferred slip system of a
 <sub>0</sub>/2〈1 1 0〉{100}, followed by a
 <sub>0</sub>/2〈1 1 0〉{111}, similar to what is found for edge dislocations

 </sup>, and in general agreement with experiments
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. This finding is validated most recently by direct Peierls stress calculations using a variable charge many-body empirical potential (the second moment tight-binding potential with charge equilibration (SMTB-Q)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>) although the magnitude of the Peierls stress differed in the two treatments.
