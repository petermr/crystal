<p>In this context, we previously described devices consisting of mm-sized poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) polymer disks (PDs) containing upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) and infused with Roussin’s black salt Na[Fe
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub>(NO)

 </sup> UCNPs serve as antennas to effect NIR-to-visible (or UV) upconversion by sequential multiphoton excitation at 980 nm with the lanthanide ion Yb
 <sup>3+</sup> as the light-absorbing sensitizer and a second lanthanide ion (Er
 <sup>3+</sup> or Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>) as the emitter of visible and/or UV wavelengths after energy transfer from the sensitizer.

 </sup> The upconverted light emitted from the UCNPs was reabsorbed by the RBS, leading to photoinduced NO release from this photoNORM.

 </sup> The advantage of UCNPs is that upconversion requires much lower-excitation intensities than does simultaneous two-photon excitation; so, one can use a relatively simple diode laser operating at 980 nm to effect multiphoton excitation of the UCNPs leading to NO release.

 </sup> Furthermore, we demonstrated that NIR excitation triggered photouncaging from these RBS-containing devices even through tissue filters.
