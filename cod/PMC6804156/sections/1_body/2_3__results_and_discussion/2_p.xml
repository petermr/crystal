<p>It turned out that three annealing steps were necessary in order to obtain single phase Rb

 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>):Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> compounds. The powder XRD patterns of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) specimen after each annealing step are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Figure S2</xref>. It is obvious that the peaks belonging to the phases other than Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) disappear only after the third heat treatment. Moreover, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Figure S2</xref> also demonstrates that single phase compounds are obtained despite the increasing Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> amount in the synthesized materials. The representative powder XRD pattern of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) compound is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f001">Figure 1</xref>. All the peaks match well with the reference pattern of K
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>). The only difference in these XRD patterns is the slight shift of peaks for Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) compound to the lower 2θ values. On the other hand, this can be expected since the ionic radius of potassium ions is slightly smaller than for rubidium ions, 1.51 and 1.61 Å for CN = 8, respectively [
