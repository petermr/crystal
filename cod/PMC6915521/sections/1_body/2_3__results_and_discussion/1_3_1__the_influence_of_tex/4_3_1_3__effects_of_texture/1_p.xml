<p>The texture orientation 
 <italic>θ</italic> is defined as the angle between the longitudinal direction of texture and 
 <italic>y</italic> axis, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f009">Figure 9</xref>. The tip slides along 
 <italic>x</italic> direction. In order to study the effects of texture orientation on friction behaviors, five different orientations (
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°) are used. For all the textures, the width is 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.723 nm, the spacing is 
 <italic>g</italic> = 1.0845 nm, and the depth is 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.723 nm.
