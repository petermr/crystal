<p>A ToF instrument also records faster photoelectrons, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> from higher orders (2
 <italic>h</italic>ν, 3
 <italic>h</italic>ν) of the monochromator/undulator. Photoelectrons released by higher-order photons are much faster and thus have a shorter ToF τ. If τ is shorter by one period of the exciting photon pulses (for the large storage ring PETRA III, 192 ns or 96 ns in the 40- or 80-bunch mode, respectively), higher-order signals appear in the same time interval as the photoelectrons from first order.
