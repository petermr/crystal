<p>Accordingly, the band gap energy of each sample became small on the order of the tetragonal (Bi
 <sub>0.97</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.03</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.06</sub>, the cubic (Bi
 <sub>0.80</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.20</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.40</sub>, and the monoclinic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> samples, corresponding to the short of the average bond length. Therefore, the optical absorption wavelength of the tetragonal (Bi
 <sub>0.97</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.03</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.06</sub> sample was located on the lowest energy (i.e., longer wavelength) side. The slope of the reflectance spectrum became moderate in the case of the cubic (Bi
 <sub>0.80</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.20</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.40</sub> sample, because of the reduction of the hybrid effect due to the decrease in the Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> content. Among the (Bi

 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3+2

 </sub> samples synthesized in this study, the (Bi
 <sub>0.97</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.03</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.06</sub> sample exhibited the strongest absorption in the green-blue light region (480–490 nm), which is the complementary color of orange.
