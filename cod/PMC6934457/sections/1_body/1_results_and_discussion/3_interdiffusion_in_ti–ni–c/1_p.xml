<p id="Par12">The degree of the interdiffusion was characterized by ToF-SIMS. Two areas with overall compositions of Ti
 <sub>75</sub>Ni
 <sub>15</sub>Cu
 <sub>10</sub> and Ti
 <sub>10</sub>Ni
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>40</sub> from the chip deposited as sequence 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) were analysed, representing the Ti corner and the area with less than 10% Ti content, respectively. The depth profile of the elements Ti, Ni, Cu, and Si are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Si was used to mark the boundary between the sample and the substrate. The 
 <sup>50</sup>Ti
 <sup>+</sup>and 
 <sup>60</sup>Ni
 <sup>+</sup> signals were chosen to represent the distribution of Ti and Ni, respectively, since the intensity of Ti
 <sup>+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>+</sup> were sometimes beyond the upper detection limit. For both samples, the distribution of each element before heat treatment was highly consistent with the designed layer stack. We noticed that the Ni peaks shifted slightly towards the Ti layer during deposition, which was mainly because of the large negative heat of mixing

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> between Ni and Ti. During the deposition process, the deposition temperature and the large negative enthalpy of mixing promoted the inter-diffusion of Ti and Ni. In comparison, the peak position of Cu was unchanged.
