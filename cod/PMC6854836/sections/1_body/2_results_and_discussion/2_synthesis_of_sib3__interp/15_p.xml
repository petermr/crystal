<p>To conclude this section, we report more detailed results from the PXRD analyses of the various samples.

 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref> compile the results of the refinements. The obtained structure parameters for β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> agree well with the initially reported model of Salvador et al. (based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction data)—and there is no reason to doubt the established crystal structure of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>. Intensities in the PXRD pattern of the α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> sample decrease rapidly with increasing 2θ, which is characteristic for disordered materials. At first sight, the fit to the structure model of Magnusson and Brosset appears reasonable. The refined occupancy of the polar icosahedral position (∼33% Si) suggests a composition, which is close to the electron-precise composition SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub>. However, site occupancies from PXRD data will not be reliable because of the lack of intensity for high-angle reflections. For the same reason, the refined U
 <sub>iso</sub> values are 3–4 times larger compared to β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, whose PXRD pattern displays more regular intensities for the high-angle reflections. It is interesting to note that the molar volumes of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> are very similar, which implies that β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> is not a high-pressure phase in the Si–B system.
