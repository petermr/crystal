 </sup> the aliovalent Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for In
 <sup>3+</sup> exchange in Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S NCs is in the reaction-limited regime. The incorporation of In
 <sup>3+</sup> is preceded by the adsorption of the InX
 <sub>3</sub> precursor on the NC surface. The displacement of the X
 <sup>–</sup> ligand is proposed to occur by nucleophilic attack of lattice S
 <sup>2–</sup> ions on the adsorbed InX
 <sub>3</sub> precursor.

 </sup> The height of the energy barrier for this reaction is given by the leaving-group ability of the X
 <sup>–</sup> ligand.

 </sup> We add that when a direct place exchange reaction is promoted by using a TOP–InCl
 <sub>3</sub> complex, the energy barrier is lowered by the formation of an incipient bond between the P donor group and a Cu
 <sup>+</sup> ion in the vicinity of the S
 <sup>2–</sup> ion responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the In–Cl bond. This makes the reaction rates faster and allows for a direct place exchange between the incoming In
 <sup>3+</sup> guest cation and one outgoing Cu
 <sup>+</sup> cation, while facilitating extraction of two additional Cu
 <sup>+</sup> ions as neutral CuCl units. However, the formation of such an activated complex imposes constraints on the orientation of the binding TOP–InCl
 <sub>3</sub> with respect to the surface Cu
 <sup>+</sup> and S
 <sup>2–</sup>. Nevertheless, in the case of Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for In
 <sup>3+</sup> CE, these constraints are not very strict because the activated complex can follow only two possible reaction pathways: CE or desorption without reaction, in which case it may bind again in the proper orientation later.
