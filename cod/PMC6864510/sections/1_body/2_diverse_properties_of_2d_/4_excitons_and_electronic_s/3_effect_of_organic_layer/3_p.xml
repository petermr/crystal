However, in some other applications, strong exciton–phonon coupling is desirable and may be beneficial for the white light emission

 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> is 44 meV. They are relatively larger values compared to other semiconductors. This is so because the value of biexciton binding energy depends on the gap energy difference between “well” and “barrier” in the quantum well structure.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">96</xref> Recently, Sanvitto's group reported that biexciton also influenced exciton confinement and spectral response, in terms of affecting the out‐of‐plane exciton–photon interaction.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">97</xref> Different organic cations cause different bandgap energies and lead to different biexciton binding energies.
