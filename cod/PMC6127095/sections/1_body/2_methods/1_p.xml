It is then hydrostatically pressed into cylinder-shaped rods, and further sintered at 950 °C for another 12 h in oxygen atmosphere. Single crystals were grown through melting the feed rod and moving downward with the speed of 30 mm/h. To prevent oxygen deficiency, 0.9 MPa oxygen pressure was applied during the growth. In addition, both feed and seed rods were rotated in opposite directions at 20 rpm to improve homogeneity and reduce possible impurity.
