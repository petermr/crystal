<p>The loading efficiency was analyzed by ICP-MS. The PDs were digested in a 5 mL volume of a 1 M ammonium tetrafluoroborate solution in THF for 5 days. The solutions were then heated at 50 °C to evaporate the THF, and the resulting oils were further digested in concentrated nitric acid for 2 days. The nitric acid was then removed by heating, and the resulting solution was redissolved into a 2% nitric acid solution. Analysis was carried out using an Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole ICP-MS calibrated against a chromium standard. Although there was some variation from disk to disk, the loading efficiency, after washing, fell in the range of 65–97% (82% ave.) of the initial PetACrONO available.</p>
