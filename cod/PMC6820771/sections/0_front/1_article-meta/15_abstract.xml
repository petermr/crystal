 <p id="Par2">The performance of electrocatalysts for the renewable production of hydrogen is currently limited due to the difficulty of materials design. We show that tailoring the electronic structure under applied reductive bias is key to optimal electrocatalytic performance of a 2D chalcogenide material.</p>
