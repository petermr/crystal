<p>Although perovskite materials, in particular lead-halide perovskites, have already been implemented in different areas of photovoltaics, there are still some problems that need to be tackled. The main challenges are the increasing of the stability and mass production, and the development of the new lead-free materials. The publication analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows that the number of papers on lead-free perovskites has also increased, especially over the last five years, and now reaches 14% from all number of papers. The solution of these problems will result in increased performance of the photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices based on the perovskite active media. In 2017, Zeijiao Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reviewed the research field devoted to lead-free perovskite materials and revealed the main trends that need to be developed: Understanding of the fundamental photophysics and finding novel synthetic routes for lead-free perovskite materials. Since then, many scientific papers were published. We want to highlight in this piece some of the recent review papers on this topic.
