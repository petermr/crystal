<p>Melamine was purchased from Alfa Aesar (A11295; ≥99% purity) and used without further purification. The measurement of IR spectra was carried out on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer that was equipped with an ATR accessory and a diamond prism (PerkinElmer, Inc. Waltham, MA, USA). The spectrometer was controlled by Perkin Elmer Spectrum software (version 10.4.00). The spectra were measured in the 4000–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region with a spectral resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The number of accumulated scans was 16, and the measurement procedure was triplicated. The measurement was carried out at room temperature (~298 K). Sample preparation and spectra recording procedures were triplicated for each sample.
