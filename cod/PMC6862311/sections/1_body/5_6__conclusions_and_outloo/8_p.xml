<p>Finally, we would like to speculate on the future development of AXCCA. Being a general analysis technique, AXCCA could be used in studies of almost any system with angular correlations. In this review, we considered several examples, such as the hexatic phase in LCs, colloidal crystals and self-assembling nanoparticles, but in principle AXCCA could provide valuable information on the orientational order in almost any soft matter system. Moreover, combining AXCCA with resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS), could potentially reveal hidden features of magnetic and charge order superstructures in hard condensed matter systems, for example, the lattice of skyrmions [

 <xref rid="B110-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. It was also shown [
 <xref rid="B111-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] that combinations of AXCCA with the multiple-wavelength resonant scattering can be used for element-specific imaging of various nanoscale objects.
