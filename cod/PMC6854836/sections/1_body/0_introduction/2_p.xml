<p>The semiconducting α-rhombohedral phase of boron (α-B
 <sub>12</sub>) is parent to a family of refractory materials—sometimes referred to as “α-B
 <sub>12</sub> derived icosahedral boron-rich solids”

 <sub>4</sub>C, B
 <sub>6</sub>O, B
 <sub>6</sub>P, B
 <sub>6</sub>S, B
 <sub>6</sub>As, B
 <sub>13</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>, B
 <sub>6</sub>Se, and SiB
 <sub>3</sub>.

 </sup> Besides a high thermal stability, these materials possess a low mass density, extreme hardness, chemical inertness, and variable semiconductor properties.

 </sup> α-B
 <sub>12</sub>-derived solids have been intensively investigated not only for their useful materials properties but also for their unusual structures and “electron-deficient” chemical bonding.

 </sup> The majority of compounds have homogeneity ranges, especially with respect to the nonboron component.

 </sup> This work deals with the representative SiB
