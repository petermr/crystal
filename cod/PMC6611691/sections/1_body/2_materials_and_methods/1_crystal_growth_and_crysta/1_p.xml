<p>High-quality single crystals of LMO were grown using a temperature gradient flux method, and their axes were identified by a Bruker D8 QUEST single crystal x-ray diffractometer. Individual crystals were then blade cleaved within the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane to obtain thin, bar-shaped samples of approximate dimensions 600 μm by 200 μm by 40 μm.
