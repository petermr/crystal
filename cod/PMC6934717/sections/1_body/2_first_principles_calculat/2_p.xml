 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> we have used the local density approximation (LDA), with arsenic height and lattice parameters taken directly from our experimental XRD refinements (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), except as stated below. An RK
 <sub>max</sub> value of 8.0 – the product of the smallest sphere radius and largest planewave expansion wavevector – was used. To avoid the generally confounding complexities of 4

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> and performed the all-electron calculations with the isoelectronic substitution of Sr for the divalent Eu, but retained our lattice parameters and internal coordinates for EuFe
 <sub>2</sub>As
 <sub>2</sub>. The effect of these choices is to allow a direct evaluation of the Fe sublattice magnetic properties without the need to apply a correlated (i.e. LDA + U) approach to deal with the Eu 4 
 <italic>f</italic> electrons, which play little or no role in the Fe magnetism. Sphere radii of 2.5 Bohr were used for Sr, and between 2.26 and 2.30 for Fe (depending on volume), and between 2.15 and 2.22 for As. Identical sphere radii were used for the calculations at given volume, relevant for assessing the interlayer coupling.
