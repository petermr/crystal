<p>To further probe the angle-resolved photosensitivity of our device, we first held the incident laser at fixed values (wavelength: 633 nm, power 1.4 mW), then swept the source–drain voltage from 0 mV to 10 mV, and varied the angle of the TE/RE pairs from 0° to 150°. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. As the test angle was changed, the

 <sub>ds</sub> increased to different degrees. Furthermore, an increase in the drain current by a factor of ≈15 was observed related to the test angles at 60° and 150°, respectively, which indicates the highly anisotropic photosensitivity of our device based on 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. Additionally, the photosensitivity was defined as:
