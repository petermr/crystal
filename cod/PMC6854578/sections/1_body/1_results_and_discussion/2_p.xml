<p>In the first layer, the density distribution of Na

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>a,b, respectively. One can see that, in the first layer, Na
 <sup>+</sup> prefers to coordinate with water molecules, while Cl
 <sup>–</sup> prefers to coordinate with Na
 <sup>+</sup>. Our calculations show that, around 39.7% of Na
 <sup>+</sup> coordinate with Cl
 <sup>–</sup> and water molecules at the same time, while the rest Na
 <sup>+</sup> do not coordinate with Cl
 <sup>–</sup> but only with water molecules (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0). However, around 92.2% of Cl
 <sup>–</sup> coordinate with Na
 <sup>+</sup> and water molecules at the same time and 7.8% of Cl
 <sup>–</sup> coordinate only with water molecules (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0). Evidently, Na
 <sup>+</sup> has stronger tendency to keep the hydration structure, which is consistent with previous results.
