<p>The novel quantum material EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> was designed based on chemical criteria to display both magnetism and electronic surface states. The hypothesized material was discovered, and crystals were grown using the Sn-flux method. Its crystal structure and physical properties were characterized. Its crystal structure consists of hexagonal Eu, and P layers surrounding a Sn bilayer. It has a positive Curie–Weiss temperature of Θ
 <sub>CW</sub> = 31(1) K, showing the dominance of ferromagnetic spin correlations at high temperatures, but it orders antiferromagnetically near 30 K. Its ordered magnetic structure, refined from neutron diffraction, shows antiferromagnetically coupled in-plane-ferromagnetic Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> layers. The temperature-dependent resistance of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> is weakly metallic in character, and an anomalous magnetoresistance is found below the magnetic ordering temperature and below applied magnetic fields of 4 T, where the magnetization saturates with applied magnetic field.
