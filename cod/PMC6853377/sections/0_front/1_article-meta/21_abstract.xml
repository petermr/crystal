 <p>An alternative approach to hard-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) has been established. The instrumental key feature is an increase of the 
  <italic>dimensionality</italic> of the recording scheme from 2D to 3D. A high-energy momentum microscope detects electrons with initial kinetic energies up to 8 keV with a 
  <italic>k</italic>-resolution of 0.025 Å
  <sup>−1</sup>, equivalent to an angular resolution of 0.034°. A special objective lens with 
  <italic>k</italic>-space acceptance up to 25 Å
  <sup>−1</sup> allows for simultaneous full-field imaging of many Brillouin zones. Combined with time-of-flight (ToF) parallel energy recording this yields maximum parallelization. Thanks to the high brilliance (10

  <sup>−1</sup> in a spot of &lt;20 µm diameter) of beamline P22 at PETRA III (Hamburg, Germany), the microscope set a benchmark in HAXPES recording speed, 
  <italic>i.e.</italic> several million counts per second for core-level signals and one million for 
  <italic>d</italic>-bands of transition metals. The concept of tomographic 
  <italic>k</italic>-space mapping established using soft X-rays works equally well in the hard X-ray range. Sharp valence band 
  <italic>k</italic>-patterns of Re, collected at an excitation energy of 6 keV, correspond to direct transitions to the 28th repeated Brillouin zone. Measured total energy resolutions (photon bandwidth plus ToF-resolution) are 62 meV and 180 meV FWHM at 5.977 keV for monochromator crystals Si(333) and Si(311) and 450 meV at 4.0 keV for Si(111). Hard X-ray photoelectron diffraction (hXPD) patterns with rich fine structure are recorded within minutes. The short photoelectron wavelength (10% of the interatomic distance) ‘amplifies’ phase differences, making full-field hXPD a sensitive structural tool.
