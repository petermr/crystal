<p>The lattice parameters computed for the 
 <italic>Pc</italic> structure 10* closely match the experimental values (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>). The computed β angle, in particular, is now almost perfect (discrepancy 0.51° for PBE-TS, 0.03° for PBE-D2). The larger discrepancies for the computed 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic> structures could be attributed to slight differences in the conformation of the molecules (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>), which affect their packing with a more inclined unit cell. Most of the experimental GIXD pattern is reproduced by the 
 <italic>Pc</italic> structure 10* as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref> (structure factors are indicated by the ring size). Some more comparisons between diffractograms of experimental and computed structures are illustrated in the

It should be noted that a discrepancy of some peaks exists, which requires a further refinement which in single crystal or powder diffraction is regularly done to account for crystal dimensions, transparency/absorption, crystal defects, or molecular disorder.
