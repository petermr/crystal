<p>Eight of the transition metals crystallize in the fcc structure, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab21" ref-type="table">21</xref> below, including the plasmonic noble metals and important catalytically active elements. The vast majority of nanocluster synthesis has been with these elements. References of the synthesis of the fcc elements with various shapes and sizes is given in Table
