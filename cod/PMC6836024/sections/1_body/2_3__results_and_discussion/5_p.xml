<p>The maximal values of relative sensitivity (S
 <sub>1</sub>) of V
 <sup>5+</sup>-based luminescent thermometer, which exceed 2%/°C, were found at temperatures below −100 °C and with increase of temperature S
 <sub>1</sub> gradually decreases reaching 1.34%/°C, 1.12%/°C, 1.13%/°C, 1.30%/°C and 0.76%/°C for Y

 <sub>12</sub>, which is in agreement with our expectation that short distance between V
 <sup>5+</sup> and V
 <sup>4+</sup> facilitates the interionic energy transfer between them. The presented correlations confirm that relative sensitivity of temperature sensors based on V
 <sup>5+</sup> emission intensity can be modulated by varying the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>-concentration (

 <sup>4+</sup> temperature sensors, the highest value of sensitivity reveal the YGG nanocrystals (S

 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. Moreover, the temperature at which maximal S

 <sup>3+</sup> concentration from 75 °C for Y
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>4</sub>GaO
 <sub>12</sub> to −15 °C for YGG. This phenomenon is also observed in the case of biological temperature range, where reducing the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration the S value decreases from 1.32%/°C at 0 °C to 0.2%/°C at 30 °C for Y

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f003">Figure 3</xref>f). It should be mentioned here that usable temperature range for this luminescent thermometer (temperature range in which Ω reveals monotonic change) is limited, and the most narrow one was found for YGG (from −100 °C to 120 °C). The negative values of S
 <sub>2</sub> come from the fact of the intensity trend reversal. Hence, the balance between relative sensitivity and the usable temperature range can be optimized by the appropriate host material composition. Therefore, depending on the type of application of such luminescent thermometer, including required relative sensitivity and operating temperatures range, different stoichiometry of host material can be proposed. Since the V
 <sup>3+</sup> emission intensity monotonically decreases in the temperature range below 200 °C the relative sensitivity S
 <sub>3</sub> reveals positive values with the single maxima at temperature which is dependent on the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f003">Figure 3</xref>g). The increase of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> amount causes the reduction of both value of the S
 <sub>3</sub> and the temperature of S max from 1.08%/°C at 152 °C for Y
