 </sup> Because they are formed by periodically stacking single-chain atomic crystals (SCACs) that have strong intrachain bonds with weak van der Waals (vdW) interchain interactions, these 1D materials are prepared by isolating SCACs from bulk crystals (similar to 2D materials). The structural characteristics of 1D materials result in a surface free from dangling bonds which hinder application of 2D materials.

 </sup> However, it is difficult to clearly determine the crystal structure of Mo
 <sub>6</sub>S
 <sub>9–

 </sub>I
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> because the positions of the sulfur and iodine ions coordinated to the central molybdenum ions may vary, even at the same stoichiometric composition. In addition, the thermodynamic properties of the ternary system (Mo–S–I) are not well known, which makes it difficult to understand the physical properties of the Mo

 </sub> material. In addition, Sb
