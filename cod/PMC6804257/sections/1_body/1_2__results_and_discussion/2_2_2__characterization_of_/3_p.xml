<p>After the release of water molecules, all the complexes started the decomposition of the receptor in a similar fashion. The residual metal oxide formed after thermal treatment was employed to calculate metal content in each complex. For all metal complexes, the experimental values were in good agreement with the calculated values based on the number of water molecules detected.</p>
