<p>Here we present the software 
 <italic>GIDVis</italic>, which is a comprehensive tool for the data analysis of GIXD data of static or rotating samples, incorporating many aspects of other tools within one program, and adding additional and easy-to-use features for the evaluation of rotating GIXD data. The software is capable of dealing with all kinds of data, including linear and area-detector data from static detectors or detectors mounted on goniometer arms. It allows the user to perform all basic data handling like summation or stitching of data from different detector positions and contains a full set of tools to perform an evaluation of crystallographic properties.
