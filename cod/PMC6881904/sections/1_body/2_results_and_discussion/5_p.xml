 </xref>b). At initial delay time around 106 μs, no emission band appears, while a single broad band centered at about 720 nm emerges clearly at delay time around 107 μs due to the energy depopulation of excited Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. By prolonging delay time, the intensity of the whole Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> characteristic band monotonically increases to a maximum at about 120 μs and then decreases. Notably, the band shapes and peak position of all the emissions remain unchanged at different delay time points. These results suggest that all the Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> activators do have similar surrounding environments.
