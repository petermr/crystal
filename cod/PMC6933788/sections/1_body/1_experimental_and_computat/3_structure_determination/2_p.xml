 </sup> During the refinement process, we found that Na(1) and Na(1B) were in positional disorder in the structure of the compound. We restricted the sum of the ratio of Na(1) and Na(1B) as 1 and refined them by the least-square method, which can help to get better R values. The crystal data and structure refinement information are summarized in
