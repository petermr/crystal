<p>In summary, the crystal structure model 
 <bold>4</bold> extracted from high-resolution SC-XRD provides an average structure for disordered α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> with reasonable geometric parameters and suggests a composition SiB
 <sub>2.64(2)</sub> for single-crystal samples. The composition of polycrystalline (bulk) samples was established from 
 <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR investigations and is more B-rich, SiB
 <sub>2.93(7)</sub>. Next we analyze in more detail the structural/occupational disorder in α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> as well as the relative stability of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> with respect to β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> by theoretical calculations.
