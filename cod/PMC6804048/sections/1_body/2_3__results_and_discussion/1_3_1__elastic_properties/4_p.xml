<p>To determine whether a material is ductile or brittle, Cauchy pressures (C
 <sub>12</sub>–C
 <sub>44</sub> for cubic and C
 <sub>13</sub>–C
 <sub>44</sub> and C
 <sub>12</sub>–C
 <sub>66</sub> for tetragonal), Pugh’s [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] index of ductility (ratio of shear modulus over bulk modulus (G/B)) and Poisson’s ratio (ν) are taken into account. The values of the aforementioned properties are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03217-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. According to Pettifor [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], for metallic bonding, a positive value of Cauchy pressure indicates ductile material and a negative value indicates brittle behaviour. The other two conditions for a compound to be brittle are the G/B ratio to be greater than 0.57 and the ν less than 0.26. Regarding all the aforementioned criteria, the data in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03217-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> indicates that the Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al and Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si phases are the most and less ductile ones, respectively, amongst the intermetallics of the present study. All the ternary intermetallics are more ductile than the βNb
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub>.
