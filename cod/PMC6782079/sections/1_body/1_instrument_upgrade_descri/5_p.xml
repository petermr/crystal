<p>Finally, a 360° fine radial collimator was designed to provide full detector coverage with optimized structural column supports. The column supports were positioned to eliminate shadowing effects and align with the two fixed sample vessel support ribs. The fine radial collimator oscillates by ±2.00°. The blade foils are 12.5 µm-thick Kapton coated with boron carbide powder enriched to 96% 
 <sup>10</sup>B. The powder was mixed with a vacuum-compatible binder to achieve an areal density of B
 <sub>4</sub>C of 5.3 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The total coated blade thickness was 100 ± 10 µm. More details of the design can be found in the report by Huq &amp; Rennich (2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb50"> ▸</xref>). We have observed that this collimator is most effective in the 2Θ range 30–150° where the background is reduced by an order of magnitude. Slightly elevated background is observed in the data near the forward and backscattering angles.
