<p>As is known, the method of chemical synthesis is the simplest and most scalable method of obtaining various nanoscale particles by mixing the initial components of the solution, followed by initiating processes of particle coagulation. Also, in contrast to mechanical chemical synthesis or sol-gel methods, during chemical synthesis, the sizes of the resulting initial nanoparticles can be varied by changing the concentration of solutions or other external factors. However, the nanoparticles obtained by this method in most cases are X-ray amorphous, due to the small size or the presence in the structure of a considerable number of vacancy defects or areas of disorder. Moreover, reducing the concentration of defects in nanoparticles, as well as changing the phase composition, can be achieved by a relatively simple method of thermal annealing of the nanoparticles obtained in an inert or oxygen-containing medium. The combination of these two methods of synthesis allows to obtain nanoparticles with a high crystallinity degree and a given phase composition and structural and magnetic properties.
