 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor was pressed into a quarter inch diameter pellet by using a hydraulic press and then placed in a quartz ampule which was sealed under vacuum for post-heat treatment. The ampule was inserted into a furnace and heated from room temperature to 700 °C for 2.5 h, dwelled at 700 °C for 36 h, and cooled to room temperature over 2.5 h. After heating, the ampule was opened in the air and the pellet was removed. The pellet was ground in an agate mortar and pestle for several minutes to produce a powder. The powder was stored with a desiccant after grinding.
