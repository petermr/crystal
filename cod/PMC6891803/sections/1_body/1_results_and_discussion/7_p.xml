 </xref> shows the cross-sectional SEM analysis of the experimental VAN thin films for different deposition rates alongside the 3D view of the KMCS results with the same parameters. The formation of the LMO nanopillars within the LLTO matrix can be observed as they are connected to the underlying STO substrate and grow through the full thickness of the VAN film. The vertical pillars formed at 2 Hz exhibit a larger diameter compared to those grown at 8 Hz. However, for a deposition rate of 0.5 Hz, the LMO phase does not form vertical structures but grows in larger, three-dimensional agglomerates dispersed in the LLTO matrix. Notably, many LMO structures are not well-connected to the STO substrate and instead rest on a LLTO region in many locations.
