<p content-type="flushleft">A red blood cell, which happened to be invaded by 2 parasites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), was treated with BrQ drug 30 h after infection. The cell was nondestructively imaged by soft X-ray cryotomography with the photon energy within the so-called water window range in which oxygen atoms are practically transparent and carbon atoms are heavily absorbing. This generates strong contrast between lipid, cytoplasm, and hemozoin crystals (

 </xref>), enabling direct tomographic mapping of cellular structure within entire parasites without the need for staining.
