<p id="Par10">The adopted theoretical formalism, based on all-electron DFT
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, allows to access the energies of all the electrons in the core. Although core energies are systematically underestimated by 10–20% in DFT
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>, relative core shifts referred to the same levels in different materials can be correlated with XPS data in a meaningful way. The calculated core level energies of each state in all the investigated materials are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. We separate line by line the binding energies of states with different principal and angular quantum numbers 
 <italic>n</italic> and 
 <italic>l</italic>. Contributions from crystallographically inequivalent Cs atoms are identified by their site in the unit cell, according to the scheme in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The energies of Cs atoms on sites 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, which are equivalent to those on sites 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, are omitted. A colour code is adopted in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> to visualise the magnitude of core-level shifts with respect to Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb. In this way it is possible to catch at a glance the rather regular patterns that do not vary depending on the quantum numbers of core states but appear instead as a general property of atoms at specific sites. The relative shift of core levels of Cs atoms on site 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb compared to those in Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb amounts to 0.27 eV. The corresponding values in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> are marked in orange. The binding energies of the core states of Cs atoms on site 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> in CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb are shifted by −0.82 eV with respect to Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb and are highlighted in green in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. We recall that larger binding energies correspond to deeper levels. Binding energies of core levels associated to crystallographically inequivalent Cs atoms in Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb are always separated in energy by 0.87 eV, with states relative to atoms on site 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> being always energetically deeper. The core shifts associated to K and Sb atoms are also insensitive to the specific core state but appear once again as a general property of the atomic species in the specific compounds. The core binding energies of antimony atoms in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb increase with respect to those in Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb by different amounts of energies. In CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb, Sb binding energies are slightly larger by less than 0.1 eV compared to those in Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb (yellow boxes in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. On the other hand, the shifts between Sb core states in Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb and Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb is of the order of 0.5 eV (red boxes in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The most remarkable shifts in the binding energies of core levels appear between 1
 <italic>s</italic> and 2
 <italic>p</italic> states of potassium in the two considered bi-alkali antimonides. A close inspection of the blue boxes in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> reveals shifts larger than 2 eV, which are again almost constant regardless of the quantum numbers of core states. K states in Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb are deeper than those in CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb.
