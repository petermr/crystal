 <italic>x</italic> = 0.25, the volume contracts by 4.2% during the phase transition. Most interestingly, the volume contraction increases with increase in V content. The volume contraction value increases to 6.3% for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.50 and 8.4% for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.67. When 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1, the volume contracts by a value as large as 10.4% at the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition point. One of the main factors for volume contraction in this series of compounds at the phase transition is the change in bonding between Pb–O and Ti/V–O, which is discussed below. PTO-based composites with a high value of volume contraction during phase transition can give rise to interesting properties like high NTE. Moreover, a temperature-induced phase transition is observed experimentally for 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.3.
