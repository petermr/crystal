 <caption> Normalized PL spectra of GdVO 4:Dy 3+ (solid black line) and GdVO 4:Eu 3+ films (solid gray line) when illuminated at 295 nm; photoexcitation spectra attained while detecting at 572 nm (dashed black line) or 615 nm (dashed gray line). Pictures of the emission color of films illuminated at 295 nm are shown as insets. (b) FESEM image of a cross section of the layered phosphor coating made by the sequential deposition of GdVO 4:Dy 3 and GdVO 4:Eu 3 nanophosphor layers followed by sintering. (c) Ballistic transmittance spectrum of the layered phosphor coating. (d,e) Photographs of the same film under natural and UV light. </caption>
