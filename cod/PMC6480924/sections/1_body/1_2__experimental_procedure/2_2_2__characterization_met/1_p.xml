<p>The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded by X-ray powder diffraction (AXS D8 Advance, Bruker, Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany). The unit cell crystal structure of BiOCl was plotted by the VESTA program. Microstructure morphology was observed and studied by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss supra-55, Oberkochen, Germany). Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and excitation (PLE) spectra were characterized by a FL-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), using a 150 W Xe lamp as an excitation source. The operating voltage of the photomultiplier tube of the spectrophotometer was 400 V. Combining the same spectrophotometer with the self-made computer-controlled heating device, the PL spectra at different temperatures were tested. The decay behavior and lifetimes of PL were recorded by a time-resolved luminescence spectrometer (FS5, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd., Edinburgh, UK) combined with microsecond Xe flash and time-correlated single photon counter system. The quantum yield was characterized by an FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with an integrated sphere, and the absorption was measured with BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> powder as reference.
