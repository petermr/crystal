<p id="Par26">Surface X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the beamline BM25b of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble (France) using a six-circle UHV diffractometer. Samples were prepared 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> in the same way as in the LEED, STM, XPS and photoemission experiments. In total the integrated intensities of 2786 reflections were collected by performing scans along the reciprocal q
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>l</italic> × c* direction in reciprocal space and collecting the reflected beam by using a two-dimensional pixel detector. The I
 <sub>
  <italic>obs</italic>
 </sub>(hkl) were then multiplied by instrumental correction factors C
 <sub>
  <italic>corr</italic>
 </sub> as outlined in detail in refs.

 <sup>2</sup> were averaged according to the 
 <italic>p</italic>3 plane group symmetry of the (0001) surface leading to in total 1042 symmetry independent |F

 <sup>2</sup>. The total uncertainty (1 
 <italic>σ</italic>) is estimated by the quadrature sum of the statistical and the systematic error as outlined e.g. in ref.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>

 <sup>2</sup> is equal to 17%.
