<p>Heterogeneous catalytic reactions such as electrochemical water spitting are closely related to the surface electronic structures of the catalysts, such as the surface states and surface atomic termination (

Unlike the easily destroyable surface states derived from dangling bonds, vacancies, or doping, topological surface states (TSSs) are a result of the inversion of the bulk bands at the surface. Thus, they are robust against surface modifications and defects (

This could notably depress backscattering and Anderson localization of conduction electrons, which are imperative for materials that are always accompanied with, to some extent, surface defects (
