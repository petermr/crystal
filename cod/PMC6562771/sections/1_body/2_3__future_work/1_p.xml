<p>In this study, the influencing factors of surface topography of the diamond turned components and their corresponding models, as well as the modeling process have been reviewed and summarized. It can be seen that the influence of feed rate, material spring back and the harmonic form vibration between diamond tool and workpiece surface have been comprehensively studied. However, for the other influencing factors, such as tool edge waviness, material plastic side flow, rake angle, grain boundary and other defects in the work material matrix, the quantitative theoretical models are only preliminarily established. In terms of the current findings, we think that some essential future works need to attract more attention. </p>
