<p>Close examination of the individual signals shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref> indicates that upon 451 nm excitation of the infused PD for a period from 1.0 to 5.0 s, there is a rise of the NOA signal for several seconds, reflecting, in part, the response time of the apparatus shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00592/suppl_file/ao9b00592_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S1</ext-link>. This is followed by a decay of the signal that fits reasonably well to a single exponential decay function (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>). For example, the NOA signal decay subsequent to a 1.0 s irradiation of PetACrONO infused in a Med-6233 PD displayed an average lifetime (τ
 <sub>decay</sub>) of 17.0 ± 0.3 s (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>), and this was reproducible for subsequent 1 s excitations within the experimental uncertainty given. Similar decays were observed for the 2.5 and 5.0 s irradiation periods of the same sample, although the fits gave somewhat smaller values of τ
 <sub>decay</sub>, 14.1 ± 0.2 and 12.3 ± 0.1 s, respectively. As would be expected, these decay properties are a property of the specific silicone formulation utilized to prepare the PDs, although the differences in the calculated τ
 <sub>decay</sub> values are not dramatic. These data are presented in SI

 <sub>decay</sub> values ranging from 14 to 28 s with samples excited for 1.0 s and with similar ranges (∼12–22 and ∼11–19 s, respectively) for excitation times of 2.5 and of 5.0 s. A logical explanation for the decay lifetimes would be that they represent diffusion to the surface of the NO released by photoexcitation of PetACrONO at a collection of different accessible sites within the polymer matrix. Given the heterogeneity of these devices, there is no reason to expect strictly exponential decays, despite the apparent shapes of these curves.
