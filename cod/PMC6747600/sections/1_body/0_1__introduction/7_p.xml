<p>Similar results were obtained for RuSi and OsSi based on the study of transport properties [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The band gap of RuSi was estimated as 0.26 eV above 400 K, while activation energy at 150 K was 20 meV [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The resistivity of OsSi is typical for a degenerate semiconductor, showing intrinsic semiconducting behavior only above 1000 K, thus the band gap was estimated to be larger than 0.26 eV [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The magnetic susceptibility of both materials is negative, down to 5 K [
