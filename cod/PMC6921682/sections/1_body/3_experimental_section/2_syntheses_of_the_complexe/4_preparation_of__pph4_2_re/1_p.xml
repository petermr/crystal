 <bold>Method 1:</bold> Him (177 mg, 2.59 mmol) and 
 <bold>1</bold> (100 mg, 0.102 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>, followed by addition of a 10 mL layer of Et
 <sub>2</sub>O. The solution was left for several days, resulting in the formation of yellow crystals, which were filtered and washed with Et
 <sub>2</sub>O. Yield: 102 mg (89.1%). Anal. Calcd for C
