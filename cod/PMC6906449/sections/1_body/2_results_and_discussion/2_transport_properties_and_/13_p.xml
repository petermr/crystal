 <sub>m</sub> plays a minor role. The fitted

 <sub>L,F</sub> values are roughly in accordance with the experimentally determined

 <sub>L</sub> values, except for those at high temperatures, which are about 30–60% higher than the measured ones at 814 K (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The origin for the high estimated 
 <italic>κ</italic>
 <sub>L,F</sub> values is due to the fact that the extra phonon scattering on the distorted crystal structure is not taken into account. This distortion, which is caused by the different interactions between the bonds Ag-Te and In-Te and represented by the higher anion position parameter 
 <italic>u</italic> (
 <italic>u</italic> ≈ 0.258 &gt; 0.25, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>), has a profound impact on the lattice part

 </sup>. However, the phonon scattering on the increased phase boundaries due to the presence of the impurity phases (AgTe
 <sub>3</sub> and Te) should play a minor role, as it acts only at low to middle temperatures.
