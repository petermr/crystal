<p id="Par7">Thermal constraints on slowly cooled paleo lava flows cannot rely upon conventional chemical geothermometry based on intercrystalline cation exchange because at low temperature (below 600–700 °C) long-range diffusion is kinetically hindered. Conversely, the short range of intracrystalline exchange reaction can proceed to much lower temperatures (i.e. about 500 °C, see

 </sup> for further details) thus allowing it to be used to estimate the cooling history for complex magma bodies that may have interacted with one another.
