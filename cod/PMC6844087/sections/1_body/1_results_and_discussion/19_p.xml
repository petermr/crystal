<p>These results clearly show how the saturation magnetization (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>S</sub>), i.e., the maximum magnetization that can be achieved by the material, increases as the thermal treatment becomes stronger. Also, by examining the inner plot, it is seen how the magnetic permeability (μ, which corresponds to the slope of the first magnetization curve) is also dependent on the thermal treatment. For both commented magnetic properties, when the sample is prepared at 750 °C, there is a strong dependence on the treatment time, whereas it is weaker or inexistent when the sample is prepared at 950 °C. Additionally, the remanent magnetization (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>) and the coercive field (
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>C</sub>) have the same increasing tendency at stronger calcination conditions, except in the case of sample #1. All of the quantitative results are summarized in
