 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>a), this sample corresponded to almost pure α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>. At these conditions, α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> was afforded as facetted crystals with sizes of up to 10 μm. At the same time, one can note more irregularly shaped crystals with a smaller size. Interestingly, their different contrast suggests a different composition, with the larger crystals more rich in Si (i.e., larger crystals appear brighter in the micrograph). A closer look at the larger crystals reveals heterogeneities in the presence of boron-rich inclusions and sporadic Si nanocrystals. We infer that the crystal growth of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> is accompanied with a change to a more Si-rich composition. This is corroborated by single-crystal diffraction studies and discussed in more detail in 
 <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="other">Section 
  <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="other">3.2</xref>
 </xref>. It is not clear whether sizable (&gt;10 μm) homogeneous α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystals can be grown in solid-state reaction mixtures. On the other hand, Magnusson and Brosset discovered that α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystals can be grown in Si–B melts using excess of Si,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
 </sup> i.e., at temperatures considerably above the decomposition into SiB
 <sub>6</sub> and Si. Here, one can think that—analogous to α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> formation from boron-supersaturated Si particles in the solid state—α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> nuclei precipitate from boron-supersaturated Si-rich liquid solutions by following Ostwald’s rule of stages (which postulates that a supersaturated system does not spontaneously transform into the most stable of all possible states (i.e., SiB
 <sub>6</sub> + Si) but rather into the state which is the next more stable compared to the supersaturated state). In our synthesis of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystal samples (according to Magnusson and Brosset), we used a Si/B ratio close to the eutectic composition (∼92 atom % of Si) and heated to temperatures just slightly above the eutectic temperature (∼1385 °C).

 </sup> Melts were equilibrated for a relatively short time (1 h), to minimize decomposition into SiB
 <sub>6</sub>, after which the sample was cooled by switching off the furnace. After removal of excess Si, black α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystals were obtained with sizes from several micrometers to 200 μm (see
