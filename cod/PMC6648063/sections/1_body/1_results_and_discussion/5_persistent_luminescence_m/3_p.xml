<p>We propose a persistent luminescence mechanism for BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>. After Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is activated by the light source, electrons transition from the ground state 4f orbital to the 5d orbital and become excited electrons. Then, they are captured by the electron trap. The captured electrons are activated again to the 5d orbital of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion under the action of temperature. The electrons in the 5d orbital transition to the 4f orbital and generate yellow persistent luminescence. According to the discussion above, the intensity of persistent luminescence excited by a 460 nm light source is higher than the intensity excited by a 254 nm light source. Besides, the energy of a 460 nm light source is lower than the conduction band. This indicates that the captured excited electrons do not transmit by the conduction band but may directly transmit from the 5d orbital to deflect the energy level by the tunneling effect. Also, by thermal activation, the captured electrons directly transmit to the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> luminescence center without passing the conduction band. Thus, the sample irradiated under the light source with lower energy can generate stronger persistent luminescence.
