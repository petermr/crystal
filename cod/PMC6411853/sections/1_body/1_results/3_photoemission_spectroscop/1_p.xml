<p id="Par16">Owing to their very similar atomic number, X-ray diffraction is not capable to separate the atomic species iodine (Z = 53) and tellurium (Z = 52). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy was used to analyze the chemical composition of the film. All photoemission spectroscopy experiments were carried out at the NanoESCA beamline
