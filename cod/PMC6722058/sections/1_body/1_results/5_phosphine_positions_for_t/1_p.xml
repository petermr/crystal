<p id="Par22">Predicting Ag–P interface for the clusters with mixed ligand layers of thiolates and phospines or thiolates and diphosphines was done by starting from one of the correctly predicted partial structures based on the Ag-S interface predictions. Both Ag-atom and S-atom positions are included when describing the local environments for the phosphorus atoms. To accomplish this, atom types were also included the nearest neighbor description when searching the possible interface atom positions. The parameters used in prediction of Ag–P interface are given in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. For all clusters we used systematically four nearest neighbors with 0.1–0.2 Å error limits for the distances and 10 degrees limit for the angles. One of the clusters have diphosphines instead of phosphines for which the single P atoms are added in pairs by restricting the distance to a range of 5.0–5.5 Å based on the length of the carbon chain between the phosphine ends in the molecule (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The spatial fitting of the organic groups (e.g., triphenyl) were done by one large spherical probe in parallel direction to the nearest neighbor Ag–P bond.
