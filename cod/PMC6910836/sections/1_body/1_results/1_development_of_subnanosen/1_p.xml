<p>SERS is a powerful analytical technique capable of providing fingerprint information regarding target substances. The vibrational signals associated with SERS are greatly enhanced in the presence of Au or Ag nanoparticles, which work as optical amplifiers. Shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) (

The presence of these silica shells inhibits chemical and electrical interactions between target molecules and the optical amplifiers such that only the intrinsic characteristics of the target molecules are assessed. This configuration also allows using any type of substrates in terms of shapes and materials, providing extensive applicability of this technique to interfacial analyses. However, even the conventional SHINERS method, in which Au nanoparticles with a diameter of 55 nm are used, cannot “sense” the presence of SNCs under such a low surface density condition.
