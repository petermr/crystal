<p id="p0050">Micro X-ray fluorescence analysis (microXRFA) was performed on the M4 TORNADO microfluorescence spectrometer (Bruker) [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The source of the primary X-ray radiation was a low-power conventional X-ray tube (XRT) (30W) with a rhodium anode. It used the X-ray tube mode: U = 50kV, I = 300 μA. The microXRFA M4 TORNADO consisted of polycapillary lens (IFG Institute for Scientific Instruments [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) used for focusing the primary radiation of the XRT into the spot diameter of 25 μm on a surface of the sample. Vacuum chamber of the micro-fluorescence spectrometer made it possible to do a quantitative analysis under pressure of 20 mbar and collect data for chemical elements beginning from 11Na. An energy dispersive detector with 4096 channels records and separates the energy of quanta with an energy resolution of 140 eV in the range of 1–40 keV. The use of M4 TORNADO at the “Multipoint” mode allowed us a statistically reliable collection of average intensities of X-ray fluorescence lines and to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the concentrations of the main chemical elements (11Na, 20Ca, 41Nb) contained in the studied ceramic samples.
