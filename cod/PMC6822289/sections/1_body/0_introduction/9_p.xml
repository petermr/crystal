<p>Whereas the optimization of a single structure can be seen as a routine DFT calculation, the optimization of over 300 hundred structures, including both 2- and 3-dimensional topologies, is particularly challenging. For a single structure, one can develop a recipe that is tailor-made and optimized for a given material. For such a large number of structures, the challenge is to build a workchain that is sufficiently general and robust such that any COF structure can be optimized. Moreover, given the number of calculations, one cannot afford to manually check all the outputs and ensure that all the calculations proceeded correctly. Therefore, it is important for the workchain not only to print out just the important values that the user needs to monitor but also to automatically act when a known problem is encountered. Our aim is to shift the attention from the single calculation to the inner logic of the workchain that, performing multiple calculations and tests, can chose automatically the most efficient path that leads to the solution (in this case the optimized geometry), and which can be extended to identify more problems and improve its robustness.</p>
