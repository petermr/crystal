<p>A three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulation was used to compute the electromagnetic field distribution and the enhancement characteristics of the hotspots, based on various materials and structural configurations (

 </xref>). The enhancement properties of model gaps between two Ag core SHINs located on smooth Si surfaces were compared while varying the core size (
