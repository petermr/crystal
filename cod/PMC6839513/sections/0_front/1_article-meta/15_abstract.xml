 <p>Understanding the behavior and properties of molecules assembled in thin layers requires knowledge of their crystalline packing. The drug phenytoin (5,5-diphenylhydantoin) is one of the compounds that can be grown as a surface induced polymorph. By using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, the monoclinic unit cell of the new 
  <bold>form II</bold> can be determined, but, due to crystal size and the low amount of data, a full solution using conventional structure solving strategies fails. In this work, the full solution has been obtained by combining computational structure generation and experimental results. The comparison between the bulk and the new surface induced phase reveals significant packing differences of the hydrogen-bonding network, which might be the reason for the faster dissolution of 
  <bold>form II</bold> with respect to 
  <bold>form I</bold>. The results are very satisfactory, and the method might be adapted for other systems, where, due to the limited amount of experimental data, one must rely on additional approaches to gain access to more detailed information to understand the solid-state behavior.
