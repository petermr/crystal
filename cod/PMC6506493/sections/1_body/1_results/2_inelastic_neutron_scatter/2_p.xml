<p id="Par11">The contour maps of inelastic neutron scattering sliced along the 
 <italic>L</italic> direction are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref> represent integrated intensities around (
 <italic>H</italic>, 
 <italic>K</italic>) = (2, 0) [and (0, 2) from different domains] and (1, 0) [and (0, 1)], respectively. The excitations along 
 <italic>L</italic> is dispersionless, irrespective of 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic>, attesting to the good two-dimensionality in the dimer network. In addition, integrated intensities are modulated along 
 <italic>L</italic>, as should be the case for antiferromagnetically coupled dimers along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref> show energy-integrated intensities from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>, respectively. The intensity of perfectly aligned antiferromagnetic dimers can be described by a dimer structure factor 
 <italic>I</italic>(

 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>Q</italic>)|
 <sup>2</sup>[1 − cos(
 <bold>Q</bold> · 
 <bold>r</bold>
 <sub>d</sub>)], where 
 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>Q</italic>) and 
 <bold>r</bold>
 <sub>d</sub> indicate a form factor of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and a vector representing intradimer separation, respectively. In Ba
 <sub>2</sub>CuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>, there are four types of dimers with slightly different orientations, and hence the dimer structure factor should be corrected for this dimer misalignment. However, since their canting angle of 0.9° from the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis is very small, we approximate that all the four dimers are aligned along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, the fit to this equation yields an 
 <bold>r</bold>
 <sub>d</sub> of 0.150(1)
 <bold>c</bold>, which is consistent with 0.148(1)
 <bold>c</bold> obtained from the crystal structure. The modulation along 
 <italic>L</italic> does not depend on 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic>, further supporting the approximation of the equivalent dimers.
