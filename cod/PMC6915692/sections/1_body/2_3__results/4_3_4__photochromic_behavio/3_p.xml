<p>The photochromism analysis was extended to two representative compounds elaborated at different temperatures and different atmospheres, for which a drastic change of the chemical, structural, morphological and optical properties was observed, i.e., the samples placed in both sides of the border delimiting the two samples series defined by the drastic change of physico-chemical properties: the first sample is the sub-micronic monoclinic compound with the more intense near infrared absorption (and lowest L* parameter, in the monoclinic series). The second sample is the pseudo-cubic NP with the more saturated blue coloration (lowest b*parameter in the pseudo-cubic series) (
