<p>Diffuse absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature from 200 to 2000 nm on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa-Clara, CA, USA) using an integration sphere (spectral resolution: 1 nm and band length: 2 nm). Halon was used as the white reference. RGB space colorimetric parameters were determined from the spectra using a two-step mathematic treatment. The first step consists in extracting the XYZ tri-stimulus values (defined by the CIE, 1964) from the integration (over the visible range, i.e., from λ = 380 up to 780 nm) of the product of x(λ), y(λ) or z(λ) functions (CIE–1964) with the diffuse reflectance spectra function X = ∫ x(λ).R(λ)dλ. Then, we used the transfer equations defined by the CIE, 1976, to transform the XYZ space to the L*, a* and b* common three-color space parameters.</p>
