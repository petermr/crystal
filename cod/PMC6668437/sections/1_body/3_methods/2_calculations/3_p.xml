 </sup>. We treated the Yb 4f states as core states to remove their bands from the Fermi level. From the DFT results a minimum basis Wannier function model was extracted, which then was mapped onto the finite and semi-infinite slab geometries. The canting was introduced into the mapped model via auxiliary staggered magnetic fields at the Mn atoms in such a way that a 10Â° canting angle was obtained. The surface spectral functions were calculated via Greens function techniques. Following the procedures employed in ref.
