<p>A 0.22 THz multi-channel imaging radar system with interferometric inverse aperture synthesis technique was developed in this paper. The system structure and its potential applications were detailed presented and discussed. To overcome the non-ideal factors in the radar system, an effective calibration method was presented to obtain a successful image. Besides, an InISAR image scaling method was proposed to solve the phase wrapping problem, and the target rotation rate, which is essential in LA InISAR imaging, was estimated in the meantime. The imaging performance of the radar system and the validity of the imaging processing method were verified experimentally. The imaging results showed that the radar system can achieve high-quality 3-D imaging of complex targets with centimeter-scale resolution in range and azimuth. Until now, all experiments were carried out in laboratory environment, but the work in this paper can provide support to the remote application of terahertz InISAR imaging systems in the future.</p>
