<p>The IR spectra of undoped Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) sample and specimens doped with 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Figure S3</xref>. The given IR spectra contain several absorption bands in the range of 400–1100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The three sharp absorption bands in the range of 650–450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be assigned to the PO
 <sub>4</sub> bending vibrations. Strong absorption band at 900–700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> originates from the Mo-O stretching vibrations in MoO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedrons, whereas strong absorption bands at 950 and 1050 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be assigned to symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of PO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedrons, respectively [
