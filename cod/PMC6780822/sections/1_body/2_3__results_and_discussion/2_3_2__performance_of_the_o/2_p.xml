<p>In the previous study, employing a scattering layer to OLED devices as a layer or film coated on outer surface of the glass substrate reported enhanced light efficiency of OLEDs [

However, the distance from the light emitting layer to the scattering layer was very long, including the thickness of the glass substrate 0.5 mm compared to the pixel pitch 80 Î¼m. Therefore, the light scatter effect caused mixing colors among pixels and led to image blur on the display screen. In this work, we implemented the scattering layer on the inner surface of the glass substrate. The distance from the light emitting layer to the scattering layer was short, about half of the pixel pitch, so a good image quality without image blur could be achieved by the proposed method. The emitted light at the OLED device between the anode electrode and the cathode electrode propagated to various directions while it passed the scattering layer. The scattered light changed the direction of propagation through the glass substrate, which limited the total internal reflection. Therefore, the light from the OLED substrate wave guided mode could be extracted, which enhanced the light efficiency of the OLED device.
