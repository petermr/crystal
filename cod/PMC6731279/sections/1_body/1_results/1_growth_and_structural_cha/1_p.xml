<p id="Par6">Single-crystal films of CHO were deposited on STO substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Details are described in Methods. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the growth and the structural characterizations of CHO/STO of both terminations. The growth was accurately controlled by in situ monitoring reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) intensity oscillations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). The S-STO was obtained by inserting a single unit cell (uc) of SrO on T-STO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The relatively fast decay of the RHEED intensity oscillations for depositing CHO on S-STO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) indicates that the growth deviated slightly from a perfect layer-by-layer mode. However, this imperfection does not affect the quality of CHO significantly. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the surface of CHO/STO of both terminations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>) show the steps and terraces of the original substrate surface, indicating high-quality growth. The high quality of the CHO films can also be appreciated from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) finite-thickness oscillations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). The XRD data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) reveal epitaxial growth and very high crystallinity. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images reveal that the CHO films are coherent with the STO substrates for both terminations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>), and the two types of heterointerfaces can be distinguished by the atomic-scale energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i, j</xref>).
