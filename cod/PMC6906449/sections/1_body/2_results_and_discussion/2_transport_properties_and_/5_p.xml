<p id="Par18">Combined with the above three parameters (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>σ</italic>, 
 <italic>κ</italic>), we obtain the ZT values shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. The ZT values, which are less than 0.2 for all the samples below 700 K, rapidly increase with the increase of the temperature. At 814 K the ZT value reaches 0.55 for the sample at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.15. This value is about 1.8 times that of the pristine AgInTe
