 </xref>c describes the effects of thermal quenching on the far-red emission of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> qualitatively. Once Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> is excited from the 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> ground state to the 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) state, energy will go through a fast NR process to populate the lowest energy point of the 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F). Basically, the energy in 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) excited state radiatively decays to the 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> ground state by efficiently yielding far-red photons at room/lower temperature. However, in the case of an elevated temperature, the absorbed energy in 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) excited state is feasibly promoted to the intersystem crossing (Q) of 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) excited state and 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> ground state by thermal activation (T-activation) and then is quenched by fast nonradiative decay to the bottom of 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> ground state. Typically, the temperature-dependent fluorescence intensity can be expressed as

Accordingly, a higher temperature will thermally promote more excited ions to easily reach the level crossing Q, and meanwhile, the stronger NR process happens. On the assumption that the photon absorption and scattering of luminescent sample keep constant in the temperature region,
