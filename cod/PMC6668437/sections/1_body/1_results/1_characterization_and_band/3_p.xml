<p id="Par8">In the YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> compound we see no strong magnetism between 50 and 300 K, however, below 50 K new features in the magnetization develop. We show MH curves for YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>. The behavior above 20,000 Oe should be all bulk effects and the curves for 300, 200, 100, and 50 K only show a very weak either diamagnetic or weak paramagnetic response to the field above 20,000 Oe. This implies the spins are locked in possibly perfect AFM order, as in EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>. However, as we get to low temperature, the magnetic response picks up and becomes significantly more anisotropic signaling some new spin degrees of freedom. This would be a disruption of perfect antiferromagnetism due to, e.g., canting and is an evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking in YbMnBi
