<p id="p0095">Quantum mechanics soon led to the development of atomic and nuclear physics. Quantum mechanics was also the basis for molecular physics, which rapidly developed in two directions. The first was associated with the theory of the structure of molecules and solids, which was based on the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic approximation [

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The adiabatic approximation, in which the motion of light electrons quickly adapts to the slow motion of heavy nuclei and which often perfectly describes the stationary (ground) state of molecular systems, is in full compliance with the principles of quantum mechanics. The Franck-Condon principle assumes that during optical excitation of a molecule, a light electron makes a fast quantum jump (transition) to an excited state, and then the whole configuration of heavy nuclei in the molecular system slowly adapts to the new distribution of the electron charge in the excited state. This assumption leads in many cases to a good agreement between theoretical and experimental results of molecular optical spectra.
