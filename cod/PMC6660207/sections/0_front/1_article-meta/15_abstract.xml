 <p>The hybrid nature and soft lattice of organolead halide perovskites render their structural changes and optical properties susceptible to external driving forces such as temperature and pressure, remarkably different from conventional semiconductors. Here, we investigate the pressure-induced optical response of a typical two-dimensional perovskite crystal, phenylethylamine lead iodide. At a moderate pressure within 3.5 GPa, its photoluminescence red-shifts continuously, exhibiting an ultrabroad energy tunability range up to 320 meV in the visible spectrum, with quantum yield remaining nearly constant. First-principles calculations suggest that an out-of-plane quasi-uniaxial compression occurs under a hydrostatic pressure, while the energy is absorbed by the reversible and elastic tilting of the benzene rings within the long-chain ligands. This anisotropic structural deformation effectively modulates the quantum confinement effect by 250 meV via barrier height lowering. The broad tunability within a relatively low pressure range will expand optoelectronic applications to a new paradigm with pressure as a tuning knob.</p>
