<p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were identified using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range of 10–80°. The morphologies of the samples were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; TESCAN MAIA3). The PL and PLE spectra, as well as the decay curves, of the as-obtained phosphors were plotted using an Edinburgh FS5 spectrometer equipped with a 150 W continued-wavelength xenon lamp and a pulsed xenon lamp, respectively. The IQE values of the BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> samples were measured using an Edinburgh FS5 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere coated with BaSO
 <sub>4</sub>.
