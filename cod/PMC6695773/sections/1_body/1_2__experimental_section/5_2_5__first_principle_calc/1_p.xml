<p>The formation enthalpy of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn was calculated using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with standard potential function [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-02484" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All the structures were fully relaxed with respect to volume and the atomic coordinates. A cutoff of 360 eV was used for all elements. The settings of k-points correspond roughly to a 5000 k-point mesh per reciprocal atom. The formation enthalpy (with thermal contributions and zero-vibration energy difference or contribution being ignored) for an equilibrium phase Ti
 <sub>x</sub>Sn
 <sub>y</sub> can be defined as [

 <disp-formula>ΔH (Ti
  <sub>x</sub>Sn

  <sub>x</sub>Sn
  <sub>y</sub>) − x
  <sub>Ti</sub>·E(Ti) − y
  <sub>Sn</sub>·E(Sn)
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where E(Ti
 <sub>x</sub>Sn
 <sub>y</sub>) is the total energy of Ti
 <sub>x</sub>Sn
 <sub>y</sub> phase per atom, obtained by first-principle calculations. E(Ti) and E(Sn) are the energy for the pure elements Ti and Sn, respectively. x
 <sub>Ti</sub> = x\(x + y) and y
 <sub>Sn</sub> = y\(x + y) are the fractional compositions of Ti and Sn, respectively.
