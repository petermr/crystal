<p>Theoretical calculations show that the electronic structure of the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> host is also significantly modified by the Eu dopant. While the GGA-PBE approximated electronic band dispersion of the host material has a bandgap of 3.83 eV, some midgap states emerge after the interstitial doping of Eu. The energy bandgap of the host at the vicinity of doped region increases to 4.28 eV. The band and orbital decomposed charge density presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> shows that the midgap state is formed by strongly hybridized Eu and surrounding the O atoms. It appears that the strongly bonded Eu atoms not only lead to deformation in the lattice structure but also to emergence of defect-like states resulting in additional peaks in the PL spectrum.
