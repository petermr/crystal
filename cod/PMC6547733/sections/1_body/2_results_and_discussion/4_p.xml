<p id="Par13">The response of the monoclinic layered perovskite compounds to electronic excitation and the variations of the amorphization temperature with respect to 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition are very different than those of cubic pyrochlore compounds. The evolution of the RDF features for monoclinic LTO at 300 K for three excitation concentrations is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>. As for the cubic compounds, the formation of O–O bonds is maintained, but at an excitation concentration of 0.8%, which is lower than the 1.2% determined for the cubic lattice. Although 0.4% excitation concentration is not enough to have created O–O bonds in the crystal, the RDF features have been slightly affected compared to monoclinic LTO without electronic excitation (0%). At 0.4% electronic excitation, no Ti–O or La–O bonds have been broken, but their distances have varied by 0.1–0.2 Å on average, resulting in a slightly broadened and less intense RDF short-range peak for Ti–O. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>, the transition temperature tends to decrease in each monoclinic Z-LTO compound as the excitation concentration increases. Interestingly, the monoclinic layered perovskite lattice is most resistant to electronic excitation when the chemical mixing in the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site is the highest, which is obtained for 50% of Zr fraction. This is in contrast to the cubic pyrochlore lattice, for which the most vulnerable compound is obtained for a 50% [Zr, Ti] mixing. For 1.2% of excitation concentration and above, the transition temperature is composition independent and all the monoclinic compounds are readily amorphized below room temperature.
