  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub> obtained from single-crystal XRD and the Kagome lattice structure constructed by Co atoms in the 
   <italic>a</italic>-
   <italic>b</italic> plane. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The 3D BZ projected in the (001) direction. Three pairs of nodal lines are shown in the first BZ. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Band structure of Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub> in a paramagnetic state without the consideration of SOC effect. The band linear crossing near the Fermi energy can be found around the point L. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Band structure of Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub> with the inclusion of SOC effect. The band linear crossing is open, resulting in the band gap. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The nontrivial surface states on (001) facet of Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub> crystal with Sn termination, which is not fully occupied and located just above the Fermi level. (
   <bold>F</bold>) The contribution of Co atoms to the nontrivial surface states shown in (E). Nearly all the states originate from the surface Co Kagome layer.
