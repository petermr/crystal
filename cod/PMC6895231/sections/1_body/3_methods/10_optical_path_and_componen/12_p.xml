 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>. Spectrograph design is covered by the patent of Technical University of Denmark (application number PCT/DK2019/050027). Unique protected feature of the spectrograph design consists in combination of low NA collimation lens with high NA focusing lens. Focusing lens is a double-gauss type lens which consists of six spherical elements. It is corrected on coma, astigmatism and spherical aberration in the entire focal plane equal to the size of CCD (30 mm). The quality of objective can be verified by MTF curves (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10E</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">F</xref>). Point spread function adjusted to the size of CCD pixel (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10C</xref>). Spectrograph stray light parameters were optimized using nonsequential analysis mode in Zemax Optics Studio 17. It was experimentally verified that stray light level at wavenumber shift of 30 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> from laser line was at the level of 2.1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> which is very good result taking into account relatively small spectrograph dimensions and focal lengths. Spectrograph inside view is shown in Supplementary Fig.
