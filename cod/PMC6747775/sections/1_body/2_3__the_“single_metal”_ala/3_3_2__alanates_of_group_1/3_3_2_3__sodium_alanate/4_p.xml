<p>Reactions (25) and (26) account for 5.6 wt.% of reversible hydrogen storage. Uncatalyzed NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> experiences a solid to liquid phase transition before dehydrogenation. Meanwhile, in catalyzed NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, the dehydrogenation temperature is generally lower than the melting point [
 <xref rid="B117-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The first dehydrogenation step occurs at 210–220 °C. Meanwhile, the second step occurs at approximately 250 °C [
