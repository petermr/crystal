<p id="Par5">Arsenic has five valence electrons. Fundamentally, the number of bonds for covalent substances is 8-
 <italic>N</italic>, where 
 <italic>N</italic> is the ordinal number of the Periodic Group, e.g. 8-5 = 3 for As. Each atom in arsenic polymorphs is in three-fold coordination as expected for the covalent bonding with electronic configuration

 <italic>s</italic>-orbital is fully occupied with two electrons and does not contribute to cohesion. The cohesion is dominated by the half-filled 
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals. The group-V element As in its crystalline structure can be simply explained as the results of Peierls distortion of 
 <italic>p</italic>-bonded atoms. The six lobes of the 
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals lead to a simple cubic structure. Simple cubic to A7 distortion removes 
 <italic>p</italic> orbital degeneracy and results in the formation of three saturated nearest-neighbor bonds. Doubling of the periodicity in the three principal directions of the simple cubic structure can be achieved by the alternation of short covalent bonds and long van der Waals bonds. This leads to a layer structure of tri-coordinated covalent atoms. The reason group V elements are semiconductors or semimetals is due to a gap at the Fermi level opened by the doubling of periodicity. The electron configuration of As is 4
