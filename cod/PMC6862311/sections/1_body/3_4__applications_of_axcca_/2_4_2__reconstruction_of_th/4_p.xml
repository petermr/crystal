<p>The oscillations of the PDF in the Sm-A phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f011">Figure 11</xref>e) decay over few intermolecular distances, while in the Hex-B phase the magnitude of the peaks of the PDF stays almost constant over the same distance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f011">Figure 11</xref>h). This indicates the simultaneous increase of the positional correlation length

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f011">Figure 11</xref>e) gradually change into hexagonally arranged peaks in the Hex-B phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f011">Figure 11</xref>f–h), which is also an evidence of the coupling between the positional and BO orders. As a result of this coupling, the PDF decays at different rates in different directions (compare faster decay in the direction A and slower decay in the direction B in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f011">Figure 11</xref>h). In reference [
 <xref rid="B76-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] it was shown that for an unambiguous determination of the positional correlation length in such systems with angular anisotropy one has to consider the decay of the projection of the PDF onto the direction of the diffraction peaks (direction A). In this case, the results obtained by measuring the width of the diffraction peaks in the radial direction, and analysis of the PDF in real space will give similar values of the positional correlation length
