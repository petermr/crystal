 </sup> In the lattice of BASO, AlO
 <sub>4</sub> and Al/SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra form a three-dimensional network structure by means of a sharing vertex. Along the direction of the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis, a three-dimensional network structure of AlO
 <sub>4</sub> and Al/SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra forms two kinds of channels. In the lattice, there are three kinds of Ba lattice sites. There are two lattice sites, Ba(1) and Ba(3), which occupy completely in channel 2. Channel 1 is occupied by the Ba(2) lattice site, which consists of a six-membered ring formed by six Al/SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. The Ba(1) lattice site in channel 2 and Ba(1) or Ba(3) lattice sites in channel 1 can be connected by either the Al/SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedron or the O atom directly (Ba–O–Ba). The coordination number of the Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> ion and oxygen atom in channel 2 is 9. The ionic radius is 0.142 nm. The ionic radii of eight-coordinated Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> are 0.125 and 0.0994 nm, respectively. The ionic radii of nine-coordinated Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> are 0.13 and 0.1052 nm, respectively. In the lattice of BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, the ionic radius of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is close to Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ba
 <sup>2+</sup>. Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions tend to substitute the lattice site of Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> in the matrix.
