<p id="Par29">In this work, we have obtained a bright green emission zeolite-3A: Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor with a quantum yield of about 36.6% and the emission peak located at 523 nm through a green and eco-friendly high-thermal reaction method without any reducing atmosphere. In addition, the sample has a broad excitation band in the range of 310–450 nm, which can be corresponded to the commercial UV-chip excitation (actually, 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 375 nm). Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions can be gradually incorporated in the zeolite host lattices as the calcination temperature increases. Our research shows that the optimum sintering temperature is 1400 °C and the best doping concentration of Eu ions is 1.3%. Making use of the green-emitting zeolite-3A: Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor encapsulated on a UV-emitting chip, a good green LED with the Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates at (0.295, 0.537) and brightness of 231.6 cd/m
 <sup>2</sup> is obtained. And the green emission zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphors with increasing luminescent properties will be promising applications for lighting and display.
