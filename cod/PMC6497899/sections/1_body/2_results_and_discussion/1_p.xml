<p id="Par36">Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite was synthesized according to the previous approach with little modification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The Abs and PL spectra of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, the sharp Abs peak at around 375 nm could be assigned to the transitions from the defect band (caused by Bi doping) to the host conduction band minimum, which is in good accordance with previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The XRD pattern also indicates the formation of Sn-based perovskite (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). All the diffraction peaks matched well with the Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> crystal structure (ICSD #9023), and no impurity phases were detected, which is in good accordance with a previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> can be excited by UV light (365 nm) and exhibits bright blue light with the PL emission peak located at 465 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> is 65 nm, and the QY of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> is up to 76%. The PL excitation (PLE) spectrum of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> has been measured (detected at 465 nm) and shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. A broad peak located at 350 nm can be observed in the PLE spectrum of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub>, which shifts slightly compared to the Abs spectrum. The similar variation was observed by a previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, this Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> shows excellent stability. After being irradiated for 300 h with UV light, the PL intensity is nearly constant. The perovskite powder can maintain its QY after being exposed to air for 3 months (25 °C, relative humidity 35–50%).
