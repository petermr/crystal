 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> show the color coordinates and chromaticity diagrams of the NaAlSi
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>: Eu, x%Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> (x = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) respectively. With the increase of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration, the color coordinates change from (0.3894, 0.3834) to (0.5033, 0.373) which corresponds to the color change of green-yellow to orange under the ultraviolet radiation of 254 nm. It is found that when the concentration of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> is higher, the color of the sample is closer to the red emission (615 nm). The increasing concentration of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> will transfer energy to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, which will increase the emission peak at 615 nm. These results show that the obtained samples exhibit the advantages of polychromatic emission in the visible region and have potential applications in the field of solid illumination.
