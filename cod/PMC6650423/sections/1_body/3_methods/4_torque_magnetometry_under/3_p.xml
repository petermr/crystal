<p id="Par35">As we see in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>, in-plane anisotropy is absent at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 240 K (&gt;
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup>) and the torque amplitude shows symmetric behaviour in the (
 <italic>θ</italic>, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) plane. This indicates that 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 90° correctly captures the direction of the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane of the crystal. Otherwise, the response of the torque will be distorted in the (
 <italic>θ</italic>, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) plane as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9g</xref>. The emergence of the in-plane anisotropy below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup> is clearly seen at 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 90°. As a result, the torque response becomes asymmetric in the (
 <italic>θ</italic>, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) plane. It should be noted that this deformation of the torque amplitude in the (
 <italic>θ</italic>, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) plane below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup> is essentially different from the simple distortion expected for the case when the sample plane is misidentified. The excellent agreement of the observed torque amplitude with the expected response strongly supports that neither field misalignment nor mount misalignment is the reason for the observed onset of the twofold oscillations, which represents the emergence of the diagonal nematicity below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup>.
