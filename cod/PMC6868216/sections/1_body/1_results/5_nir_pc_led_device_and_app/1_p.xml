 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor and the commercial blue light-emitting InGaN chip (460 nm). The emission spectrum of the lighted lamp was monitored by a visible-NIR continuous fiber spectrophotometer. The broad-band PL spectrum and the as-obtained and lighted NIR pc-LED lamps are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. The slight spectral deviation from the lamp and the powder is related with the calibration difference of the used spectrometers. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> demonstrates the PL spectra of LED device upon different forward bias currents (20–120 mA). The NIR emission output power increase with the increase of forward currents and reaches 21.5 mW when the forward current is 100 mA (Supplementary Table

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> shows the photographs obtained by different cameras under natural light and NIR pc-LED light, respectively. Nothing can be detected by NIR camera once the NIR pc-LED is off. In contrast, the NIR camera can capture black-and-white images while the NIR pc-LED lamp is lighted. These results indicate the application of the K
