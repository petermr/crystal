<p>As a final comment to the found 
 <italic>Pc</italic> structure 10*, it is necessary to add that, since from the saddle one may go down in two different directions (i.e., one may freely select the + or â€“ sign for the perturbation), two distinct minima can be generated. However, the two optimized structures, which at first sight appeared to display opposite rotations of the phenyls, are actually identical but for a shift of the origin. Thus, the 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic> saddle structure may be described as an average of two shifted, but otherwise identical, 
 <italic>Pc</italic> minima (zero-point and thermal motion average over symmetrically equivalent lower symmetry structures, as seen for racemic naproxene
