<p>To assess the relative thermodynamic stability of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> and α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> we computed their energies of formation with respect to α-B
 <sub>12</sub> and Si. The results, shown in 
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>
 </xref>, reveal that, despite being stable with respect to the elemental phases, the predicted ground state of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the reaction 6(α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub>) = 5(β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>) + Si, with an enthalpy difference of 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 19.17 meV/atom. We additionally find that the arrangement of Si
 <sup>p</sup> atoms on the same polar triangle of the most stable σ of α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> is favored (by ∼7 meV/atom) over distributing the two Si
 <sup>p</sup> atoms on the opposite triangles. The formation of intericosahedral Si
 <sup>p</sup>–Si
 <sup>p</sup> exo-bonds, on the other hand, is highly unfavorable (by more than 1.294 eV/bond). The stability of intraicosahedral skeleton Si
 <sup>p</sup>–Si
 <sup>p</sup> bonds is in stark contrast to the situation in the recently proposed high-pressure phase of boron carbide B
 <sub>2.5</sub>C. In B
 <sub>2.5</sub>C, the energy cost to form skeleton C
 <sup>p</sup>–C
 <sup>p</sup> bonds is about 0.4 eV/bond.

 </sup> The lowest-energy σ of α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> is considerably less stable than β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, by ∼30 meV/atom at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 0 K, and it is also unstable with respect to α-SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> and α-B
 <sub>12</sub>. The lowest-energy σ of the most boron-rich composition considered, α-SiB
 <sub>3.67</sub>, is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elemental phases at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 0 K.
