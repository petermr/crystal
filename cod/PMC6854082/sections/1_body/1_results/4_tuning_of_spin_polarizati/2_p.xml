<p id="Par17">The BSVSP effect might lead to some spintronic applications. By applying strain (e.g., via a piezoelectric material) or electric field to the system displaying the BSVSP effect, the spin polarization can be adjusted, thus the spin transport behavior can be tuned, which might lead to spintronic devices (such as spin-FET
