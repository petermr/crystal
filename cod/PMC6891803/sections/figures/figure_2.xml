  <p>(a) Schematic of the KMCS model, representing the deposition and diffusion of both phases, LMO (purple) and LLTO (green), on a STO (orange) surface. The bright areas indicate possible hopping positions for LMO adatoms on the surface. Note that adatoms that could lead to floating adatoms (indicated by the white arrow) have no possible hopping direction. (b) RHEED intensity oscillations during PLD growth of individual LLTO and LMO thin films on STO substrates. (c) Exponential fitting of the specular spot RHEED intensity variation during a single laser pulse for LLTO growth on the LLTO surface at different temperatures. (d) Arrhenius plot of the RHEED relaxation time dependence on the growth temperatures for several combinations: LLTO on STO, LLTO on LLTO, and LMO on STO. (e,f) KMC simulation showing the wetting and nonwetting behavior of LLTO and LMO thin films on a STO surface based on 12 deposition pulses using the activation energies for hopping as obtained by RHEED analysis.</p>
