<p>As listed in fig. S9D, hydrated species are all thermodynamically more stable than unhydrated species. This is similar to the fact that metal oxides such as silica generally have a number of hydroxyl terminals on their surfaces. On the other hand, quantitative discussion on the amount of hydration is difficult, because it is indispensable for this discussion to take into consideration the condensed phase of water surrounding Sn oxide SNCs as well as a number of isomeric structures of SNCs and conformational patterns of hydration. In the present study, the amount of hydration was practically determined such that the simulated Raman spectra reproduce the experimental ones. The most important point is that the consideration of hydration improves the simulated Raman spectra, thereby reproducing the experimental ones very well.</p>
