<p>TEM and HRTEM images of 5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were measured to study their morphology and microstructure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f007">Figure 7</xref>a–c). From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b, it can be seen that the 5% Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles remain the same spherical particles as the prepared pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, with a particle size of 11.3 ± 1.9 nm. The lattice stripes of 5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f007">Figure 7</xref>c, and the lattice stripe spacing of 0.352 to 0.360 nm corresponds to the (101) crystal plane of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> anatase phase. EDX mapping characterization was carried out to determine the doping status of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> in TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f007">Figure 7</xref>d, it can be seen that Fe, Ti and O elements are uniformly distributed in the whole visual field, indicating that Fe has formed uniform doping in TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and also proving that the uniform doping of Fe elements could be realized in IS-RPB.
