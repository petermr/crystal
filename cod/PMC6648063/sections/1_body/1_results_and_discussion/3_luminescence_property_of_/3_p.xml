 </xref>d shows the persistent luminescence decay curves of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.05Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>. BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> possesses quite low initial persistent luminescence intensity and will soon decay to the lower level. The co-doped BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> sample possesses a higher initial persistent luminescence intensity. After decaying to a certain intensity level, the decay of persistent luminescence becomes quite slow. Thus, it can emit persistent luminescence for a long time. To study the decay regularity of persistent luminescence, we fit the decay curves of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.05Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> and find that the decay of persistent luminescence in accordance with the second-order kinetic attenuation rule

 <sup>2+</sup>, α

 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, α
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.0413 and α
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.0042. It can thus be seen that the numerical value of α
 <sub>1</sub> and α
 <sub>2</sub> to the co-doped sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.05Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> is smaller than BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, which indicates that the Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion not only improves the persistent luminescence intensity of BASO: Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> but also decreases the persistent luminescence decay rate.
