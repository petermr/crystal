<p id="Par2">At present, LEDs which can convert power into light via the electrons and holes recombination radiating visible light have been integrated into every aspect of our lives and works. For instance, colorful LEDs are applied to backlight panel for displays and projectors, or as a kind of interior decorative material; white emission LEDs (w-LEDs) are widely used in indoor and outdoor illumination for replacing traditional incandescent due to their excellent characteristics: high luminescent efficiency, brightness, lower power consumption, long operation time, lower manufacture costs, high chemical stability and eco-friendly features etc

 </sup>. So far, there have been two kinds of method to get white light emission. One is that combination GaN/InGaN blue ships with YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> yellow emission phosphors, in which white light is composed of blue light and yellow light with cold color temperature owing to lack of red emission

 </sup>. The other one is based on UV/n-UV chips triple color (red, green and blue) compounds white emission, of which color rendering index is better than the former, but trade-off luminescent efficiency, different decay situations, complex assembly processes and costs expensive are primary reasons for restricting its development
