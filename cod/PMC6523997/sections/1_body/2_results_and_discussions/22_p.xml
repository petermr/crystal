<p>The stable, doped perovskite containing Zn(II) and 3-CPACl can alternatively be fabricated by a solid–solid reaction. The solid–solid reaction by grinding also works for other perovskite materials

This indicates that the perovskite α-phase is thermodynamically favorable for this composition, also in agreement with the phase stability that we observe for the final perovskite. By using a simple KBr press, the material can be turned into a perovskite pellet (see
