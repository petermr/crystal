 <caption> Pair-distribution functions of silica and silicate phases. Solid curves represent pair-distribution functions calculated for silica polymorphs (this work and ref. 25 ) and silicates 22, 23, 39 , compared with those for basalt 12 and silica 11 glass measured at different pressures: a, in the range from 28 to 38 GPa; b, in the range from 55 to 60 GPa </caption>
