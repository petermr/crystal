 </sup> Spin textures in skyrmions are topologically stable and can therefore also lead to interesting physical properties, such as the topological Hall effect and the generation of spin transfer torque.

 </sup> The vast body of work in this field has established essential ingredients for the stability of skyrmions.

 </sup> However, to come out with a recipe in the form of a compound, which contains all these essential ingredients, is a difficult task. The most important criterion to stabilize a skyrmion in a magnet is that its crystal structure should lack inversion symmetry. The induced Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) produced in this type of non-centrosymmetric compound ensures that the spins are aligned in a noncollinear fashion.

 </sup> Secondly, the stability of skyrmions at technologically relevant temperatures requires a large exchange interaction. The magnetic to nonmagnetic transition temperature (

 <sub>C</sub>) in large exchange interaction systems is usually high. Another favorable parameter for the stabilization of skyrmions over a broad range of temperature and magnetic field strength is the availability of easy axis, which can be attained in tetragonal or hexagonal crystal systems with large spin–orbit coupling.
