<p>In this work, we argue that an important requirement of our database is that the source of the initial structures as well as all the modifications that these structures underwent during the data cleaning process need to be fully tracked. Modifications are necessary to ensure a uniform formatting of the structures and to remove errors in the structure that were detected after a visual inspection or a suspect failure in the DFT optimization.</p>
