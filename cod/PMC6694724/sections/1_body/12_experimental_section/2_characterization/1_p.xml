 </sup> Laue diffraction patterns were simulated with the OrientExpress software. The compositions of the compound were characterized by scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and chemical analysis. The composition obtained from the EDAX analysis is 41% Mn, 30% Pt, and 29% Sn, and the composition obtained from chemical analysis is Mn
 <sub>1.43</sub>PtSn
 <sub>1.01</sub>, which are very close to the compositions obtained from single-crystal X-ray analysis (Mn
 <sub>41.86</sub>Pt
 <sub>29.07</sub>Sn
 <sub>29.07</sub> ≈ Mn
 <sub>1.44</sub>PtSn). DSC of the sample (∼56 mg) was performed using the NETZSCH DSC 404C instrument. Magnetic properties were measured in SQUID VSM (Quantum Design). The magnetic measurements were performed in the temperature range of 2–400 K and the magnetic field range of (−)7 to (+)7 T. The electrical resistivity was measured from 2 to 400 K in a Physical Property Measurement System.
