<p>Harmonic vibrational frequencies and intensities were obtained at the Gamma point in each case. The frequencies are numerically obtained in Crystal 09; to ensure the high stability of this procedure, numerical derivation (in the calculation of the second derivatives of the potential energy) was based on two-point finite difference scheme. The convergence criterion for the vibrational analysis was successfully achieved, as the sonic modes of the crystal lattice approached near zero values (not exceeding −0.5 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The calculated band positions were overestimated; the overestimation was decreasing towards lower wavenumbers. Few factors contribute to this; the key ones are likely overestimation of bond strengths, imperfect molecular structure, and neglecting of anharmonicity. To account for this fact, the calculated wavenumbers were scaled while using linear scaling (Equation (1)).
