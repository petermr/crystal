<p>It is known that the luminescent ions will reach the ground state via thermal quenching. They can go to the ground state when the excited state and the ground state energy curves cross at an energy that is thermally accessible from the relaxed excited state. The nonradiative rate, k
 <sub>nr</sub>, can be expressed as

 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>A</italic> is a constant, 
 <italic>k</italic> is Boltzmann’s constant (≈8.62 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>), and 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> is the activation energy for the thermal quenching process. The probability of nonradiative transition increasing with temperature leads to a decrease of emission intensity. Thermal quenching of the emission intensity of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> mainly accounts for the jumping of excited electrons into the charge-transfer state band with absorbing thermal energy, as schematically shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>a, a condition in which the probability of nonradiative transition increases. Then, the emission intensity of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>-activated phosphor decreases. It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>b that the luminescence intensity of the GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors exhibited a slight increase as the temperature increases in the range of room temperature to 340 K and then remained steady in the range of 340–450 K, followed by a decrease over 450 K. This phenomenon was attributed to the following reason. The rise of temperature accelerates the molecular thermal motion to a certain extent to promote the photon radiation transition. However, when the temperature reaches a certain value, the nonradiative transition dominates, resulting in a decrease in the luminous intensity. 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is used as a numerator in the formula because the fluorescence intensity is the strongest at ambient temperature by default. To ensure that

 <italic>/I –</italic> 1 is a positive number, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was defined as the intensity of emission at 348 K. As expressed by

 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor. By comparing with the phosphors reported,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>−
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
 </sup> it can be seen that the phosphor synthesized by our method excels in both quantum efficiency and thermal stability (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>), which was attributed to the following two reasons: First, the annealing treatment (1200 °C) is used in the preparation process, which makes the particle structure more tolerant to high temperatures. Second, since the radius of the B atom is smaller, the interaction force between the B atom and O atom is stronger and the bonding is more stable than that of other host materials, which leads to good thermal stability. Energy transfer among the dopants is the main reason for concentration quenching, which also greatly affects the quantum yield. The critical distance is roughly estimated by the following formula

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> is the critical distance, 
 <italic>V</italic> is the volume of the unite cell, 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> refers to the critical concentration, and 
 <italic>N</italic> refers to the number of formula units per unit cell. For this system, the short distance between Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions will lead to energy transfer between ions, increase the probability of nonradiative transitions, and weaken the fluorescence performance, similar to concentration quenching. When the distance between Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions and Gd
 <sup>3+</sup> ions is too long, the energy transfer between two ions is hindered and the energy utilization rate is reduced. The high-gravity RPB reactor can provide a homogeneous environment for the growth of particles, effectively control the distance between rare-earth ions, successfully avoid the above disadvantages, and therefore improve the quantum yield.
