<p>Although the lead-free perovskite materials have already found their implementation as an efficient photosensitive media for photodetectors and solar cells [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], these materials are still far from their commercial implementation due to their stability. This drawback becomes crucial when lead-free perovskites are applied as an emissive media in lasing systems and lighting applications. Since almost all chemical properties of lead-free perovskites are similar to that of Pb-based, the methods of stability increasing used for Pb-based can be adopted and implemented for lead-free perovskites. Several methods can be highlighted for this purpose: In-situ synthesis in polar environment [
 <xref rid="B58-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], in-situ synthesis in protective matrices [
 <xref rid="B59-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the surface passivation by chemical post-treatment [
 <xref rid="B61-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and the embedding into the protective matrices [
 <xref rid="B63-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The implementing of the host matrices is most appropriate for the further use in photonics application since this approach allows the in-situ design of the morphology of the active media, including size and shape, which is crucial for the performance of the emitting resonant devices, such as lasers.
