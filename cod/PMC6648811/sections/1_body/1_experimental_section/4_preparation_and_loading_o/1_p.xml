 </sup> were used. The round PDs (10 mm diameter, 2 mm thick) were fabricated by mixing the monomer base (Part A) and the curing agent (Part B) in the weight ratios recommended by data sheets from the manufacturer NuSil Technology for the different formulations and then deaerated under vacuum in the antechamber of an inert atmosphere box for 25 min. An aliquot of this mixture (∼200 μL) was added to a custom-made mold (10 mm diameter, 2 mm height). Next, the PD was annealed at ∼110 °C for ∼1 h and then allowed to set at room temperature for at least 12 h. After fabrication, the PDs were removed from the mold and transferred into the glovebox for infusion of the photoNORM. This was done by incubating the PD in a concentrated tetrahydrofuran solution (0.4 mL) of

 <sub>4</sub> (3.1 mg/mL) for 5 h followed by vacuum drying. This was repeated 3 times. Finally, the dried PDs were washed with THF and methanol and multiple times with water to remove surface photoNORM that was not impregnated into the PD. This was repeated until no PetACrONO was detected in the wash solution. After several such washes, no leaching was evident in the solution spectra even after 24 h incubation in aqueous media. The resulting PDs were stored in the dark under an inert atmosphere until use. For PDs prepared for NIR studies, a 5 mg portion of the solid Nd-UCNPs was physically mixed with the polymer in the disk molds before curing.
