<p>For initial nanoparticles, the Mössbauer spectrum is a line of noise measurements with low-intensity peaks characteristic of an unformed magnetic phase. For specimens annealed at a temperature of 400 °C, an asymmetric doublet is observed, which is characteristic of the paramagnetic state of iron oxide FeO in the amorphous phase. Also, the strong broadening and asymmetry of lines indicates a strong disordering and the presence in the structure of a high content of cationic vacancies, which reaffirms the X-ray phase analysis data. Increasing the annealing temperature to 600 °C, a narrowing of the doublet lines and the emergence of sextet lines characteristic of the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> phase is observed. The magnitude of the hyperfine magnetic field for a sextet is 503.7 kOe, which is consistent with a field characteristic of the hematite phase in a highly disordered state. At an annealing temperature of 800 °C, the Mössbauer spectrum is a sextet characteristic of hematite (the magnitude of the hyperfine magnetic field is 512.5 kOe) and a low-intensity paramagnetic doublet characteristic of amorphous inclusions [

The deviation of the magnitude of the hyperfine magnetic field for the nanoparticles under study from the reference value is due to the presence of impurity phase inclusions in the structure, as well as regions of structure disorder caused by the presence of different phases. According to the data obtained, a growth in the annealing temperature result in a drop in the contribution of the partial spectrum characteristic of the paramagnetic state, which demonstrates a drop in the concentration of cationic vacancies in the crystal structure and its ordering. Also, the formation of a sextet characteristic of the hematite phase indicates the appearance of a magnetic texture in the structure of nanoparticles with its further ordering [
