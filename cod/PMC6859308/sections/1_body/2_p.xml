<p>Among proposed hypotheses, the quinoline-family drugs are believed to damage the parasite by the following steps: 1) via quinoline capping the growing hemozoin crystals, thereby retarding deposition of heme onto the crystal surface (

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/>
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), although this process should be secondary in terms of inhibiting crystal growth (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The net result in both hypotheses is damage imparted to the parasite by heme released from hemoglobin but unable to crystallize (
