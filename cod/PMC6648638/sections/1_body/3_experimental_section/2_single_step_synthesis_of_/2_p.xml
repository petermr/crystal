<p>To synthesize red QDs,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
 </sup> 1 mmol of cadmium oxide, 4 mmol of zinc acetate, and 5 mL of oleic acid were placed in a 250 mL three-necked flask. The mixture was heated to 150 °C, degassed 0.1 Torr pressure to remove water for 30 min, purged with N
 <sub>2</sub> gas, and heated to 300 °C and 15 mL of 1-octadecene (ODE) was injected into the reacted mixture forming a clear solution of Cd(OA)
 <sub>2</sub> and Zn(OA)
 <sub>2</sub>. At 300 °C, 0.4 mL of 1 M selenium-dissolved trioctylphosphine solution was added to the above mixture, 4 mmol of sulfur powder was dissolved in 4 mL of trioctylphosphine and were injected into the reactor in 30 s. The reaction was set at 300 °C for 10 min to promote the growth of CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs, and the reactor was cooled to room temperature to stop the reaction. These QDs were further purified by the addition of toluene (20 mL) and excess ethanol three times; they were finally redispersed in toluene.
