    <td>The experimental structural XRD data were obtained using a CuKα radiation source.
     <break/>The calculated data were obtained using a plane wave cut-off of at least 400.00 eV and k-spacings of 0.230 × 0.230 × 0.230 Å

    <td>Description of data collection</td>
    <td>The XRD data were obtained with a Bragg Brentano configuration for polycrystalline samples with a wavelength of λ = 0.1542 nm.
     <break/>The calculated data were obtained by building the crystal structure of the phase and optimizing it using VASP and allowing structure, volume, and atomic sites to relax and then, in a subsequent run, using MT or phonon to obtain the Thermodynamic properties vs temperature.
