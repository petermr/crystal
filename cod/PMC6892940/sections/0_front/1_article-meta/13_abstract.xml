  <sub>6</sub> (

  <sub>6</sub>, Ni and Re sublattices are found to exhibit curious magnetic states separately, but no long range magnetic ordering is achieved. The magnetic transition at ~255 K is identified with the independent Re sublattice magnetic ordering. Interestingly, the sublattice interactions are tuned by modifying the Ni-O-Re bond angles through Ca doping. Upon Ca doping, the Ni and Re sublattices start to display a ferrimagnetically ordered state at low temperature. The neutron powder diffraction data reveals long range ferrimagnetic ordering of the Ni and Re magnetic sublattices along the crystallographic 
  <italic>b-</italic>axis. The transition temperature of the ferrimagnetic phase increases monotonically with increasing Ca concentration.
