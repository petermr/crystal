<p>The plot of the relative quantum yield is shown in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> (blue line), along with the energy evolution of PL (green and red traces) as function of pressure. The (relative) quantum yield is nearly unchanged before 3.5 GPa, but markedly drops after, following the behavior of the intensity and PL lifetimes. The optical performance of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> with pressure is distinctly divided into highly radiative (0 to 3.5 GPa) and nonradiative (&gt;3.5 GPa) regions. Comparing to the energy evolution of PL, we can see that the reversible and the highly radiative regions overlap. In this reversible and radiative region, η(η
 <sub>r</sub>) is nearly constant but 〈τ〉 decreases, which indicates that the radiative recombination rate is enhanced by pressures below 3.5 GPa. That is, the material emits light even more efficiently than at 0 pressure. As a result, (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> has both wide tunability of bandgap and constant quantum yield at modest pressure range, which might be a strong implication for the use of 2D organolead halide perovskites in optoelectronics modulated by pressure.
