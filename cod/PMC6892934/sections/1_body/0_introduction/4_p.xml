<p id="Par5">Nano-indentation has been widely used to gain mechanistic insight into the shallow helium-damaged layers. Nano-indentation of 0.3 at.% helium-implanted samples (implanted at 298 K) showed a 30% increase in hardness

 </sup>. Corresponding observations of 50% lower thermal diffusivity (at room temperature)

 </sup> were also made. Helium-induced changes were also distinctly visible in the indent morphology. Large pile-up and slip steps were noticed around indents in the helium-implanted tungsten sample as compared to shallow pile-up around indents in pure tungsten. This was seen for both Berkovich indents (250 nm deep

 </sup>) and spherical indents (~500 nm deep

 </sup>). Moreover, 3D resolved micro-beam Laue diffraction measurement of residual lattice distortions beneath the indents showed a significantly smaller deformation zone in the implanted material
