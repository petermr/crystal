<p>Recently, more effort has been put into understanding the structural phase transition mechanism of GeSe under high pressure [

 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In one of the earliest studies, Bhatia et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] claimed that they observed a phase transition of GeSe from a non-metallic orthorhombic structure to a metallic rock salt structure at 6 GPa. Hsueh et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that they could not locate the structural phase transition up to 13 GPa, but the predicted electronic structure transformation from a non-metallic into metallic state was about 6 GPa. In addition, Onodera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-03612" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also argued that GeSe could retain orthorhombic symmetry up to 82 GPa, but it showed metallic behavior above 25 GPa. Recently, Xu et al. used XRD to study the structural transition of GeSe at high pressure. They observed a continuous phase transition from orthorhombic (
 <italic>Pnma</italic>) to orthorhombic (
 <italic>Cmcm</italic>) occurring in a wide pressure range (25â€“35 GPa), and the structural phase transition completed near 40 GPa [
