<p id="Par3">For two decades the electronic structure of plutonium has been explained by essentially two contrasting behaviors of the 5f electrons. On one hand, the 5f electrons are interpreted as substantially delocalized (band electrons) and within this model the counterintuitive and astounding ground-state α phase is understood

 </sup>. On the other hand, the 5f electrons are postulated to be largely localized (atomic like) and this picture is used
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup> to explain the high-temperature δ phase of plutonium. For the last twenty years, many papers have been published focusing on either of these two opposing views for plutonium’s electronic structure, see for example ref.
