<p>The present study has some limitations. First, we could not directly compare the histological findings for the femur and 7-T MR images acquired in the present condition using human fetal specimens because we are not allowed to destroy the human fetal specimens. Instead, the correlation with histological and MRI findings could be evaluated using embryonic rat samples. Second, our samples were stored in a medium containing formaldehyde for a long period. We speculate that the differentiation and maturation of the diaphysis may affect the change in signal intensity in that region. However, it cannot be excluded that conditions such as long-term fixation in each sample may alter the differences in signal intensity. The possibility that morphology and several morphometric data were affected as a result of fixation or the process of termination cannot be excluded. Third, our samples, which were obtained by artificial abortion, were recognized as externally normal; nonetheless, it is not guaranteed that all samples show normal and standard development. Fourth, we employed several kinds of image acquisition methods based on specimen resolution and volume. The data provided by images acquired using PCX-CT and MRI are not identical, although the approximate morphology is comparable. Finally, the synchronized development of the surrounding muscles and joint formations was not analyzed together with femur formation, because the image resolution in the present study was not so high to precisely detect the attachments of the muscle tendons and joint ligaments.</p>
