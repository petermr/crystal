<p>(i) Calibration of the photographic camera: Knowledge of the intrinsic parameters of the camera that define the conical projection of the obtained image is crucial to define the geometry of the image. These parameters are the focal distance, position of the main point, radial and tangential distortion, perpendicularity between axes, and pixel size and number of horizontal and vertical pixels. The calibration of the camera can be carried out in a previous process in which photographs are taken to already calibrated standards or, on the other hand, if a previous calibration is not carried out, the EXIF metadata file associated with the file of the digital image obtained can be used [
