<p>We have identified 2 sources of Br atoms in the examined samples. One is the BrQ drug introduced at the ∼100 nM level. The second source is background Br originating from bovine serum used for culturing the malaria parasites, reportedly present in the form of 2-octyl γ-bromoacetoacetate (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Measured concentrations of the background Br range up to 4 μM. As shown below, we have been able to effectively separate the total Br signal arising from BrQ and the serum and establish unambiguously that only BrQ decorates hemozoin crystals and the digestive vacuole membrane.
