  <title>Phase structure and physical properties of Co

  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Single-crystal XRD pattern of Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub>. The pattern was recorded by rocking by 32° about the 
   <italic>b</italic> axis of the rhombohedral cell. The high quality of the crystal is proven by the clear and sharp diffraction spots. The faint rings may be attributed to distortions and contaminations on the crystal surface. A typical SEM image of the single crystal is shown in the upper left corner. (
   <bold>B</bold>) HRTEM image of the Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub> single crystal prepared using the FIB technique and the SAED pattern recorded along the [001] crystal orientation. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Temperature dependence of electric resistivity of Co
   <sub>3</sub>Sn
   <sub>2</sub>S
   <sub>2</sub> single crystal in zero field. The current was applied along the 
   <italic>a</italic> and 
   <italic>c</italic> axes. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Reciprocal susceptibility as a function of temperature. The magnetic moments are derived from Co atoms in the Kagome lattice. Using Curie Weiss law, an effective Bohr magneton μ
   <sub>eff</sub> of 0.31 μ
   <sub>B</sub>/Co is obtained.
