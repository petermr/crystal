 <caption> Pattern photoalignment of the light‐emitting CdSe/CdS QRs. a) Substrate containing six grating patterns with differing pitch/domain sizes in ambient light. b) Optical microscope images of the same substrate, presenting two neighboring grating patterns separated by a dashed line with domain sizes of 50 (left) and 40 µm (right). c) Diffraction image of a green laser (543.5 nm) after passing through the diffraction grating, showing zero, first and second order diffraction. d) Schematics, highlighting the origin of dark ( I min) and bright ( I max) states, according to the orientation of the QRs in regard to the polarizer main axis. e) Micrographs of fluorescent grating patterns with domain sizes of 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, and 2 µm. f) Representative intensity profile, recorded from the 30 µm pattern, following Malus' law. g) Normalized polarization ratios (from 2.5 to 1), determined from the intensity profiles (panel (f)) of each grating pattern, shown in (e). Format is chosen to illustrate the relative drops in the polarization ratios. The films were excited with a 12 V/100 W halogen lamp through a 546/12 nm bandpass filter. h) A simple illustration of the 2D binary alignment of the QR and emission profile against the polarization azimuth of the irradiating light.
