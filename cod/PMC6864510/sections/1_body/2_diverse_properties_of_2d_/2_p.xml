<p>The 2D RPPs are made of a series of alternately arranged inorganic and organic layers. They have a quantum well structure: the inorganic layer “well” is composed of metal halide, and the organic cation insulating layer acts as “barrier” to isolate the inorganic layer. The inorganic layers have large quantum confinement effect due to the small dielectric shielding effect from the organic cations, which confines the charge in the inorganic layer and is more conducive to charge recombination. Further, the number of stacked inorganic layers reflects the intensity of the quantum confinement effect. Single layer shows the strongest quantum confinement effect.</p>
