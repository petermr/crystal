<p id="Par4">Helium-implantation defects induced at room temperature are challenging to probe. For example, high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) micrographs of 0.3 at.% helium-implanted tungsten samples (exposed at room temperature) showed no visible damage

 </sup>. This implies that the induced defects are smaller than 1.5 nm, the sensitivity limit of TEM to lattice defects
