 </sup>. However, in the highly deformed volume directly beneath the indent, where steep strain gradients exist, Laue peaks become streaked

 </sup>. This streaking is linked to the underlying GND population within the probed volume, as described e.g. by Barabash

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. Unfortunately streaked Laue peaks cannot be fitted as accurately, leading to a loss of strain and lattice rotation resolution in this region. For example, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, CPFE predicts rapid variations of lattice rotation immediately below the indent that are not resolved by Laue diffraction. The high spatial resolution of HR-EBSD

 </sup> complements the Laue measurements by giving detailed information in this region.
