<p>It is more common in the inorganic perovskites for applied pressure to induce distortions that preserve the cubic topology, often in a similar sequence to that induced by temperature. In these cases, as predicted by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor formalism, a similar relationship may hold between transitions induced by pressure and by cation size. For instance, BaTiO
 <sub>3</sub> (

 <sub>Ti</sub> = 0.605 Å) has a tetragonal structure, with 
 <bold>B</bold>-site Ti cations displaced from the centre of their octahedra, at ambient temperature and pressure; this transforms under pressure to the cubic perovskite aristotype. Increasing the size of the 
 <bold>B</bold>-site cation, BaSnO
 <sub>3</sub> (

 <sub>Sn</sub> = 0.69 Å) has the cubic structure under ambient conditions [
