  <p>Stability studies of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
   <sub>2</sub>. 
   <bold>a</bold> PXRD patterns of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
   <sub>2</sub> before and after 1000 cycles. Patterns were measured directly on the surface of the glassy carbon working electrode on which the catalyst ink was deposited. A small amount of silicon powder was placed on the surface to act as an internal standard. PXRD patterns obtained after electrocatalytic measurements were performed directly on the electrode surface; therefore a layer of H
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub> electrolyte is present and may result in weaker Bragg reflections. 
   <bold>b</bold> Wide-range Raman spectra of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
   <sub>2</sub> measured before (top) and after 1000 cycles (bottom). Raman spectra obtained after electrochemical measurements were performed directly on the electrode surface, therefore a layer of H
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub> electrolyte is present thus resulting in an increased background after 1000 cycles. Particle morphologies of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
