 </xref>D. Compared with the pristine phase, neither peak shifts nor formation of extra phases are observed, this pointing to insignificant (if any) Mg de-insertion from MgTa
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub>, even under the severe oxidizing conditions employed and the electrochemical capacity observed being related to side reactions most likely involving electrolyte decomposition. Attempts to insert additional Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in the MgTa
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub> structure were carried out by electrochemical reduction in Mg cells at 100 Â°C, using a 0.3 M Mg(TFSI)
 <sub>2</sub>, EC/PC 1:1 electrolyte, which resulted in very low capacities and no changes in the X-ray powder diffraction patterns.
