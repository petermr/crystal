<p id="Par16">LCO and super P Li, as an electro-conductive additive, and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone were mixed by sonication. The slurry was dropped and dried on the Au mesh with a carbon micro-grid, which was connected to an Al current collector. The electrode was used as a working electrode of the 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>. A key point for construction of the 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell is fabrication of a flat working electrode to create low interfacial resistivity for lithium ion transport and to produce an Au mesh with carbon microgrid without mechanical damage. For not only electrochemical but also mechanical reasons, to construct the 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell, we needed a hard and flat solid-state electrolyte. Thus, we used the Li
 <sub>7</sub>La
 <sub>3</sub>Zr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> (LLZ) plate electrolyte. The interfacial resistivity between LCO and LLZ is high due to the point contact. Therefore, dry polymer electrolytes are used to decrease the interfacial resistivity.
