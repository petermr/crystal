<p>The polarized emission for the QR films depends on two factors: (i) the quality of the QRs, which is primarily defined by the florescent anisotropy, discussed above, and (ii) the quality of the unidirectional alignment of QRs, which is reflected by the order parameter. Additionally, because excitons in the QRs oscillate in mutually perpendicular directions, the QR alignment should not have any tilt for the alignment to leverage the full benefits of the polarized emission form QRs. Semiconductor QRs are characterized by the anisotropic absorption and emission, and therefore, by manipulating the angle of the polarization azimuth of the exciting beam in respect of the
