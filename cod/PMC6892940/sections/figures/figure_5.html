 <caption> Magnetic measurements: ( a– c) ZFC FC, M ( T ) data of LaSr 1− x Ca x NiReO 6 with x = 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 measured with H = 200 Oe. Inset of ( a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of x = 0.0 composition in an applied field of 5000 Oe. ( d) M ( H ) curves for x = 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 compositions. Inset shows variation of H C with doping. </caption>
