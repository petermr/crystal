<p id="Par21">ML-LSA was applied to the local structure analyses of large and complex quenched LCP trajectories. The quenched trajectories exhibited complex local structures containing nematic- and smectic-like mesogenic structures. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, conventional particle-based local structure analyzing methods could not distinguish between these structures. However, we successfully classified these complex local structures using ML-LSA, regardless of the user-dependent parameter, i.e., the aspect ratio of mesogenic ellipsoids. Furthermore, the results of ML-LSA suggest that the best order parameter is
