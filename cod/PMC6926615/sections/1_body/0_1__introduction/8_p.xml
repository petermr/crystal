<p>In a recent review [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] by F. Sani et al., information on lead-free organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells was summarized. The authors inferred that the structural modification affects greatly the overall photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. Jia Sun et al. in their recent perspective [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] discussed different types of lead-free perovskite materials for future optoelectronic applications as LEDs and inferred that the working routes on the lead-based perovskites would benefit not only the developing field of light-emitting devices, but also the field of perovskite-based photovoltaics. Jiajun Luo et al. in their review [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] noted that although several types of lead-free perovskite materials were already established, there is still plenty of work to be done, including evolving the synthesis routes to achieve controllable PL peak position and PL QYs above 80%, improving the outdoor stability of operating devices, and expanding their applications towards luminescent solar concentrators and X-ray scintillators. In the lead-free perovskite family, 2D materials are highlighted by Jie Wang et al. in their recent review [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with a focus on their perspective properties as highly luminescent phosphor for novel lightning applications.
