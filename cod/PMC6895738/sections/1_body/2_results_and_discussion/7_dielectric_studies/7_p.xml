<p id="p0195">The ability of NCN0.25 to more actively capture water by a layered structure is confirmed by the low activation energy (
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>). The nature of the dependences is determined by the contribution of the electronic conductivity due to the presence of the intrinsic defects (oxygen, sodium vacancies, and the adsorption products — desorption of trapped water).
