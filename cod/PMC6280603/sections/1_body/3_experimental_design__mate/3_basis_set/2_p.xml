<p id="p0050">Multielectron wave functions are constructed as an antisymmetrized product (Slater determinant) of monoelectronic crystalline orbitals (CO) that are linear combination of local functions (atomic orbitals, AO) centred on each atom in the system. In turn, atomic orbitals (basis set) are linear combinations of Gaussian-type functions (GTF). The all-electron basis sets employed in the present simulations for Ca
