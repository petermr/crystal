<p>Light-emitting coatings based on rare-earth (RE)-doped phosphors are the key ingredients in recent light-emitting devices.

 </sup> Their robustness lies in the high chemical and thermal stability of their optical performance, which makes them almost insensitive to temperature or environmental changes. The canonical configuration found in most luminaries of this kind consists of an electroluminescent blue-light-emitting diode (LED) used to photoexcite a thick coating of cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Ce-YAG) crystals, which emits a broad band in the green-to-red region of the visible spectrum.

 </sup> The combination of such photoluminescence (PL) with a part of the incoming blue light that passes through the color converter without being absorbed results in the white light we are accustomed to.
