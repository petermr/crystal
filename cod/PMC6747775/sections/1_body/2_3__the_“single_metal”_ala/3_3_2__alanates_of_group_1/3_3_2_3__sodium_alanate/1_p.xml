<p>NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> is the most important and studied alanate. NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> is used as a reducing agent in many reactions unrelated to the hydrogen storage. Due to the work of Bogdanović et al. on the use of catalysts or additives, the regeneration of NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> is possible in the solid-state. Thus, this material has been seriously considered for hydrogen storage [
