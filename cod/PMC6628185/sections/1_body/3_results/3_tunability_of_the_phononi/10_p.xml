<p>In conclusion, we have reported on the phononic properties of GaP nanowires twinning superlattices by investigating them with inelastic light scattering. We have observed the E

 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> mode characteristic of the WZ crystal structure and a number of spectral features beyond the TO mode. The first of these observations was unexpected, because the nanowires investigated locally possessed a ZB structure. However, the twin defect stacking confers an overall hexagonal structure to the system giving rise to this phonon mode. The second observation was a direct result of the folding of the dispersion relation determined by the periodic superstructure. Both of these observations were unambiguously corroborated by ab initio theoretical calculations and by the dependence of these spectral fingerprints on the spacing of the twin planes. This fact supports the tunability of the phonon spectrum of these systems and paves the way toward the achievement of phononic properties by design.

 </sup> We suggest that future heat transport experiments will show that this controlled tuning of the phonon spectrum also results in a measurable modification of the thermal conductivity, because (i) our calculations demonstrate that also acoustic modes undergo the same folding as optical modes (see
