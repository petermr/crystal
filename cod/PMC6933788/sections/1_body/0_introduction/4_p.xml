<p>In our article, the single crystal of Rb
 <sub>3</sub>Na(H
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>·3H
 <sub>2</sub>O was obtained by a mild-temperature hydrothermal method in a short synthesis period. We reported the crystal structure and measured the powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), IR spectrum, UV–vis–NIR spectrum, thermal analysis, SHG properties, and ab initio theoretical calculations of the title compound.
