<p>To test the feasibility of signal calibration method and resolution of the multi-channel THz radar system, an InISAR imaging experiment on two corner reflectors was carried out. The experimental scene are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f004">Figure 4</xref>. In the experiment, the distance from antenna plane and turntable center is 4.1 m, the altitude difference of the two corner reflectors is about 7.2 cm, the pulse width is 160 μs, the pulse repetition frequency is 2500 Hz, the sample frequency is 12.5 MHz, the rotational rate of turntable is 90°/s, and the total rotation angle is 4°.
