<p>Gacoin's group has developed a simple coating method to make an aligned QR film using a thixotropic gel suspension, as illustrated in

 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e. A 20 µL drop of solution containing QRs was deposited onto a substrate and the substrate was dragged under the coating blade by a robotic arm with a constant speed and a fixed gap thickness from the blade plane. The gap thickness was varied from 20 to 100 µm to control the film thickness. The substrate, coated with the sheared suspension coming out of the blade, was heated to 140 °C on a hotplate to evaporate the ethylene glycols solvent. Later the solidified film was annealed in a furnace at 500 °C for 2 h. While dragging the blade over the suspension, a constant shear rate (d

 <sup>–1</sup>) was applied after generating a Couette flow in the gap and thus uniformly shearing the suspension. They confirmed that the required rate for the QR orientation in the rod gel is only ≈10 s
 <sup>–1</sup>, which is suitable for the typical coating techniques used for roll‐to‐roll processes. When the flow stopped, the attractive interparticle forces led the sol to turn back to a gel state in the absence of shear stress. This froze the rods into an oriented alignment, with only minor short‐range defects present. This approach was used to align QRs having relatively large size (length ≈200 nm) compared to CdSe‐based QRs normally used. However, high temperature processing makes it difficult to be used for LCD applications.
