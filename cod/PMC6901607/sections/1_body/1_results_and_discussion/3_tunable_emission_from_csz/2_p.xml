<p id="Par12">Furthermore, the remarkable fluorescence quality of halide perovskite NCs such as narrower line-width and wider color gamut coincide with the requirements for high-quality white light generation. However, metal halide perovskite NCs having different emissions cannot directly be mixed to produce white light as cadmium-based NCs, because of the rapid anion exchange process for this material. To overcome this issue, Pathak 
 <italic>et al</italic>. have reported the remote phosphor technique to obtain white light by stacking different color emitting NCs containing quartz substrates as the color conversion layers on top of the blue LEDs and obtained a CRI of 86 and a CCT of 5229 K

 </sup>. In this structure, the gap maintained between the LED chips and the conversion layers protect the NCs from the direct effect of heat produced by the LEDs. This non-contact configuration is a reliable approach to avoid the heating effect on the NCs without disturbing the LED junction principle. Thus, this work stimulates us to study further about the applications of this technique. We proposed the tetradic phosphor technique to get white light by employing the four different color emitting NCs in conjunction with UV LED and succeed to observe a high value of CRI (up to 95.4) and LER (&gt;300 lm·W
 <sup>−1</sup>) with tunable CCT from warm to cold hue

 </sup>. The enhancement in the quality and optical property of light is attributed to the incorporation of an additional yellow phosphor component that bridges the energy gap between the green and red phosphor components.
