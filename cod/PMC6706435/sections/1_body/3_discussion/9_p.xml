<p id="Par43">The total data considered, which were obtained by different methods, are in a good agreement. The relatively simple method of electrical conductivity with the high sensitivity and the modest statistics allows us to diagnose experimentally the decrease of the reaction zone duration for smaller grain size. The dependence Φ(
 <italic>ρ</italic>) is determined just by the grain size, and it shows high repeatability and minimum scatter due to the increase of homogeneity. The use of a fine-grained HE for making even high density charges by pressing leads to the shorter reaction zone and the higher homogeneity of the charge structure.
