<p>The products have then been characterized by EPR at low temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f012">Figure 12</xref>). As previously shown, the signal at 
 <italic>g</italic> = 2.0026, with a higher intensity for the argon annealed powder, than for the annealed powder at 10
 <sup>−4</sup> bar, corresponds to the free electrons created within the materials by the reducing atmosphere. As soon as the atmosphere becomes more oxidizing, the signal assigned to free electrons disappears, i.e., for the powders annealed at 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar and 10
 <sup>−2</sup> bar (
