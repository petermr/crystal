<p>The angle distribution of water molecules is the most intuitive physical quantity to describe the orientation of water molecules in the FHS. The distribution of cos(α) and cos(γ) near the interface is depicted in

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>. As expected, the water molecules uniformly distribute around ions in the solution and have no preferential orientation. However, as approaching to the interface, obviously the preferential orientation of water molecules in FHS appears. In other words, the FHS of ions tends to be ordered as approaching to the interface. When a Na
 <sup>+</sup> approaches to the crystal surface, there are obviously two preferred directions, around cos(γ) = 0 and 1, and α prefers to stay around cos(α)= 0 and ±1. For Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, the distribution of cos(γ) is similar to that for Na
 <sup>+</sup>. On the contrary, the distribution of cos(α) for Cl
 <sup>–</sup> seems to have five preferred values of 0.0, ±0.71, and ±1.0, as approaching to the crystal surface.
