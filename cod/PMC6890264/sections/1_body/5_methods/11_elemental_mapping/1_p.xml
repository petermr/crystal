<p>Elemental mapping was performed on a Talos F200X electron microscope equipped with a 200 kV XFEG. X-ray detection was done using four symmetrically placed SuperX-EDX detectors. Imaging was performed in high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy mode, with a current of 700 pA using a Fischione Instruments HAADF detector. Obtained data were analyzed using Bruker Esprit software.</p>
