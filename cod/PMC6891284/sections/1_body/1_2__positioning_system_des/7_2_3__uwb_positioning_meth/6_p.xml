<p>The accuracy of the UWB positioning system does not decrease with time, as it does not include accumulated errors. However, the system is affected by external interference. Hence, we use a fusion algorithm for the fusion of odometer data and location data with the UWB positioning system to ensure the accuracy of the coordinates in real time.</p>
