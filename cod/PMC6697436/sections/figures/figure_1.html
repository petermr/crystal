 <caption> Crystal and band structure of bulk single-crystal Co 3Sn 2S 2. ( A) Crystal structure of Co 3Sn 2S 2 obtained from single-crystal XRD and the Kagome lattice structure constructed by Co atoms in the a- b plane. ( B) The 3D BZ projected in the (001) direction. Three pairs of nodal lines are shown in the first BZ. ( C) Band structure of Co 3Sn 2S 2 in a paramagnetic state without the consideration of SOC effect. The band linear crossing near the Fermi energy can be found around the point L. ( D) Band structure of Co 3Sn 2S 2 with the inclusion of SOC effect. The band linear crossing is open, resulting in the band gap. ( E) The nontrivial surface states on (001) facet of Co 3Sn 2S 2 crystal with Sn termination, which is not fully occupied and located just above the Fermi level. ( F) The contribution of Co atoms to the nontrivial surface states shown in (E). Nearly all the states originate from the surface Co Kagome layer. </caption>
