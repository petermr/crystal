<p>However, it is now well established that the kinematical approach is not appropriate to determine the correctness of such a build structure (Palatinus, Petříček, &amp; Correa, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Roussel et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and that dynamical effects are still present in the data even with beam‐precession. The previous model was therefore used as the starting one for dynamical refinement. This still emerging approach has already been used successfully a few times and is now recognized as a good alternative for accurate structure determination and refinement of submicronic samples (Colmont et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Palatinus et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Rondeau et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). After several cycles of refinements of both atomic parameters (positions, and thermal ones) and orientation‐thickness of the sample, encouraging agreement factors were obtained, supporting the opportunity to go further with this dataset. At this point, several possibilities were tested, such as the possibility to have mixed occupancy of Mg and Fe on big sites and only iron on small ones. This hypothesis leads to better agreement factors and to a chemical formula closest to the EDS‐determined one. However, the atomic displacement parameter of the small site (fully occupied by iron in this case) is abnormally high, indicating that this site “possesses too many electrons”. A way to decrease the number of electrons assigned on this site is to replace, partly or entirely, the iron (
 <italic>Z</italic>=26) by silicon (
 <italic>Z</italic>=14). The two hypotheses were tested, and both lead to close agreement factors (wR around 0.075) and this time reasonable thermal parameters. The refined chemical formulae are Mg
 <sub>1.943</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.414</sub>Si
 <sub>0.809</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> for a site occupied by 85% of Si and 15% of Fe and Mg
 <sub>1.958</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.375</sub>Si
 <sub>0.833</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> for a site occupied only by silicon, both very close the EDS one (Mg
 <sub>1.99</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.21</sub>Si
 <sub>0.84</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>). In summary, whatever the chosen model, it is clear that this octahedral site is mostly occupied by silicon.
