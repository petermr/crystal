 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f008">Figure 8</xref>, we can see as follows: the fitted line of the Poole–Frenkel effect is in the low field strength range of the high field strength region; the degree of coincidence with the experimental data is higher; and the fitting line with the Schottky effect is lower. When the field strength rises above a certain threshold, the slope of the experimental data decreases, which reduces the fit of the fitted line with the Poole–Frenkel effect, and the coincidence with the fitted line of the Schottky effect is significantly improved. The fitting results show that during the field strength increase, the conductance mechanism of the high field strength non-ohmic region changes from the Poole–Frenkel effect to the electrode (Schottky) effect. In addition, in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, we can see that as the crystallinity of different density polyethylene increases, the threshold field strength of the conductance mechanism transition also increases, because the high electric field download stream transport process belongs to the local state in the amorphous region. The carrier transport mechanism under high electric field is dominated by electron hopping conductance [

 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The higher the crystallinity of polyethylene, the smaller the free volume and the smaller the free travel of electrons. Therefore, the field strength corresponding to the occurrence of the electrode limiting effect is higher.
