  <p>Crystal structure of bulk BiI
   <sub>3</sub> (left) compared to the experimentally elucidated structure model of BiI
   <sub>3</sub> film on Bi
   <sub>2</sub>Se
   <sub>3</sub>(0001) (right). The film consists of a complete first TL adjacent to the Bi
   <sub>2</sub>Se
   <sub>3</sub> (0001) surface and a second TL, which is only half filled. Iodine atoms are depicted in red, the bismuth atoms are color-coded in accordance with their shifts from the central position within the octahedra (traced by a dotted line). Atoms are numbered according to Table 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Interplanar distances and shifts of the bismuth atoms are given in Å. We estimate the uncertainty of the distance determination equal to 0.1 Å.
