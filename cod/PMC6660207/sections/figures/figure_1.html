 <caption> Schematics of the experiment and optical emission behavior of the 2D perovskite (PEA) 2PbI 4 under high pressure. ( A) Illustration of DAC and the mechanism of hydrostatic compression. ( B) A set of fluorescent microscopic images of a (PEA) 2PbI 4 crystal taken at the same lamp power. A bright-field image of the sample is presented in the center, surrounded by fluorescent images corresponding to different pressures. At 0 to 3.5 GPa, the fluorescence of (PEA) 2PbI 4 is equally bright, and the color is reversible by decompression. After 3.5 GPa, the fluorescence rapidly disappears and loses the reversibility. LP, low pressure; HP, high pressure. </caption>
