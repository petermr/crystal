<p id="Par25">Quite good agreement between HR-EBSD and CPFE (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(e,f)</xref>) is seen for both samples in terms of the geometry of the deformation field. However, CPFE predicts a slightly wider spread of the rotation field than measured by HR-EBSD. This may be attributed to stress release during FIB-lift-out preparation. Importantly, comparison of CPFE and HR-EBSD shows that the magnitude of the rotation field immediately below the indent is similar for both the implanted and unimplanted material. Thus, the major difference between the implanted and unimplanted material lies in the far-field rotations captured by Laue diffraction. It is worth noting that using only HR-EBSD or Laue diffraction could lead to incomplete measurement of the deformation field in the far-field or near the indent respectively. This underlines the importance of the use of complementary techniques for gaining a complete picture of crystal scale deformation at the nano-scale.
