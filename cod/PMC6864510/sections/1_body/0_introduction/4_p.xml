<p>2D and corrugated 2D organometallic halide perovskites are formed by splitting along lattice orientations 〈001〉 and 〈110〉 from 3D perovskites, which are identified as Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPPs) (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b,c).
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> The general chemical formula of 2D organometallic halide perovskites is (A′)

 <sup>2+</sup> or Sn
 <sup>2+</sup>) and X refers to halides. Symbol 
 <italic>n</italic> stands for the number of metal halide monolayer sheets in between the insulating A organic layers: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, strict 2D structure; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2–5, quasi‐2D structure; 
 <italic>n</italic> = ∞, conventional 3D structure.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Structurally, for the single ammonium cations, the terminal amine of organic cation interacts with halide of inorganic anion layer through hydrogen bonds, and the adjacent carbon chains of the organic cations are bound together by van der Waals force to form organic layers. For the diammonium cations, the two terminal amines are linked to the inorganic layer through hydrogen bonds.
