 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> shows nonresonant Raman spectra taken under different pressures. To avoid resonance excitation with the tunable PL, we alternatively used 1.96- and 2.33-eV laser lines. Vibration modes at low wave number are prominent in the spectra. All the modes notably blue-shift with increasing pressure. Low–wave number Raman modes less than 50 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were commonly used to determine molecular interactions and orientation of benzene rings (

 </xref>). Here, the low–wave number vibration modes can describe the interactions between the adjacent benzene rings located at different layers of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub>. The strong blue shift suggests that the intermolecular (interlayer) vibration frequency increases distinctly. Apparently, the interlayer interaction is enhanced, which is likely due to the reduction of interlayer distance during compression process. The shift of Raman modes is reversible at moderate pressure range (shown in fig. S6), which is in excellent agreement with the reversible region determined by PL measurements. It is notable that a split of Raman peaks is observed at 5.1 GPa, similar to the PL spectra at the same pressure. When the pressure reaches up to 6 GPa, the Raman modes and the PL vanish synchronously.
