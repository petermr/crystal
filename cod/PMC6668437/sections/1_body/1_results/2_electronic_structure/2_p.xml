<p id="Par12">A qualitatively different picture is observed in the case of YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Although bearing a certain degree of similarity with the simplified calculations, the Fermi surface looks continuous and has a fine structure. The intensity distribution recorded along the cut #1 also shows extremely fast and sharp in momentum states originated from the Bi net, as in EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>. Cut #2 runs through the additional FS elements and demonstrates the crucial dichotomy with the material containing Eu: the Dirac crossings appear to remain protected or the gap is much smaller. At particular photon energies (20.5, 27, 36, or 55 eV, Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) the experimental FS contour of YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> looks sharp and continuous, i.e., hole-like “lenses” are connected to small electron-like pockets near X-points, implying the survival of the Dirac crossings in the momentum regions where these two FS sheets appear to be separated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, at least for particular 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>. Here the crossings coincide with the Fermi level and large gaps would be detectable. The continuous shape of the Fermi surface Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> is the consequence of the protection of the Dirac crossings at least in some points along the Fermi surface contour. By symmetry considerations, these Dirac crossings should not exist in the presence of SOC and TRS and inversion symmetries. Given no evidence of structural transitions, it is likely that TRS is broken in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> also purely from the ARPES measurements of FS.
