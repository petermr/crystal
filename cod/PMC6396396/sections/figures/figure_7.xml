 <caption>
  <p>Section of the superspace model based on M40 #1 showing atomic domains relevant for Al/Si ordering. Displacive modulations are neglected here. Atomic domains that form part of the octahedra, 
   <italic>i.e.</italic> Al1, O1 and O2, are not shown. Different background colours indicate dicluster and tricluster units. The domains of Al2, Si2 and O3 are described by more than one block wavefunction.
