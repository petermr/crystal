<p id="Par25">Experiments up to 21.1 GPa were performed with a Boehler-Almax diamond anvil cell (DAC) (4θ~70°) in which a 10-µm-thick sample was introduced inside a 150 µm diameter hole of a stainless-steel gasket preindented to 40 µm. The pressure calibrant was a ruby chip and the pressure transmitting media were Ne and a 4:1 methanol:ethanol mixture. These experiments were done at the MSPD beamline at ALBA-CELLS synchrotron using a x-ray wavelength of 0.3185 Å (Ne as PTM) and at the P02.2 Extreme conditions beamline at PETRA III synchrotron, DESY, using a x-ray wavelength of 0.28973 Å (methanol:ethanol mixture as PTM). The maximum pressure in single-crystal runs was 21 GPa at ALBA-CELLS and 10.8 GPa at PETRA III. It has to be stressed out that few measurements resulted in succesful structural solution and satisfactory refinement relies (data measured at PETRA III). The diffraction images were collected by 0.5° ω scanning. The image format was converted for further processing with the CRYSALIS
