<p>As for the central-supported DRGs, the comparison of the natural frequencies at different geometry parameters obtained by the simulation and calculation are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f012">Figure 12</xref>. It can be seen that in the full ranges of geometry parameters the natural frequency error is also limited to ±15%. Errors come from both the simulation and calculation methods. The errors in simulation method mainly come from the meshing density of the structure. The errors in calculation method mainly come from the Euler–Bernoulli beam assumption, which is only suitable for the thin rings whose radius is much larger than the width.
