<p id="Par15">The 3D Pb-displacement correlations in the form of dense nanoscale regions are evident from considering the local alignment metric, 
 <italic>α</italic>, defined as the average of the angles between the displacement vectors of a given atom and each of its neighbors within a sphere of a certain radius. Figure

 </sup> to form dense, spatially distinct clusters (labeled using different colors). In this representation, PMN appears as an assemblage of regions, about 4–6 nm in size, featuring the locally aligned displacements; we will call these regions 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs. The displacements of Nb are strongly and positively correlated with those of Pb (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Presumably, these correlations are driven by the bonding requirements of the oxygen atoms.
