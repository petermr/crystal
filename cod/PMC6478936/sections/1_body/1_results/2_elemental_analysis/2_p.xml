<p id="Par14">Since the EDX setup did not allow for the detection of lithium, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) was performed to verify the lithium content of the phosphor. As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows, the ToF-SIMS analysis unambiguously detected Li with homogeneous distribution in the phosphor particle. In order to gain quantitative information concerning the composition, ToF-SIMS depth profiles were acquired from a phosphor particle, and also from a reference with known composition, namely Sr[LiAl
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>]. Within these depth profiles, the signal intensities of the Li
 <sup>+</sup> secondary ions, divided by the signal intensities of the Sr
 <sup>+</sup> secondary ions, approached a linear level in the phosphor bulk below the surface. As can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, the intensity of the Li
 <sup>+</sup> signal in SALON is higher than that of the Sr[LiAl
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>] reference by a factor of 2.4, which is close to 2. The remaining 0.4 difference can be attributed to matrix effects, which cannot be accounted for as there is no established reference available, due to the fact that SALON is the only known representative of this compound class. Hence, by combination of the EDX and ToF-SIMS results, taking electro-neutrality into account, the only possible composition of SALON was determined to be Sr[Li
 <sub>2</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>], which confirmed the results obtained from single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
