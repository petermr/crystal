 </sup>. The core-shell framework structure of hybrid nanoparticles offers ample opportunities to tune the physico-chemical properties and functionalities of the particles via controlling the size, shape, elemental composition, and structure of the metal core, together with the chemical composition of the ligand shell. The chemical interactions between the metal atoms and ligand molecules at the core-shell interface are in a crucial role since they dictate the atomic-scale structure, stability, and ensuing properties of the particle.
