<p>The current-voltage characteristics of the dielectric comply with Ohm’s law at low electric fields, i.e., at the beginning of pressurization. When the voltage (or electric field intensity) reaches a certain value 
 <italic>U
  <sub>Ω</sub>
 </italic> (or 
 <italic>E
  <sub>Ω</sub>
 </italic>), the concentration of the injected carriers will increase, accumulating a large amount of space charge and causing the space charge limited current. In this way, the current flowing through the dielectric is transformed from the region of ohmic current to the region of space charge limited current. When the field strength applied to the material exceeds the breakover field strength, a large accumulation of carriers and space charge limited current will occur in the insulation, which may cause various aging conditions. Thus, the breakover voltage 
 <italic>U
  <sub>Ω</sub>
 </italic> (or electric field intensity 
 <italic>E
  <sub>Ω</sub>
 </italic>) is sometimes referred to as the electric degradation threshold of the dielectric material, which is the ideal situation without traps. There are inevitably various traps for the actual dielectric materials as mentioned above. When there are traps, the trapping of the injected charge causes the breakover voltage to be much larger than when there is no trap, and the current is made smaller. As the voltage 
 <italic>U</italic> applied to the material increases, the amount of injected charge increases, and the traps in the material are gradually filled. When the voltage reaches a certain value 
 <italic>U
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>, the traps are filled, and the injected electrons will no longer cause trapping so that the current in the insulation increases so sharply that it turns to the region of space charge limited current without traps. At this time, the density 
 <italic>J</italic> of the space charge limited current follows Calder’s law with trap filling or without traps, as shown in
