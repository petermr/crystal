<p>We think the missing of the Mg(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> is due to the poor crystallinity, because the hydrolysis occurred at room temperature. Furthermore, the hydrolysis also indicates no passivation layer formation at the surface of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>. Even though the experimental protocol is not qualified to have quantitative discussions for the reaction kinetics, we think the hydrolysis is a good evidence to prove the passivation-free surface of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> never shows any hydrolysis even 72 h after the addition of the water, as if the surface of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> is well-passivated. However, there still remains a question whether the stability is really owing to the passivation layer or the stability of the bulk Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> phase, considering the chemical similarity between bismuth and antimony. Hence we attempted further acceleration of the hydrolysis by immersing the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> powders in excess amount of water. The formation of the Sb is slightly observed after 24 h storage in excess water, and we finally observed the clear evidence of the hydrolysis of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> after 10 days, as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>. The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> obviously showed much faster hydrolysis compared with the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> and the hydrolysis is almost completed after 6 days storage. The hydrolysis of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> proves that the formation of the thermodynamically stable intermetallic phase suppress the formation of the passivation layer. As a consequence, an electrochemically active electrode/electrolyte interphase is maintained. We also attribute that the electrochemical activity of the intermetallic anode is highly dependent upon the reaction kinetics, because the hydrolysis of the intermetallics is fundamentally same as the electrochemical reaction. In the hydrolysis process of the intermetallic anodes, the reduction of the proton in the water initiates the oxidation of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> or the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> associated with the extraction of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> in the host structure. The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> still remains even after the 10 days of the reaction, while the hydrolysis of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> is mostly completed after &lt; 6 days as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>. It clearly shows the reaction kinetics of the hydrolysis process of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> is much faster than that of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub>. Even without the quantitative discussion, the fast reaction kinetics of the hydrolysis process well matches with the electrochemical activity of the intermetallic anodes.
