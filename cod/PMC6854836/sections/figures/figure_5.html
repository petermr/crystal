 <caption> SEM backscattered electron images of reacted pellets revealing various stages of α-SiB 3– x /β-SiB 3 formation. For a homogenously dense sample, areas with bright and dark contrast correspond to Si- and B-rich compositions, respectively. (a) Nano-Si/B = 1:4 at 1175 °C after 16 h: onset of α-SiB 3– x formation. White, dark, and medium gray areas correspond to agglomerated nano-Si, crystallized amorphous boron, and irregularly shaped, wormlike, α-SiB 3– x particles, respectively. (b) Micron-Si/B = 1:4 at 1200 °C after 24 h: Si particles with a B-saturated rim and irregularly shaped, wormlike, α-SiB 3– x particles. (c) Nano-Si/B = 1:3 at 1200 °C after 40 h: roentgenographically pure α-SiB 3– x sample, consisting of larger crystals (brighter) and smaller particles (darker). Areas in between α-SiB 3– x crystals and particles appear darker due to a lower sample density. (d) Nano-Si/B = 1:4 at 1175 °C after 40 h: the sample constitutes β-SiB 3 crystals, irregularly shaped α-SiB 3– x particles, and crystallized excess boron (dark gray areas). The smaller inset shows a β-SiB 3 crystal with boron-rich inclusions; the larger inset shows an optical micrograph of the cross section polished sample. The reddish β-SiB 3 crystals are clearly visible. </caption>
