 <italic>Z-</italic>
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <italic>E-</italic>
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>) were synthesized by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of 3-pyridinylboronic acid with an 
 <italic>E</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic> mixture of reported overcrowded alkene precursors [
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref> for full experimental details). Heating a 2:1 mixture of ligands (
 <italic>S,S</italic>)-
 <italic>Z-</italic>
 <bold>1</bold> or (
 <italic>S,S</italic>)-
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> with Pd(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> in acetonitrile at reflux led to the quantitative formation of cage Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> or Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively, as evidenced by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, DOSY and HRMS. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals of the pyridine moieties of the ligands (H
 <sub>a–d</sub>) in the assembled cages are shifted downfield compared to those of the free ligands, as expected due to metal coordination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As the ligand exchange in Pd
 <sub>2</sub>L
 <sub>4</sub> complexes is slow on the NMR timescale, the discrete signals do not represent an average of quickly interconverting isomers [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The formation of cage complexes using a racemic mixture of ligands stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> or stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>, resulted in the exact same 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum as was obtained with the enantiopure ligands. Using a racemic mixture of ligands, four different diastereomeric cages can be formed ((

 <sub>4</sub>, (
 <italic>S</italic>,
 <italic>S</italic>)
 <sub>3</sub>(
 <italic>R,R</italic>), (

 <sub>2</sub>(

 <sub>2</sub> and (

 <italic>S</italic>)(
 <italic>R</italic>,
 <italic>R</italic>)(
 <italic>S,S</italic>)(
 <italic>R,R</italic>) and their enantiomeric pairs). However, in both cases, only one set of signals is observed, which is a strong indication that only one species with high symmetry is formed by chiral self-sorting without any sign of the formation of diastereomeric mixtures. To further confirm the self-sorting behavior of these cage structures, CD spectroscopy was performed. A linear dependence of CD amplitude on the ee of ligand stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> was found, which can be expected when the homochiral enantiomers of cage structure Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> are the only optically active species in solution (Figure S1,
