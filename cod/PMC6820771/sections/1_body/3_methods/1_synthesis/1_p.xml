<p id="Par22">1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> was prepared using a stoichiometric mixture of elemental molybdenum (Sigma Aldrich, 99.95%) and tellurium (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%). The powders were sealed under a vacuum pressure of 4.5 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> mbar in a quartz ampoule which was carefully shaken in order to homogenize the mixture. The nanocrystalline phase was prepared by heating at 400 °C for 16 h before being allowed to cool to room temperature. The materials were reground and reannealed using the same heating protocols before being characterised. 2H-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> was synthesised by reannealing 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> at 700 °C (temperature ramp of 5 °C per min) for 24 h and cooling naturally to room temperature.
