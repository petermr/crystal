<p>The Platonic solids have been known since the ancient Greeks. They include the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron. In previous tables, we have listed magic formulas for fcc and bcc cubes and octahedra. Here we list the formulas for the icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and body-centered tetrahedron. As previously mentioned in the “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section, the dodecahedron is unique for the clusters analyzed here, in that

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b that the outer shell contains both fivefold and sixfold coordinated atoms. When a shell becomes internal, those five- and sixfold coordinated atoms become seven- and eightfold coordinated with bonds to a shell on either side. Also, the sixfold coordinated outside shell atoms are sevenfold coordinated by bonding to the shell inside. Thus there are sevenfold surface and bulk coordinated atoms for the dodecahedron. Each shell in the structure has 12 fivefold shell atoms, which produce 12
