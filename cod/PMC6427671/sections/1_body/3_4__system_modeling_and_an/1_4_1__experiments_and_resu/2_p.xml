<p>The 8502 piezoelectric pressure sensor, produced by Qi Shi Yuan (Mianyang, China), is widely used in the transient pressure testing. Therefore, it was selected as the test pressure sensor. The 8309 piezoelectric accelerometer (Kistler, Switzerland) which has a sensitivity of 0.04 pC/
 <italic>g</italic> was selected to measure the additional acceleration. During the test, the 8502 and 8309 sensors were rigidly fixed in the Machete hammer. When the acceleration signal was generated, the output charge of the two sensors were converted into voltage signals by the Kistler charge amplifier 5011, which had a 3 dB bandwidth of 200 KHz, then a high-speed multi-channel oscilloscope whose sampling frequency of data acquisition was 100 MHz, and was adopted to record the pressure and acceleration signal data. The experimental outcomes are detailed in
