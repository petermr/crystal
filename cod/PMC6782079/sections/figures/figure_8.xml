  <p>(
   <italic>a</italic>) Rietveld refinement of 1.22 g of LiKHC
   <sub>6</sub>H
   <sub>5</sub>O
   <sub>7</sub> loaded in a 6 mm V can and measured for 2.6 h in the sample changer using a center wavelength of 2.665 Å at room temperature. Light-blue dots represent measured data, the royal-blue line is the model fit to the data and the black line is the difference curve. Tick marks show the locations of the expected Bragg peaks. (
   <italic>b</italic>) The Fourier density of the missing hydrogen is overlaid on the DFT-calculated hydrogen location.
