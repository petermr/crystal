<p id="Par6">In this work, we reported the design and synthesis of a TPE-based 3D COF, named 3D-TPE-COF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our result clearly shows that the 3D-TPE-COF is a microporous material with high surface area, and by using the newly developed continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) method, 3D-TPE-COF is identified to adopt a seven-fold interpenetrated 
 <bold>pts</bold> (the net of the platinum and sulfur atoms in PtS) topology with

 <italic>c</italic> space group. Interestingly, 3D-TPE-COF emits yellow fluorescence upon excitation, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 20%. Moreover, by simply coating 3D-TPE-COF onto a commercial blue light-emitting diode (LED), a prototype white LED (WLED) was fabricated. The Commission International de I’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of COF-based WLED were determined to be (0.30, 0.35), which are close to that of the pure white light. In addition, this WLED exhibited no degradation after aging for 1200 h at ambient condition.
