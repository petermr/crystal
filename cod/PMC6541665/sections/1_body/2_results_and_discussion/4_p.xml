 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a–c show the CIE chromaticity diagram of 120° mini-CSPLED BLU, 150° mini-CSPLED BLU, and 180° mini-CSPLED BLU with different QD film thicknesses. The CIE chromaticity coordinates (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) of the three kinds of mini-CSPLED BLUs with different QD film thicknesses were measured as follows:(
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) = (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.1977 − 0.2525, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.1297 − 0.2284), (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) = (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.1941 − 0.2478, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.1239 − 0.2295), and (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) = (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.1947 − 0.2496, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.1328 − 0.2331), respectively. It was clear that the emission chromaticity coordinates of the corresponding BLU with QD films of various thicknesses exhibiting CIE chromaticity coordinates were located near the blue region. As the QD film thickness increases, the CIE chromaticity coordinates shift toward the white region. In addition, the BLU brightness increases as the QD film thickness increases from 60, 90, and 150 μm. This result was attributed to the significant increases the excitation probability with thick QD films to produce white light and increase brightness. On the other hand, the BLU brightness of the 180° mini-CSPLED BLU was significantly lowered, which may be attributed to the average brightness decrease as a result of the larger illumination area. The results of this study show the CIE chromaticity coordinates (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) and brightness for the three kinds of mini-CSPLED emission angle structure with different QD film thicknesses and are summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>,
