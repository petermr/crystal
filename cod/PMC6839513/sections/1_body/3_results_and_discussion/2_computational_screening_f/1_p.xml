 </sup> Interestingly, two different types of disorder have been described. The first two structure solutions (PHYDAN

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
 </sup> and PHYDAN01
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
 </sup>) report a small disorder in the two phenyl ring positions which can be related to the minimal intramolecular energy cost required for their rotation within a conformational energy well (

The disorder described is in agreement with the observation seen in the PHYDAN03

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
 </sup> structure; i.e., the phenyl rings show high thermal motion as derived from the atomic displacement parameters of the atoms. The structure solution PHYDAN02
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>
 </sup> shows directional disorder, i.e., oppositely directed H-bonded networks of the hydration moiety. Regardless of the H-bond orientation, the packing is maintained.
