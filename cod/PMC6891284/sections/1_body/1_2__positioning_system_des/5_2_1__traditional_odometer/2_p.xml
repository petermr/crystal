<p>It is assumed that the trajectory of the food delivery robot is a segment of an arc, and if the rotation speed of the food delivery robot is zero, which means that the speeds of the left and right wheels are equal, the trajectory of movement of the robot is a straight line. Assume that the two-wheel distance of the food delivery robot is
