<p>The secondary structure and global architecture of the 
 <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II riboswitch aptamer domain (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>) adopts the same three-way junction supported by a distal tertiary interaction observed in all structures of purine family riboswitches (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref>). Superimposition of the 
 <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> guanine and 
 <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II aptamers reveals that the three helices are organized around the central three-way junction in an identical fashion (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The main architectural difference between the two RNAs is the presence of an additional base pair in the 
 <italic>env1</italic> P3 helix (seven versus six base pairs in 
 <italic>xpt</italic>)—similar to the 
 <italic>M. florum</italic> 2′-dG-I aptamer. To preserve critical tertiary loop contacts between L2 and L3, this additional base pair shifts the P3 helix further into the binding core relative to 
 <italic>xpt</italic> in both the 2′-dG-I (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and 2′-dG-II RNAs. However, it should be noted that a seven base pair P3 helix is common within the guanine class of purine family riboswitches as well (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), so this feature is not unique to 2′-deoxyguanosine binding.
