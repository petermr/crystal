<p>As the vanishing susceptibility of the iron(III) compound suggest antiferromagnetic coupling, neutron diffraction data were collected for

  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> powder samples at 4 and 300 K (Figure S22 and S23, Table S4 and S5, Supporting Information). The diffraction patterns for both temperatures are nearly identical, confirming the constant magnetic behavior between 1.8 and 300 K seen in magnetization and Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements. Rietveld refinements, including the magnetic scattering intensities, led to a spin structure with the magnetic space group 
 <italic>Pbc</italic>′
 <italic>a</italic>′; the propagation vector 
 <italic>k</italic> equals [000]. The moments of the iron atoms are roughly aligned along [010], i. e. nearly perpendicular to the ferrate layers and antiferromagnetically coupled to their three neighbors via oxygen super‐exchange (Figure 
 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The distributions of the magnetic and nuclear intensities for the measurements at 4 k and 300 k are given in Figures S24 and S25 of the Supporting Information.
