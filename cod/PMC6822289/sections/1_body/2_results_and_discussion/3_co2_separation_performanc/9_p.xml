 </sup> In the present work, the lowest parasitic energies are obtained in the range of the Henry coefficient between 10
 <sup>–4</sup> and 10
 <sup>–3</sup> mol/(kg Pa). These results are coherent with the earlier findings on other materials. However, the Henry coefficient for COFs rarely exceeds 10
 <sup>–4</sup> mol/(kg Pa), and none were found to exceed 10
 <sup>–3</sup> mol/(kg Pa). Our effort consistently extends the “materials genome” for carbon capture and sequestration, now including also COFs. When compared with the best material found in the work of Huck et al.,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
 </sup> we observe that the performances of these COFs are still below the best performer MOF-74, for which we get 0.705 MJ per kg of CO
 <sub>2</sub>, with a purity of 0.943 and a volumetric working capacity of 64.87 kg of CO
 <sub>2</sub> per cubic meter of bed. In total, 14 materials over 60 were indicated by Huck et al. to have a low parasitic energy for coal flue gas (in the range 0.7–0.85 MJ/kg), including 6 cation exchanged zeolites, 5 MOFs, and 3 porous polymers. However, the consideration that COF materials contain only light atoms, being potentially cheap, can be an important criterion of choice, making this class of materials appealing for CO
 <sub>2</sub> separation.
