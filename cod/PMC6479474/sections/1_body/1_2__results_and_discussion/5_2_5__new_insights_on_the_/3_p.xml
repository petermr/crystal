<p>In more detail, the influential spectral regions in chemometric analysis of melamine content in milk powders based on NIR spectroscopy has been reported by Lim et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. They have found that the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models have recognized 6763 and 6808 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> as the most meaningful in the analysis. They have concluded that these regions correspond to 6676 and 6529 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> peaks of melamine observed in the spectrum of milk powder. We may now confirm that these two bands arise from the first overtones and binary combinations of

 <sub>s</sub>NH
 <sub>2</sub> modes of melamine, respectively. These previous chemometric analyses consistently indicate that for the detection and quantification of melamine, its NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching vibrations are the most meaningful; however, we may now indicate that not only the first overtones, but also binary combinations equally contribute. On the other hand, the lower NIR region, where combination bands due to NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching and deformation modes of melamine are present, is less essential.
