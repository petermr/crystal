 <italic>x</italic>Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %) at different Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> doping concentrations monitored at 688 nm. It can be seen that the PLE spectra of all samples did not change significantly except for the PLE intensity.

 </xref>b shows the corresponding PL spectra of the BGT:
 <italic>x</italic>Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %) samples upon 358 nm excitation. All of the PL spectra of these samples were similar to each other except for the PL intensity. The PL intensity of BGT:
 <italic>x</italic>Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors increased first with increasing Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ion concentration, approached a maximum at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.6%, and then dropped as 
 <italic>x</italic> exceeded 0.6%, as observed in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>c. This phenomenon was known as the concentration quenching effect, which was caused by the energy transfer between the nearest Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions.

 </sup> The critical transfer distance (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>) between the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions in BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors can be estimated by the following formula

 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>V</italic> is to the unit cell volume, 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> is the critical doping concentration, and 
 <italic>N</italic> is the number of available sites for the dopant in the unit cell. For BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors, 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0.6%, 
 <italic>V</italic> = 307.202(5) Å
 <sup>3</sup>, and 
 <italic>N</italic> = 2, respectively. The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> value was determined to be 36.57 Å, which was much higher than 5 Å. Hence, it was inferred that the energy transfer mechanism of the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions in the BGT host was dominated by the electric multipolar interaction because the exchange interaction works only at shorter distances (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> &lt; 5 Å).

 </sup> To further confirm the detailed interaction mechanism between the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions, the relationship between log(
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>x</italic>) and log(
 <italic>x</italic>) could be expressed by the following equation

  <label>2</label>
 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>I</italic> is the emission intensity of BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors; 
 <italic>x</italic> is the concentration of the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions; and 
 <italic>K</italic> and β are the constants for the same excitation condition. An index of the electric multipolar character, θ = 6, 8, and 10 correspond to the dipole–dipole, dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole interactions, respectively.

 </xref>d depicts the dependence of log(
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>x</italic>) on log(
 <italic>x</italic>). It was observed that the slope of the fitted straight line (−θ/3) was −1.6036, thus the value of θ was 4.8108. The value of θ was approximately 6, suggesting that the major concentration quenching mechanism in BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors was electric dipole–dipole reaction.
