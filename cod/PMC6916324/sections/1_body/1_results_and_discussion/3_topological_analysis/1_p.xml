It allows for the description of aspherical ED by spherical harmonics, in which the total density is partitioned in a spherical core density, a spherical valence, and an aspherical deformation valence density. To describe the aspherical density, local coordinate systems are necessary. We used DFT calculations, together with manual judgment, to determine the pertinent local coordinate systems, because the actual coordination polyhedra around the Co ions in Co
 <sub>3</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> are distorted from the ideal polyhedra (for details see the Supporting Information). The definition of the local coordinate systems is found in Figure

In the Bader methodology, the presence of bond‐critical points (BCP) in the molecular graph is a prerequisite for an interaction between two atoms. The features at the BCP are also an indication for the bonding type and the strength of a bond, which might correlate with the distance.
