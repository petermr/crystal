This compound has the unique ability to adsorb water from the air, which then decomposes into the oxygen and the hydrogen. The oxygen is embedded in the interlayer space PLS forming a layered compound with a greater thickness of the perovskite layer. The hydrogen evaporates, and its output is much greater than during adsorption and decomposition of water by the compound Ca
