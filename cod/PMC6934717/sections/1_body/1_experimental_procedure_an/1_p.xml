 <sub>N</sub> = 175 K (‘crystal b’). The chemical composition of these crystals was measured with a Hitachi S3400 scanning electron microscope operating at 20 kV. Three spots (each ∼80 μm area) were checked and averaged on each crystal; energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and site-refinement of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that both crystals are stoichiometric and are EuFe
