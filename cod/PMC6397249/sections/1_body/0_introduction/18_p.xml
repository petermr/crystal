<p id="Par19">The CIELAB color coordinates of the 20 mm × 20 mm × 1 mm plate coupons are measured in color space by an optical spectrophotometer on the plate coupons (see Methods). The measured CIELAB coordinates are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> (see Supplemental Information). The CIELAB coordinates of the primary-Au Au
 <sub>65.2</sub>Cu
 <sub>22.4</sub>Ag
 <sub>12.4</sub> are consistent with a yellow color, and falls within the “yellow” region of the Au-Cu-Ag color map (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, Supplemental Information). This demonstrates that the color of the primary-Au phase in the MGMCs is fixed by the choice of the Ag and Cu concentrations to a custom yellow color. In principle, by choosing different Cu and Ag concentrations one may potentially achieve any color in the Au-Cu-Ag color map. On the other hand, the CIELAB coordinates of the monolithic metallic glass Au
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>25.5</sub>Ag
 <sub>3</sub>Pd
 <sub>3</sub>Si
 <sub>18.5</sub> are consistent with a pale white color. The pale white color is mostly a consequence of a high Si content along with modest Pd content, as both Si and Pd are known to “bleach” the color of gold alloys. Changing the concentrations of Ag and Cu in the overall alloy in order to influence the color of the primary-Au phase, as discussed above, has little impact on the color of the metallic glass phase, which likely remains pale white due to the high Si and Pd contents.
