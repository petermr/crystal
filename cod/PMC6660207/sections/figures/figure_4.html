 <caption> Structural evolution and strongly anisotropic compression of (PEA) 2PbI 4 under pressure. All data are derived from XRD spectra and supported by first-principles calculation. ( A) Synchrotron radiation XRD spectra of 2D perovskite under pressure. ( B) Pressure dependence of unit cell volume. The volume change is represented in the form of V/ V 0, in which V 0 is the initial volume at ambient pressure. The volume compression process is well fitted by Birch-Murnaghan equation. ( C) Pressure dependence of the Pb─I bond length, which is slightly different in in-plane (&lt;Pb─I&gt; equatorial) and out-of-plane (&lt;Pb─I&gt; axial) directions. ( D) Pressure dependence of unit cell parameters: a, b, and c. It is obvious that compression of c is visibly stronger than a and b, which are almost unchanged along pressure change. ( E) Identical pressure dependence of a, b, and c is confirmed by first-principles calculation, which enhances the observation of anisotropic compression. </caption>
