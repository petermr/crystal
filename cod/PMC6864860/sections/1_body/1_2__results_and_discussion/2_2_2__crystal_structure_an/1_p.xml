<p>As observed in the three co-crystals, four typical hetero-synthons (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-24-03936-sch002">Scheme 2</xref>) were formed due to the strong hydrogen bonding network which involves the amino group, the carboxylic acid, and the hydroxyl group as donors and the carbonyl group (cycloketo and acetyl) as acceptors. These hydrogen bonding interactions strengthen the stability of the three co-crystals.
