In the presence of two polarons and a vacancy, the polaronic distortions might interact and therefore affect the total energy, geometry and position of the gap state. This structural feature appears consistently in all of the calculations presented here and can thus be considered to be insensitive to the approximation of the electronic exchange and correlation.
