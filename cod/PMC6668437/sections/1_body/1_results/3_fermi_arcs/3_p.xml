<p id="Par19">We briefly discuss other possible explanations of the unusual behavior seen in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>. We would like to immediately exclude the possible presence of slightly disoriented crystallites. First, the single crystals are of exceptional quality and at no stage during their characterization have we noticed the presence of such crystallites. Second, in this case one would observe doubling of all the features and we see only three. We also believe that the combined influence of finite 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>-resolution and 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>-dispersion cannot be responsible for the observed effect (the 
 <italic>z</italic>-axis is perpendicular to the surface). The width of the linear dispersing features is resolution limited for all used photon energies (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>) and 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>-dispersion related artifacts are usually much broader and not that clearly separated. In addition, the 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>z</sub>-dispersion is very similar in Eu-containing material (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and there we do not see any evidence for additional features. Finally, we rule out the “technical” influence of the surface, such as relaxation

 </sup>, since, again, EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> cleaves in a similar way and there one would expect more surface-related problems because of much larger magnetic moments. We stress here that the decisive experimental fact, which speaks in favor of our interpretation, is the number of features at the Fermi level: any kind of artifact, including the relaxed surface, would produce a replica of the “lens” and thus double the number of crossings. We observe a “lens” and an arc, and the dispersion corresponding to the flat part of the former is a single feature at all photon energies (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). Previous ARPES study on closely related materials SrMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> and CaMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> isostructural to EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively, did not reveal any surface states, but strongly anisotropic Dirac dispersions
