<p>We performed the cell optimization for the 310 COFs that do not contain counterions in their pores (i.e., labeled as N, neutral). As we reported in the previous section, most of the problems in the DFT optimization routine were solved after a careful inspection and fixing of the initial structures. The problems that could be effectively attributed to the DFT implementation are related to only two structures: 18081N2 and 18082N2. These two both have cobalt, and they need electron smearing in the SCF: even testing different input parameters (e.g, lower mixing alpha, spin state, etc.) did not lead to a successful optimization. Considering that cobaltâ€™s pseudopotential is designed for 17 valence electrons (the largest number of electrons in the set we used), this is known to be a challenging element for the SCF diagonalization, and some effort is needed to design a more effective protocol for this particular element. However, AiiDA allowed the full tracking of the problem and reporting of the issue to the CP2K developers.</p>
