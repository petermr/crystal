<p>The Raman spectra of the prepared photocatalysts are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f005">Figure 5</xref>b. The characteristic peaks at 141.6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 396.3 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 516.4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 638.9 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> correspond to the anatase phase [
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but there are no characteristic peaks of the rutile phase and iron-related phase except for the four peaks of the anatase phase. Compared with pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, it is found that the Raman shift does not change after Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> doping, but the peak intensity and peak width change in varying degrees; in particular, the peak intensity of 5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> decreases and the peak width increases, indicating that Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> replacing Ti
 <sup>4+</sup> in the lattice results in the increase of lattice distortion and peak width, while the inhibition of crystal transformation weakens the peak intensity. This conclusion is consistent with the analysis of XRD patterns.
