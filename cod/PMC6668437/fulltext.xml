While the presence of Dirac and noncentrosymmetric Weyl fermions is well established in many materials, the magnetic Weyl semimetals still escape direct experimental detection. In order to find a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl state we design two materials and present here experimental and theoretical evidence of realization of such a state in one of them, YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>. We model the time-reversal symmetry breaking observed by magnetization and magneto-optical microscopy measurements by canted antiferromagnetism and find a number of Weyl points. Using angle-resolved photoemission, we directly observe two pairs of Weyl points connected by the Fermi arcs. Our results not only provide a fundamental link between the two areas of physics, but also demonstrate the practical way to design novel materials with exotic properties.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Candidate materials containing magnetic Weyl fermions remain rare.

First 3D-Dirac semimetals have been experimentally realized in Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>3</sub>Bi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, but to observe Weyl fermions, the degeneracy of the electronic states should be lifted and 3D-Dirac point should effectively become split. In this case the Schr&#x000f6;dinger equation will be similar to a two-component Weyl equation, and the electrons in this state will behave as Weyl fermions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These requirements can be fulfilled either in noncentrosymmetric or in magnetic materials with strong spin&#x02013;orbit interaction. Many compounds have been nominated to host this exotic state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and the evidence for Weyl fermions and Fermi arcs has been found in noncentrosymmetric crystals<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, in spite of numerous theoretical predictions and intense experimental search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, magnetic Weyl semimetals could not be spectroscopically identified.</p><p id="Par4">One possible recipe would be to select materials that contain structural elements capable of generating the required electronic structure, focusing on magnetic systems with a center of inversion. The most simple and well-known generator of the Dirac-like massless relativistic dispersions is the 2D network of Bi atoms. These layers should be then separated by other blocks containing magnetic ions to break the time-reversal symmetry (TRS). To ensure direct spectroscopic observation of the Weyl state by angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) one would choose to stay close to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to avoid strongly magnetized domains which would influence the photoelectrons. This role could be perfectly played by manganese atoms, which tend to order antiferromagnetically. Finally, in order to avoid a perfect AFM, which formally breaks TRS but does not lift the degeneracy, strongly magnetic ions of rare earth elements should be introduced to the lattice as well.</p><p id="Par5">On the basis of these considerations we have grown single crystals of EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> (a previously reported compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>) and YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> (not a previously reported compound). Our ARPES, magnetization and magneto-optical microscopy measurements clearly demonstrate the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in one of the materials, YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>, in excellent agreement with the calculations considering a canted antiferromagnetic order. Two kinds of fully relativistic calculations reveal a number of Weyl points and predict YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> to be the first canted antiferromagnet hosting a magnetic Weyl state of the second type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We detect the Weyl points as well as an extra state (Fermi arc) of the Fermi surface both experimentally by ARPES and theoretically by semi-infinite-slab calculations. Our findings provide evidence for a TRS-breaking-induced type-II Weyl state that is present in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization and band-structure calculations</title><p id="Par6">In Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1</xref> we present the crystal and electronic structures of both materials as well as some of their basic physical properties. EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> crystallize in I4/mmm and P4/nmm structures, respectively, which are very similar, but with an important difference in mutual arrangement of the basic structural units. EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> has a body-centered and YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> has a primitive tetragonal lattice. Because of this difference the square Bi net (green atoms, Bi2) contains a mirror plane in the former and a glide plane in the latter, and the corresponding symmetry of the perturbing potential drastically alters the pristine dispersions of the states originating from the square Bi nets. In addition, the magnetic moment of Eu ions is considerably larger than that of the Yb ions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Calculated electronic structure and basic properties of EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>. <bold>a</bold> Crystal structures of both materials together with the corresponding Brillouin Zones.

Both compounds are metallic and have large, non-classical magnetoresistances as seen for other AMnBi<sub>2</sub> compounds. In EuMnBi<sub>2</sub>, a sharp feature in the magnetoresistance is seen due to a metamagnetic transition in the Eu sublattice, as reported in ref.&#x000a0;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. For EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> the magnetism below 300&#x02009;K is only due to the Eu moments as the Mn moments are locked antiferromagnetically. Additional ordering of Eu atoms seen in resistivity at ~20&#x02009;K implies that the ground state of EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> is well defined and all magnetic moments, Mn and Eu, are antiferromagnetically ordered. There is no hysteresis in any of the measurements.</p><p id="Par8">In the YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> compound we see no strong magnetism between 50 and 300&#x02009;K, however, below 50&#x02009;K new features in the magnetization develop. We show MH curves for YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>. The behavior above 20,000&#x02009;Oe should be all bulk effects and the curves for 300, 200, 100, and 50&#x02009;K only show a very weak either diamagnetic or weak paramagnetic response to the field above 20,000&#x02009;Oe. This implies the spins are locked in possibly perfect AFM order, as in EuMnBi<sub>2</sub>. However, as we get to low temperature, the magnetic response picks up and becomes significantly more anisotropic signaling some new spin degrees of freedom. This would be a disruption of perfect antiferromagnetism due to, e.g., canting and is an evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par9">We performed different types of band-structure calculations using the two methods: linear muffin-tin orbitals (LMTO) and full-potential local-orbitals (FPLO). First, we discuss the results of the former method. Corresponding Brillouin zones (BZ) are shown in the insets to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. In order to understand general aspects of the electronic structure of both materials, we first carried out calculations treating both Mn and rare earth originated states as quasi-core. When spin&#x02013;orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, this approach yielded the linear dispersions generated almost exclusively by Bi2 <italic>p</italic> states, which cross near or at the Fermi level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This is because the corresponding bandwidth is large and the band is centered at the Fermi level. The momentum locus of such symmetry protected Dirac crossings is indicated inside the BZ as a green loop for YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>, a line and a point for EuMnBi<sub>2</sub>. Exactly such elements are needed to construct a Weyl state and both compounds indeed demonstrate a number of Dirac dispersions using this simple approach (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). At all other points the crossings are not protected and the energy gap opens. Since otherwise the Bi networks are identical, it is also clear from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> that staggered geometry of the Yb atoms with respect to Bi net protects more Dirac crossings in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> (nodal loop) than the coincident geometry of Eu atoms in EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> (nodal line and point).</p><p id="Par10">The next step is to include the Mn <italic>d</italic> magnetism and spin&#x02013;orbit coupling to the computational scheme. As a first approximation, we consider the ordering of Mn moments as perfectly antiferromagnetic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and neglect the contributions of the 4<italic>f</italic> states of rare earth ions which are still treated as non-spin-polarized quasi-core states. The results of the fully relativistic band-structure calculations are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. Three bands contribute to the formation of the Fermi surface (FS), 2D cross-sections of which are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. Green and blue dispersions correspond mostly to Mn states while the red one represents discussed above Bi <italic>p</italic>-states. As is seen, spin&#x02013;orbit and exchange interactions make the Dirac electronic states &#x0201c;massive&#x0201d; in both materials, i.e., opens the gaps in most parts of the BZ. Again, there are important differences. While the gap is equally large (~0.2&#x02009;eV) across the BZ in EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> creating isolated &#x0201c;lenses&#x0201d; of FS, the gap in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> is smaller (down to ~10&#x02009;meV along the &#x00393;M line), adding to the &#x0201c;lenses&#x0201d; small electron-like pockets near the X-points. The distinct separation of these two portions of the FS signals the opening of the gap also in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> and, in particular, breaking of the nodal loop (green contour in upper BZ sketch in Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but above E<sub>F</sub> one crossing is preserved as is seen from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> where the red and blue dispersions touch each other along &#x00393;M direction. We have found in total four 3D-Dirac points in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> with the coordinates (&#x000b1;0.193, &#x000b1;0.193, 0.015) and (&#x000b1;0.193, &#x000b1;0.193, &#x02212;0.015), which are schematically shown in lower BZ sketch in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> as green points (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electronic structure</title><p id="Par11">In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> we present the results of comparative study of Fermi surfaces and underlying dispersions by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The FS of EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) is remarkably similar to that resulted from the simplified calculations shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, apart from that Mn-states are absent at the Fermi level. This is not surprising since their computed energy localization is very sensitive to the value of the U parameter usually used to correctly reproduce the correlated nature of Mn <italic>3d</italic> states. The well separated four lenses with sharp corners are clearly observed and depend only weakly on photon energy (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) confirming their origin from Bi <italic>p</italic> states from the two-dimensional square net.

Although bearing a certain degree of similarity with the simplified calculations, the Fermi surface looks continuous and has a fine structure. The intensity distribution recorded along the cut #1 also shows extremely fast and sharp in momentum states originated from the Bi net, as in EuMnBi<sub>2</sub>. Cut #2 runs through the additional FS elements and demonstrates the crucial dichotomy with the material containing Eu: the Dirac crossings appear to remain protected or the gap is much smaller. At particular photon energies (20.5, 27, 36, or 55&#x02009;eV, Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) the experimental FS contour of YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> looks sharp and continuous, i.e., hole-like &#x0201c;lenses&#x0201d; are connected to small electron-like pockets near X-points, implying the survival of the Dirac crossings in the momentum regions where these two FS sheets appear to be separated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, at least for particular <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>. Here the crossings coincide with the Fermi level and large gaps would be detectable. The continuous shape of the Fermi surface Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> is the consequence of the protection of the Dirac crossings at least in some points along the Fermi surface contour. By symmetry considerations, these Dirac crossings should not exist in the presence of SOC and TRS and inversion symmetries. Given no evidence of structural transitions, it is likely that TRS is broken in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> also purely from the ARPES measurements of FS.</p><p id="Par13">Obviously, it is instructive to take the data along the cut, which contains these special momentum regions. The next panel of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> (cut #3) represents a crucial dataset, which underlines the exotic electronic structure of YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> and directly proves the presence of the doubly (not quarterly) degenerate Dirac points, i.e., the long sought Weyl points. The first striking observation is that the Bi dispersions appear to be non-spin-degenerate in this particular region of the BZ. This breaking of the spin-degeneracy is key, and is not consistent with the AFM calculations. Indeed, the dispersion is seen to split between 100 and 200&#x02009;meV binding energy and only one pair of split features is gapped while the other still reaches the Fermi level where they clearly cross. It is these crossing points sitting at the Fermi level are the essential components of the electronic structure of a Weyl semimetal. Since these points are also the places where the electron-like FS touches the hole-like FS, YbMnBi2 is a canonical example of type-II Weyl semimetal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We note that we managed to observe such a clear picture of crossing of non-degenerate bands only at particular photon energies (20, 27, and 31&#x02009;eV, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">The pronounced dichotomy between EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> in terms of degeneracy of the electronic states should be detectable by other experiments. We have studied both single crystals by means of magneto-optical microscopy. By employing a Kerr microscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which is adjusted to be sensitive to the Voigt effect at perpendicular light incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, it turned out to be possible to visualize areas (&#x0201c;domains&#x0201d;) with different in-plane FM component of the Mn magnetization. This is demonstrated in the left column of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. If domains show up with maximum contrast at a given sample orientation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), the contrast disappears upon sample rotation by 45&#x000b0;. This contrast symmetry is in agreement with the Voigt effect that is quadratic in the in-plane component of the magnetization (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Since the measurements were carried out in zero magnetic field, it follows from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, that the averaging of the observed domains over the whole bulk sample will not result in significant net magnetization. Contrary to YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>, no contrast can be observed at any sample orientation in case of the EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> crystal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) as expected for a pure AFM in which the magnetic moments are aligned strictly perpendicular to the sample surface with no canting. The observed domain contrast in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> cannot arise from structural features as the samples are single crystals and the cleavage planes of both materials are the same (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The record sharpness of the quasi-2D ARPES features leaves no doubt as for their quality. The particular magnetic domain structure observed in the sample is most likely formed during the crystal growth process.</p><p id="Par15">In order to understand the presence of the FM domains, magnetism seen in the MH curves and the origin of the observed lifting of the degeneracy by ARPES (TRS breaking), we have carried out calculations considering several types of canted antiferromagnetism of the Mn atoms&#x02014;both with in-plane and out-of-plane ferromagnetic components. Remarkably, in all cases the degeneracy was lifted in the way it is observed experimentally: the gap between the linear Dirac dispersions became smaller for one of the non-degenerate components and disappeared in several momentum points. In other words, canting resulted in splitting of the 3D-Dirac points (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) into Weyl points and Weyl loops. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> we present the main results for the configuration of spins with the ferromagnetic component along &#x00393;M direction (&#x00393;M<sub>II</sub>). Two sets of Weyl points are observed in this case. The first one consists of four points with the coordinates (0.193, 0.193, 0.12), (&#x02212;0.193, &#x02212;0.193, 0.12), (0.194, 0.194, &#x02212;0.09), and (&#x02212;0.194, &#x02212;0.194, &#x02212;0.09) with the energy of 168&#x02009;meV above the Fermi level. These points move toward the mentioned earlier 3D-Dirac points upon decreasing of the canting angle and annihilate in the case of perfect antiferromagentism (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Another set of Weyl points with coordinates (0.394, 0.045, 0.131), (0.394, &#x02212;0.045, 0.131), (0.045, 0.394, 0.131), and (&#x02212;0.045, &#x02212;0.394, 0.131) with the energy of 40&#x02009;meV below the Fermi level corresponds to the crossing of the non-degenerate bands observed experimentally in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. In the right panels of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> we show the band dispersions in the vicinity of one of these points. The key observation is that the Weyl &#x0201c;cones&#x0201d; are very anisotropic. If perpendicular to the Fermi surface in <italic>k</italic><sub>x</sub><italic>k</italic><sub>y</sub> plane, the Fermi velocity is a record-breaking one (9&#x02009;eV&#x000c5;), if along the Fermi surface or along <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>, it is more than two orders of magnitude smaller (~0.043&#x02009;eV&#x000c5;). Apart from the mentioned Weyl points we found the loops of Weyl crossings around the &#x00393;M<sub>&#x022a5;</sub> (these are analogous to the Dirac loop shown earlier in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, but doubly degenerate, not quarterly, shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> on the &#x00393;M<sub>&#x022a5;</sub> line) and very small gap regions above the second set of Weyl points close to the ZAR plane. Our band-structure calculations thus clearly point to the first realization of the Weyl state in a canted antiferromagnet (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Taking into account the importance of the <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-dispersion and very small gaps caused by anisotropic Weyl cones implied by the calculations, we have performed both very detailed photon energy dependent measurements and high-resolution measurements near the calculated Weyl points (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It turned out that the mentioned earlier photon energies at which the FS contours were sharp and continuous approximately correspond to <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-locations of either second set of Weyl points or the minimum gaps, naturally explaining the observed effect since the <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-dispersion in these regions is negligible. However, even at <italic>h&#x003bd;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x02009;eV we could not clearly resolve the tiny gaps and in both cases we observed qualitatively similar distribution of spectral weight near the Fermi level, as if the Weyl points existed at both <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>s.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Fermi arcs</title><p id="Par17">As is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, the Weyl points from the first set are projected to the surface BZ (dashed circles) such that they annihilate. The Weyl points from the second set, in contrast, should be connected by peculiar surface states (the Fermi arc), when measuring the 001 surface, as in our experiment. In order to detect the possible fine structure and elusive arc of surface states, we have used lower photon energies to increase momentum resolution. The high-precision Fermi surface map is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. In the lower part of the map we overlay the experimental intensity with guides to eye to explain the observed features. There are clearly more features than one could previously conclude from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and simplified calculations presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. While one can still identify the elements of the calculated FS&#x02014;hole-like lenses and electron-like pockets close to the X-points, they appear connected and in the region of the &#x0201c;lens&#x0201d; one can clearly identify three features instead of two. If the connection between the lenses and electron-like pockets, as was shown earlier, is due to the lifting of the spin-degeneracy, the third feature on the map is the Fermi surface arc which connects two previously detected Weyl points. The data shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref> confirm this assignment. Indeed, there are three Dirac-like dispersions corresponding to each &#x0201c;lens&#x0201d;. These two datasets are taken using different photon energy in an attempt to distinguish the bulk from the surface component. One can notice that in panel b two internal lines are less intense than the external ones, and in panel c the most inner ones are weaker than four others. On the basis of this observation and analysis of many other similar datasets we arrived at the conclusion that it is innermost linear dispersion corresponds to the Weyl arc. This is supported by the data taken from EuMnBi<sub>2</sub>. We present enlarged fragments of panels b and c together with similar cuts taken from different sample in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. The third feature is clearly present in all datasets. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> the high-precision Fermi surface map is zoomed into the single lens. Not only is the arc remarkably absent, but also the shape and intensity distribution of the ARPES intensity helps us to identify the bulk component in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>. The bulk lens has a very strong straight section and corners. Exactly the same characteristics are peculiar to the outer dispersions in the discussed earlier panels (a) and (b) of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

This is expected, since the perpendicular domains seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> are not always equally strong and their contributions to the signal depend on the particular cleaved surface.</p><p id="Par19">We briefly discuss other possible explanations of the unusual behavior seen in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>. We would like to immediately exclude the possible presence of slightly disoriented crystallites. First, the single crystals are of exceptional quality and at no stage during their characterization have we noticed the presence of such crystallites. Second, in this case one would observe doubling of all the features and we see only three. We also believe that the combined influence of finite <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-resolution and <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-dispersion cannot be responsible for the observed effect (the <italic>z</italic>-axis is perpendicular to the surface). The width of the linear dispersing features is resolution limited for all used photon energies (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-dispersion related artifacts are usually much broader and not that clearly separated. In addition, the <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>-dispersion is very similar in Eu-containing material (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and there we do not see any evidence for additional features. Finally, we rule out the &#x0201c;technical&#x0201d; influence of the surface, such as relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, since, again, EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> cleaves in a similar way and there one would expect more surface-related problems because of much larger magnetic moments. We stress here that the decisive experimental fact, which speaks in favor of our interpretation, is the number of features at the Fermi level: any kind of artifact, including the relaxed surface, would produce a replica of the &#x0201c;lens&#x0201d; and thus double the number of crossings. We observe a &#x0201c;lens&#x0201d; and an arc, and the dispersion corresponding to the flat part of the former is a single feature at all photon energies (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). Previous ARPES study on closely related materials SrMnBi<sub>2</sub> and CaMnBi<sub>2</sub> isostructural to EuMnBi<sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>, respectively, did not reveal any surface states, but strongly anisotropic Dirac dispersions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">The connectivity and dispersion of the Fermi arc surface states depends sensitively on the surface orientation and termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The decisive supporting evidence for the existence of the arcs in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> comes from the FPLO calculations. The results of these calculations taking into account spin&#x02013;orbit coupling and antiferromagnetism of Mn atoms are fully consistent with previously discussed LMTO calculations with slightly different energy positions of the Mn-band and Dirac points (compare Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> with Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>).

Again, the lenses and electron-like pockets close to the X-points are well separated at all <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub>&#x02019;s highlighting the necessity of more sophisticated theoretical treatment to match ARPES data. Upon introducing the same canting angle of 10&#x000b0;, degeneracy is lifted and three symmetry inequivalent pairs of Weyl points appear (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Unlike in the case of LMTO calculations, no small loops are present and a pair of very closely separated Weyl points (#3 and #4) is detected instead. The other two pairs are qualitatively the same. Importantly, the most separated in the <bold>k</bold>-space Weyl points (#5 and #6) are of the type II (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>) and connect the non-degenerate lenses with electron pockets, exactly as in the experiment, although the calculated lenses are noticeably smaller (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The Weyl points #1 and #2 are situated above each other and thus are not expected to contribute to the surface states on the measured 001 surface.

This unique electronic structure is shown in three-dimensional space in the lowest panel of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and it is characterized by the 8-times-degenerate electronic states at X-point. It is remarkable that it is in the proximity of this point the degeneracy will be lifted completely in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub>. In the next column of panels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) we show the case of Eu material with SOC and perfect AFM included. This example shows why Weyl state cannot be realized in EuMnBi<sub>2</sub>: spin&#x02013;orbit and exchange interactions open the energy gaps at all Dirac points. Here it is also easy to see the mechanism of the formation of the lenses: the gap is not constant and is not centered at the Fermi level. Next set of panels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>) represents the case of YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> as it is seen from ARPES. The value of <italic>k</italic><sub>z</sub> corresponds to the plane containing Weyl points and the constant gap centered at the Fermi level is considered for simplicity. As mentioned earlier, the degeneracy is seen to be lifted leading to formation of four pairs of Weyl points. Note that the cut &#x00393;X&#x0201d;runs through the Weyl point. If the gap would be centered at the Fermi level along the diamond-like contour (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> would have been a canonical Weyl semimetal of type I. Presence of lenses and electron pockets near X-points which touch in a single point make it the Weyl semimetal of type II.

Due to extremely difficult ARPES experiments (low photoemission signal) and very high resolution needed to resolve the arcs, the use of spin-resolved modification of the technique is nearly blocked, meaning that direct observation of the chirality of the Weyl points is probably postponed until the further improvement of resolution of spin-resolved ARPES. However, the presence of the time-reversal symmetry breaking as seen by magnetization and magneto-optical microscopy, the existence of a continuous Fermi surface, a two-fold degenerate crossings at the Fermi level, and Fermi arc surface states that connect these crossings across the surface BZ are direct evidence of a TRS breaking induced Weyl state in YbMnBi<sub>2</sub> strongly supported by the band-structure and semi-infinite-slab calculations of the canted antiferromagnetic state; future work would be helpful in elucidating the exact mechanism of creating this state in this material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experiments</title><p id="Par25">High-quality single crystals were grown using a Bi rich melt in the ratios YbMnBi10 and EuMnBi10.
