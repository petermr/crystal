<p id="Par34">Ten of the top 48 topological attributes are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a,b)</xref>. Average values per atom of the frequency of occurrence of each attribute at each simulation temperature are given for all attributes except V
 <sub>
  <italic>K</italic>
 </sub> and V
 <sub>
  <italic>Na</italic>
 </sub>. For the latter two, a sum of all cell volumes of type K or Na is divided by the average volume of the full system. Colored points depict configurations belonging to the three EM clusters: liquid (red), crystalline solid (blue), amorphous solid (grey). Attributes in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref> displayed higher values for the crystalline structures below 200 K, while attributes in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> favored the amorphous solid below 200 K. Note that f5, f7, Z and Ze in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> have their highest and almost constant value for temperatures below 140 K and decrease at higher temperatures. This observation, plus the visible inflection point of the enthalpy and volume at that temperature, suggested that the supercooled liquid had transitioned to a solid amorphous state below approximately 140 K. The V
 <sub>
  <italic>K</italic>
 </sub> and V
 <sub>
  <italic>Na</italic>
 </sub> illustrate the volume split assigned by the tessellation to the K and Na atoms, respectively. Clearly shown is a Na volume contraction in the amorphous solid with respect to the crystalline solid, while the opposite effect is visible in the K volume.
