<p>In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the theory developed by Alshits and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] is taken to the next level by including not only the full velocity dependence of 
 <italic>B</italic>, but also longitudinal phonons (in addition to the dominating contribution of transverse phonons) as well as an anisotropic dislocation field and single crystal elastic constants. Hence, this model developed having polycrystals in mind, keeps the phonon spectrum isotropic (for simplicity), but dislocations are modeled according to the single crystal symmetry (bcc, fcc, hcp, etc.) in order to take into account their anisotropy to some extent. This “semi-isotropic” approach constitutes an intermediate step in an ongoing long-term endeavor to include all anisotropic effects and the true phonon spectrum (which is beyond the scope of the current work). Nonetheless, valuable insights were already gained, e.g., the non-trivial dependence of the drag coefficient on the dislocation character angle
