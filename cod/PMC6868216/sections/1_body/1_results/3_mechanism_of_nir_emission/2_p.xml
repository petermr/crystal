<p id="Par13">It is well-known that the free Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions possess a large energy gap (4.2 eV) between the 5
 <italic>d</italic> excited state and the 4 
 <italic>f</italic> ground state
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. Once Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> are introduced into a given compound, the resulting emission wavelengths are affected by centroid shift, crystal splitting, and Stokes shift effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. For K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor, the centroid shift and Stokes shift have weak effect on the redshift because of the low covalence between Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> and O
 <sup>2−</sup> ions and the highly symmetric LuO
 <sub>6</sub> and K2O
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedrons, respectively
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. The CFS depends especially on the coordination numbers, distortion index and size of the polyhedrons
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. The substitution of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in LuO
 <sub>6</sub> and K2O
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedrons, and thus a design principle of selective occupation of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> at small coordination numbers takes effect. It results in large CFS, which in turn leads to a large redshift. A comparison of the local environment of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> and Rb
 <sub>3</sub>YSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> benefits further understanding of the abnormal NIR emission in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>. Firstly, they are isomorphic, and Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions occupy the same crystallographic lattices in both materials, and the distortion index of YO
 <sub>6</sub>/LuO
 <sub>6</sub> and K2O
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedron are all 0
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the effect of polyhedral distortion on the NIR emission can be neglected. Secondly, the 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>av</sub> values of Lu-O and K2-O in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> are 2.22 Å and 2.77 Å, respectively, which are much smaller than that of Y-O and K2-O (2.29 Å and 2.86 Å) in Rb
 <sub>3</sub>YSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, resulting in a larger CFS in 5d energy levels and a larger redshift
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, the NIR light emission (740 nm) in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is reasonable compared with the red emission (622 nm) in Rb
 <sub>3</sub>YSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. In summary, the selective occupation of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in polyhedrons with small coordination numbers and small average bond length contribute to the NIR emission and the broad excitation band in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>.
