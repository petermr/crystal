<p>The five antennas are distributed in two rows with three receiving antennas in the upper row, and one transmitting antenna and one receiving antenna in the other row. The gain of the five cone-shaped horn antennas is 25 dB. Rx1 and Rx2 form the vertical interferometric baseline, and the baseline length is 2.1 cm. Rx2 and Rx3 or Rx2 and Rx4 form the horizontal interferometric baseline, and the baseline length is 2.1 cm and 4.2 cm, respectively. In the InISAR imaging experiments, Rx4 is neglected. This array configuration can be flexible changed by connecting external waveguide. The photograph of the front-end setup is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Besides InISAR imaging, this system also has many other potential applications such as InSAR imaging, ViSAR imaging, and micro-motion target 3-D imaging.
