 <caption> Perspective views of MC/MD evolved structures and the corresponding change in enthalpy: ( a, b) are evolved after 15 and 50 atomic MC swaps, respectively. (c) shows gradual change of potential energy from the initial structure to 50 MC swap evolved structure. Ta, Nb, Hf and Zr atoms are depicted with green, blue, orange and maroon colours, respectively. </caption>
