 <italic>Olivier Colliez</italic>, 
 <italic>Savinien de Pizzol</italic>, 
 <italic>Cédric Dounval</italic>, 
 <italic>Romain Grouselle</italic> from France for designing a soundscraper that takes advantage of city noise pollution by capturing airborne sound and converting it into usable electric energy. The Sound-scraper would be constructed next to main transport infrastructures, motorways and railroads junctions mostly inside city centers where noise pollution is at its maximum. The skyscraper’s skin consists of electro active lashes supported by a light metallic structure that form the exterior of the building [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The lashes are covered with sound sensors P.F.I.G (Parametric Frequency Increased Generators) which are made of piezoelectric material. These specialized PFIG energy harvester convert sounds vibrations caused by surrounding noises to capture mechanical kinetic energy, after which an array of piezoelectric transducer "cells" employing a novel actuation method are used to convert the mechanical energy into electricity. The electrical current is then transferred to a main storage to be stored or distributed to the grid for regular electric use through the city [
