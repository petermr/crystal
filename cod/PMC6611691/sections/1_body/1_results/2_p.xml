<p>To gain more insight into the nature of the electronic state below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>, we have investigated the angle-dependent MR (ADMR) in LMO for different current (
 <italic>I</italic>) and magnetic field (
 <italic>B</italic>) configurations (details of the resistivity measurements can be found in Materials and Methods). The angles of orientation of 
 <italic>B</italic> within the three principal planes colored in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> are specified by θ, α, and β throughout the manuscript. 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the temperature evolution of the angular dependence of the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis MR (i.e., 
 <italic>I</italic>//
 <italic>a</italic>) as a constant field of 13 T is rotated within the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane. Above 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> ~ 25 K, the MR has minima and maxima whenever the field is oriented along 
 <italic>a</italic> or 
 <italic>c</italic>, respectively. As shown in the left-hand panel of 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, upon reflecting the MR trace about 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>c</italic>, the two traces are perfectly superimposed, implying a fully symmetric response. With decreasing temperature however, the positions of the maxima (and, to a lesser extent, the minima) begin to shift away from the crystallographic axes. The developing asymmetry is most illustrated in the reflection plot, shown in the right-hand panel of 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> for 
 <italic>T</italic> = 4.2 K. (Corresponding reflection plots for a number of intermediate temperatures are displayed in fig. S1.)
