<p>The photoresponse of prepared samples was analyzed by UV-Vis DRS and compared with commercial P25. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f008">Figure 8</xref>a. The curves of all the samples have a similar shape, indicating that iron did not significantly change TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. The difference of the curves lies in the difference of the downward trend and amplitude at 350 to 600 nm. The intersection of the tangent with transverse coordinates at the most obvious downward trend of the curve represents the limit of light absorption. All samples had strong light absorption below 400 nm, but P25 and pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> had almost no absorption at 400 to 800 nm. On the contrary, Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> shows different degrees of absorption to visible light, and the maximum optical absorption wavelength increases with the increase of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> content. This is probably due to the fact that Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> precipitates uniformly in TiO
 <sub>2</sub> during precipitation synthesis, and after calcination at high temperature, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> enters into the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> lattice and uniformly replaces part of Ti
 <sup>4+</sup>, resulting in the absorption of visible light. The calculation of the band gap energy of samples by the Kubelka–Munk formula is as follows:

 </disp-formula> where A is the absorbance, R is the reflectivity, E is the band gap energy and λ is the optical wavelength. The band gap energy diagram of the sample is obtained by using (F(R)*E)
 <sup>1/2</sup> as the longitudinal coordinate and E as the transverse coordinate, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f008">Figure 8</xref>b. The linear part of the spectrum is extended and the intersection point with the transverse coordinate is the band gap energy of the sample. The band gap energies of P25 and pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> are 3.12 eV and 3.06 eV, respectively. With the increase of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> content from 0.5% to 5.0%, the band gap energy decreases from 2.86 eV to 2.26 eV. The main reason for this is that the iron doping into the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> lattice produces a new impurity energy level, which changes the electronic structure, leading to the decrease of the band gap energy and the absorption of visible light [
