<p>The crystalline structure of the powders was characterized by X-ray diffraction; the patterns obtained are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f011">Figure 11</xref>. The powders annealed at 600 °C under argon and at oxygen partial pressures 10
 <sup>−4</sup> bar exhibit a low degree of crystallization and their XRD patterns can be indexed in the Pm-3m cubic space group. Powders annealed at a p(O
 <sub>2</sub>) higher than 10
 <sup>−3</sup> bar crystallized with the monoclinic structure. This set of data indicates that at a fixed annealing temperature, the annealing atmosphere greatly influences the crystal structure of the synthesized particles.
