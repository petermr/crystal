<p>Starting from the first reports on the perovskite materials dated back to 1839 for the discovery of CaTiO
 <sub>3</sub> mineral by Gustav Rose, the field was mostly devoted to the oxides with the same crystal symmetry until the investigation of cesium halides doped with Pb atoms which started in 1970s [
