 <caption> The distribution of reciprocal-lattice points (red) for samples with fibre-textured crystallites, ( a) with the z axis as the rotation axis, ( b) for samples with fibre texture combined with a partial in-plane texture, and ( c) for azimuthally oriented crystallites. Blue arrows are selected reciprocal-lattice vectors. ( d) Two cuts through reciprocal space by two GIXD measurements taken at different sample azimuths. </caption>
