<p>Photoalignment technology offers precise control at the nanoscale for the planar alignment of LCs and LC polymers.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> The anchoring energy is a force applied from the alignment layer that holds the LC molecule in the desired position, in the absence of external stimuli. Photoalignment offers a large anchoring energy (≈10
 <sup>–3</sup> J m
 <sup>−2</sup>) with a high in‐plane, easy axis control providing a small pre‐tilt angle (&lt;0.2°). This method also offers high spatial alignment resolution,[qv: 35c,36] and facilitates QR alignment in LC polymers.[qv: 35b] Most often, a sulfonic azo‐dye tetrasodium‐5,5′‐((1E,1′E)‐(2,2′‐disulfonato‐[1,1′‐biphenyl]‐4,4′‐diyl)bis(diazene‐2,1‐diyl))bis(2‐hydroxy‐benzoate) (SD1 dye) has been used as the photoalignment layer.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> When the SD1 layer is irradiated by polarized light with a wavelength of 450 nm, the azo‐dye molecules that have their transition dipole moments parallel to the electric field (E‐) vector of the impinging light receive excess energy. This results in their reorientation from the initial position to a direction orthogonal to the E‐vector of the irradiating light which defines the alignment direction (i.e., the easy axis) perpendicular to the E‐vector of the irradiating light, with almost zero tilt angle and a high anchoring energy.
