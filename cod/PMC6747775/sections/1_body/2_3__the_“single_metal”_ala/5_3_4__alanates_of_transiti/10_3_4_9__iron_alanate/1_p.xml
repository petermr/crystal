<p>Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> can be an interesting material for hydrogen storage, due to the 6.84 wt.% of hydrogen content. However, contradictory reports on the decomposition temperature are published. In favor of the near-room temperature stability of Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is the report of Neumaier et al. [
 <xref rid="B249-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> was prepared by means of metathesis of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> + 3LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> in ether at low temperature (−116 °C) [
 <xref rid="B249-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Once formed, the iron easily decomposed. Neumaier et al. presented a 
 <italic>p</italic>-T diagram of the decomposition reaction; around 20 °C a continuous partial decomposition was observed. Meanwhile, a fast decomposition was observed at 90–100 °C. Two comments can be mentioned: (1) The quantity of released hydrogen was not reported despite a detailed thermolysis study being presented. (2) The fast decomposition at 90–100 °C is near to the temperature of α-, and α’-alane decomposition [
 <xref rid="B186-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>], which is one by-product of iron alanate formation. This leave doubts about who is decomposing Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> or AlH
 <sub>3</sub>. Despite that, Neumaier et al. considered Fe(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> to be stable at room temperature. The proposed reactions of formation and decomposition are [
