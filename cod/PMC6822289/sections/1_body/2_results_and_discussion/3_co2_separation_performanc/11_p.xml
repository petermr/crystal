<p>It is interesting to compare our results with the original articles, which report the synthesis details for these COFs. For example, it is important to confirm that the experimental structure can be desolvated. This is the case for 18041N3

 </sup> but not for 13180N3,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
 </sup> where the COF is reported to lose its crystallinity and porosity after solvent removal. Therefore, to use this material for gas adsorption, the fact that our optimization routine converges to a stable structure suggests that this material can be stable without a solvent; this indicates that it would be worthwhile to investigate different synthesis protocols that may allow for milder conditions for the activation and possibly retain the crystallinity of the sample.
