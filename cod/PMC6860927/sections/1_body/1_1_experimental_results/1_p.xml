<p>Pellets of commercially pure Al (&gt; 99.99%) were used to form bi-crystals via the Bridgman technique. The crystals were sectioned using a diamond wire saw into rectangular blocks that were 3 mm long, 1 mm wide and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thick. The Σ3(70.53°) [110](1-1-1) grain boundary was placed end on when looking at the 3x1 mm face, and 45° away from the longest axis of the block. One 3 x 1 mm face was mechanically polished for a few tens of microns using 1200 and then 4000 grit SiC paper. The block was then dipped into an aqueous solution of HNO
 <sub>3</sub>, HCl and HF to optically reveal the GB. Further detail to the experimental procedures can be found in the literature [
