<p>To elucidate this behaviour, we used DFT calculations to determine the energy of each phase as a function of volume for 
 <bold>MnGF</bold>, 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CdGF</bold>. In agreement with the experimental data, our results show that in 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CoGF</bold>, the orthorhombic phase is the most stable at zero pressure, while the rhombohedral phase, with smaller volume, is favoured at higher pressures (

 <italic>a</italic>,
 <italic>b</italic>). The predicted transition pressures are 0.99 GPa (
 <bold>MnGF</bold>) and 0.65 GPa (
 <bold>CoGF</bold>). It is not surprising that these values are both smaller than those observed experimentally: this first-order phase transition involves substantial rearrangement of the guanidinium ions, and the pressure at which the two phases nominally have the same enthalpy should thus be considered a lower bound rather than a quantitative prediction of the phase transition pressure. Indeed, one might expect that in the larger Mn cell this rearrangement should be slightly easier than in the smaller Co analogue, rationalizing the observations that both (1) the difference between the nominal DFT and experimentally observed phase transition pressures and (2) the pressure range where the phases coexist are smaller for 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> than for 
 <bold>CoGF</bold>. In particular, we suggest that such kinetic effects may explain why the phase transition is experimentally observed at a higher pressure for 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> than for 
 <bold>MnGF</bold>, while the DFT model predicts the reverse. Alternatively, of course, this discrepancy may simply reflect limitations of the modelling approach.
