<p>As can be observed, the relative intensity between peaks of the same phase is not accurate. This might be due to the presence of a preferred crystallographic orientation (which is unexpected in powder samples) or because the considered structural model for the calculation is not fully strict with the reality. Nevertheless, as the scale factor, peak shape, and unit cell parameters are correctly adjusted, the results are rigorous with the purity of each sample. The average crystallite size, determined by the Scherrer formula, is 13.46 nm, confirming thus the nanometric structure of the material. A resume of the obtained compositions is presented in
