<p>For the two-dimensional COFs, we observe in most of the cases a shift in the layers (i.e., the “inclined” configuration) that maximizes the noncovalent interactions. This results in a general reduction of the largest free sphere, as shown in

 </xref>. We observe that the energy stabilization due to this shift is very low. Considering the 133 layered structures where the geometry converged at the first cell optimization stage, the energy stabilization at the end of the final cell optimization, i.e., due to the tilting, is on average −13.1 meV/atom. This is a relatively low energy, and one may therefore expect that, at finite temperature, there is no unique stacking of these materials. While our protocol successfully identifies a close-by local minimum for both 2D and 3D structures, for 2D materials, a complete screening of all possible stacking configurations and the averaging over those accessible at finite temperature need to be further explored.
