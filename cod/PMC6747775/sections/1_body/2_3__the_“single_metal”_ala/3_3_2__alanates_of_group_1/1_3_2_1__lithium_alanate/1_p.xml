<p>The LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> has the highest hydrogen content of all alanates, 10.6 wt.%; this is due to the lightness of Li atoms. LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> are the only commercially available alanates; their cost, of course, is not low enough for massive applications. Both of them are currently produced while using direct synthesis in an organic solvent. Mechanochemical production of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> by the milling of LiH and Al under hydrogen atmosphere has given minimal results [
