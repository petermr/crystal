<p id="p0185">The Ag
 <sub>30</sub>Li
 <sub>70</sub> sample was prepared as described in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The XRD data were obtained from 10 to 90° (2θ) with a Bragg Brentano configuration for polycrystalline samples with a wavelength of λ = 0.1542 nm which is, in fact, an average of two closely spaced peaks (CuKα1 and CuKα2).
