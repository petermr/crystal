<p>To compute the minimal parasitic energy of a material, we need as input the pure component isotherms and the heats of adsorption for CO
 <sub>2</sub> and N
 <sub>2</sub>. The adsorbing bed is assumed to have a void fraction of 0.3, due to the pelletization and packing of the crystal. The volumetric working capacity measures the amount of CO
 <sub>2</sub> that one cubic meter of bed can evacuate between adsorption and desorption.
