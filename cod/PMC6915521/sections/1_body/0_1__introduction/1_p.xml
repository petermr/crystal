<p>With the development of micro/nano electromechanical systems [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the sizes of components come to a micro/nanoscale, and the molecular forces between the contact bodies play an important role. It is inevitable that there are some defects in the materials, and the defects in the surface or the subsurface will influence friction behaviors. In the work of Qi et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], just 1Å (10
 <sup>−10</sup> m) of surface roughness could affect the coefficients of friction (COFs) of clean, incommensurate Ni interfaces. The surface or the subsurface defects could influence the surface roughness or the molecular forces, while the detailed friction behaviors between nanoscale contact bodies, considering the surface or subsurface defects, are still unknown.
