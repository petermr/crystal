 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> suitable for X-ray structure determination was grown by vapor diffusion of a 1:1 mixture of benzene and diethyl ether into a solution of the cage in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and chloroform. The crystal structure shows cage structures with a Pd

 <sub>4</sub> stoichiometry with one NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> counterion and one molecule of acetonitrile located inside each cage. In addition, a chloride ion is located close to the metal centers outside of the cage. This counterion most likely originates from the solvent, as chloroform can contain considerable amounts of HCl. The additional anions required to balance the charge of the tetracationic Pd
 <sub>2</sub>L
 <sub>4</sub> cage could not be unambiguously located in the difference Fourier map (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref> for details). The structure belongs to the 
 <italic>P</italic>4/
 <italic>n</italic> space group and the unit cell is occupied by a pair of enantiomeric cages in which the Pd–Pd axis of each cage is located at the 4-fold rotation axis. This means that the cage structure is made up with exclusively (
 <italic>R,R</italic>) or (
 <italic>S,S</italic>) enantiomer of the ligand and that the elementary cell is built from the racemic pair of cages.
