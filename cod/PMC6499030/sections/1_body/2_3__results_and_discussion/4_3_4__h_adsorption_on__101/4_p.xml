<p>The calculated DOS displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> –analogous to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> for the stoichiometric surface– shows the presence of a localized state 1.2 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM) for AE–LCAO with HSE (and 1.4 eV for AE–LCAO with B3LYP and PP–PW with PBE+U). This new peak in the band gap, mainly formed by Ti 3
 <italic>d</italic> states coming from the CBM, is the signature of the reduction of one Ti
 <sup>4+</sup> ion of the surface layer to Ti
 <sup>3+</sup>. This behavior has been observed in UV absorption spectra and documented in previous calculations of the K atom adsorbed on TiO
 <sub>2</sub> surface, where the donation of the electron to TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was localized in a similar state (Muscat et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). It is remarkable that, in spite of the different position of the valence band maximum, PBE+U predicts a position of that peak with respect to the CBM in agreement with hybrid functionals. In previous infrared spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculation based on GGA+U on rutile reduced by hydrogen, these gap states have been reported to be in the range 0.75-1.18 eV below the CBM (Cronemeyer, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Finazzi et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Islam et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Antila et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which is consistent with the data presented here. Therefore, both the AE–LCAO and PP–PW implementations predict a similar position of the band gap state due to the localization of the extra electron on the 3d orbital of a Ti
