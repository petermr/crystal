<p>An elevated presence of bromine atoms was detected within the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasitized cells. No bromine signal above background level (set by the concentration of Br atoms in the bovine serum) was detected either within the cytosol compartment of the red blood cell or at its membrane. This observation suggests that once the quinoline molecule reaches the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite, having penetrated the red blood cell, it stays therein. Importantly, BrQ accumulates in the digestive vacuole, reaching concentrations as high as 150 Î¼M, that is, thousandfold higher than the concentration introduced into the culture medium. It is by virtue of the fact that the digestive vacuole is an acidic organelle with pH in the range of 4.5 to 4.9 (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) that BrQ, being a weak base, accumulates therein at high concentrations, as has been earlier suggested for chloroquine (
