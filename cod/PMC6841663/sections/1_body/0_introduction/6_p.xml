<p id="Par7">The ML-LSA proposed in this work was applied to our own MD simulations of LCPs using the SCGB (soft-core Gay-Berne) model similar to what Skačej and Zannoni developed for their Monte-Carlo simulations

 </sup>. To construct a ML model which classifies “smectic-like” and “nematic-like” structures of LCPs, we first obtained small and thus computationally less demanding monodomain LCP trajectories. Next, to simulate the microscopic structure change induced by temperature variations, LCP trajectories for a larger system were quenched from the temperature condition for the isotropic structure to that for the smectic-like structure. The quenched trajectories generally have complex local structures that contain nematic- and smectic-like mesogenic structures; however, conventional particle-based analysis cannot distinguish between the two. Using ML-LSA, we successfully classified these complex local structures, regardless of the choice of user-dependent parameters, i.e., the aspect ratio of mesogenic rigid ellipsoids. Furthermore, the results provided by ML-LSA suggest the best order parameter for distinguishing between nematic- and smectic-like mesogenic structures. Our ML model enables automatic and systematic analysis of the mesogenic structures without prior knowledge, and thus can overcome the difficulty of manually determining the specific order parameter required for the classification of complex structures.
