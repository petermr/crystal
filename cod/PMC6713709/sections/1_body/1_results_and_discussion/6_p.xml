 <sup>st</sup>, 20
 <sup>th</sup>, 100
 <sup>th</sup>, 200
 <sup>th</sup>, and 300
 <sup>th</sup> repetition. Immediately after sweeping the voltage to 4.5 V and 2.8 V, we had to wait for the Li extraction and insertion to finish after over 30 repetitions of the potentiostatic mode for 3 sec and OCV mode for 57 sec before each 
 <italic>operando</italic> photoemission measurement, because the high rate of CV sweeping gave rise to a delayed extraction and insertion of Li. The small change of the voltage in the OCV curve (e.g., from 4.5 V to approx. 4.2 V) ensured the oxidation of LCO. After the 300
 <sup>th</sup> repetition for the 4.5 V condition, the potential was swept down to 2.8 V to monitor the Li insertion reaction and reduction of the LCO particles. A reduction peak was not observed due to the small amount of LCO particles. Nevertheless, the OCV curves after the potentiostatic mode at 2.8 V for 3 sec indicated an almost constant potential at around 3 V up to the 20
 <sup>th</sup> repetition, which confirmed the reduction reaction of LCO by Li insertion. After the 100
 <sup>th</sup> repetition, the potential decreased down to approximately 2.6 V, which was the initial OCV before sweeping the voltage to 4.5 V, possibly because the repetition of many times returned the cell potential to the initial condition.
