<p id="Par5">To facilitate our discussion, we first classify the 32 crystallographic point groups into pseudo-polar and non-pseudo-polar point groups (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), where a pseudo-vector (such as spin, magnetization, angular moment, magnetic field) is allowed or forbidden, respectively. This classification is in the same spirit as the classification of the point groups into polar and non-polar point groups. As we will show below, it will be very useful for checking the existence of bulk and local spin polarizations. We note that spin vectors
