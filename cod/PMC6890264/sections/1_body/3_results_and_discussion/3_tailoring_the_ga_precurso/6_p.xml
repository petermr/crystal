<p>In the present case, however, the structural differences between the possible products and the template NCs are less pronounced because low-chalcocite Cu

 </xref>a,b). However, we observe that, in all three dimensions, the wurtzite CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub> structure exhibits a significant lattice contraction compared to that of low-chalcocite Cu

 </sub>S (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>c,d). These contractions are 5.6, 5.7, and 9.5% in 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>, respectively. On the other hand, the anion positions of wurtzite CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub> and α′-Ga
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub> are very similar: transforming the former into the latter, the lattice has to contract by only 0.6, 0.5, and 2.5% in 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>, respectively (the definition of

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>). It is thus clear that, based on the bulk crystal structure parameters, the sulfide sublattice of the template low-chalcocite Cu
 <sub>2–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>S would have to undergo similar degrees of reconstruction, regardless of whether the cation exchange would be partial, yielding wurtzite CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub>, or complete, yielding α′-Ga
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub>. However, we note that the product wurtzite CGS NCs (with Cu/Ga ratios ranging from 1:1.48 to 1:0.62) obtained in our work exhibit a larger lattice constant than the wurtzite CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub> reference (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>h,i), indicating that the degree of contraction was smaller than expected based on the bulk lattice parameters, and therefore, that the product CGS NCs are under tensile strain. This suggests that the mild reaction conditions used in our work do not allow the anion sublattice to undergo full reconstruction in order to relax the strain induced by the CE.
