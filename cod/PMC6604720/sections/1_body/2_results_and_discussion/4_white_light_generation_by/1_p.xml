<p>Red-emitting Y(OH)

 <sup>3+</sup> sub-micrometer phosphors were integrated into a YAG-based white LED configuration, and the resulting optical features were investigated. Among the varying doping ratios, Y(OH)

 <sup>3+</sup> fabricated at 60 min was selected as a model material since the results from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> indicated that this sample had the highest emission intensity. The optical properties (CRI, CCT, luminous efficiency (LER), and lumen) of the PDMS composites are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> shows the CRI and CCT of the PDMS composites as a function of the amount of red phosphor. While the CRI remains almost unchanged at around 60, the CCT decreases from 3900 to 3600 K. The main reason for the unfavorable CRI for this system may be the lack of blue color. On the other hand, a significant improvement from 281 to 348 lm/W (nearly a 24% increase) is observed for the luminous efficiency when the red phosphor is employed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Meanwhile, the measurement of lumens remains almost the same, showing no significant change as the red phosphor amount increases. According to the color coordinates as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, all PDMS composites seem to be accumulated in the yellow region of the spectrum. They are far from the ideal white light and require more blue color to shift the resulting color spectrum towards white. Therefore, integration of Y(OH)

 <sup>3+</sup> into the PDMS/YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> composite is just part of the process towards obtaining high quality white light generation. It is possible to obtain the primary colors, green, and blue by using the method proposed in this study by adjusting the lanthanide chemistry. In such a case, by combining all the primary colors, one can successfully generate high-quality white light with a high CRI and low CCT. Moreover, the efficiency of these systems can be improved even more by optimizing the long-term stability of PDMS under UV irradiation since it can undergo degradation due to the breakage of bonds in organic molecules, resulting in the loss of transparency and coloration (i.e., yellowing). For instance, it was observed that residues of PDMS can show a yellowish appearance and also embrittlement and cracking upon UV exposure may occur [
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, a proper selection of the matrix material while preparing the phosphor-based color conversion layers is a way to significantly improve the efficiency of the generated white light.
