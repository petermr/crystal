 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 sample, further deviation of ∠NOR from 180° compared to that of 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 enables an antiferromagnetic interaction between Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Re
 <sup>5+</sup> ions. In an ordered structure, this will result the moment of the individual sublattice to order along the same direction. Strong spin-orbit interaction may result magneto-crystalline anisotropy in case of the Re 5
 <italic>d</italic> spins, while the Ni spins, residing in more isotropic 3
 <italic>d</italic> orbitals, will orient antiparallel to Re spins following the super-exchange interaction. Therefore, the final magnetic structure is resulted in an ferrimagnetic arrangement between the two sublattices along the crystallographic 
 <italic>b</italic>-axis. In LSCNRO, both Ni
 <sup>2+ </sup>and Re
 <sup>5+ </sup>ions have two unpaired electrons. However, the strong spin-orbit coupling in 5
 <italic>d</italic> orbitals (relative to 3
 <italic>d</italic> orbitals) usually results in a reduced total moment in Re ions compared to its spin only value
