 <caption> The phenomena and mechanisms of Dresselhaus/Rashba spin splitting and BSVSP. a Schematic depiction of Dresselhaus/Rashba spin splitting and BSVSP. “1” and “2” means single and double degenerate, respectively. In the Dresselhaus/Rashba spin splitting case, a non-degenerate band (without considering spin) splits into two bands with opposite nonzero spin polarizations. In the case of BSVSP, a double degenerate band (without considering spin) splits, resulting in some non-degenerate bands without net spin polarizations (see Supplementary Note  1 for more discussions). b Schematic illustration of the difference between Dresselhaus/Rashba spin splitting and BSVSP. In the case of Dresselhaus/Rashba spin splitting, a k-dependent magnetic field induces the band splitting. In BSVSP–I (II), the magnetic fields acting on two different p orbitals of the same atom (acting on different atoms of the same kind) are equal in strength but opposite, resulting in a band splitting with vanishing spin polarization </caption>
