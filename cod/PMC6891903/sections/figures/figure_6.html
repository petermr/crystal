 <caption> Performance of the wind speed sensor. a) I–V characteristics of the wind speed sensor under tunable wind speed. b) Current dependence of the wind speed changes and the corresponding linear fitting curves. c) Changes of current upon repeated wind‐driven TIEL (14 m s −1) with different bias voltages. d) Photocurrent increase and e) decrease of the wind speed sensor measured with a bias of 2 V at a wind speed of 14 m s −1. f) Real‐time wind speed curves detected by a commercial wind speed sensor and a fabricated wind sensor system. </caption>
