<p id="Par16">The propulsion of cholesteric droplets doped with either CB15 or Me-
 <bold>m</bold> offers complementary data that point at a threshold value of 
 <italic>N</italic> over which helical motion occurs. The helical twisting power of Ph-
 <bold>m</bold> is larger than that of Me-
 <bold>m</bold> in the same liquid crystal, and was used as a dopant to form droplets of initial pitch ca. 1.6 μm (
 <italic>N</italic> = 25, 0.68 ± 0.01 wt % of Ph-
 <bold>m</bold>). These chiral droplets doped by Ph-
 <bold>m</bold> are characterized by a confinement ratio that is similar to that of the CB15-doped drops, and, similarly, over time, the chiral confinement increases in these droplets, until the high concentration of motor disrupts the liquid crystal order and the droplet turns isotropic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, right panel). The time evolution of the parameter 
 <italic>N</italic> for droplets containing each of these three different dopants (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) points to a threshold value of 
 <italic>N</italic> above which the chirality of the system is sufficient to impart angular velocity to the droplet and consequently drives the motion along helical paths (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). This threshold value was estimated by comparing propulsion of droplets of CB15 and Me-
 <bold>m</bold> and was consistently found in the range 12 &lt; 
 <italic>N</italic> 
 <italic>&lt;</italic> 14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>). We note that CB15-doped droplets swim straight below the threshold 
 <italic>N</italic>, whereas Me-
 <bold>m</bold> doped droplets swim more erratically below that threshold. The difference likely originates in the distortion of the director field caused upon droplet injection in the larger Me-
 <bold>m</bold> droplets (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and the liquid crystalline organization takes longer to emerge in these larger droplets.
