 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> illustrates the four different kinds of PT events that occur at the interface: adlayer-PT (eqn (2)), forward surface-PT (where a water molecule recombines, eqn (1)), backward surface-PT (where a water molecule dissociates, eqn (1)), as well as solvent-assisted PT.
