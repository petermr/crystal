 <italic>c</italic> axis when referring to hexagonal axes) and arranged as in a cubic close packing (ccp).

 </sup> Boron atoms occupy two sites which are distinguished as polar, B
 <sup>p</sup>, and equatorial, B
 <sup>e</sup>. The former are situated on opposite triangles along the threefold direction, whereas equatorial ones form a puckered hexagon ring (i.e., represent the “waist” of icosahedra). The bonding situation of α-B
 <sub>12</sub> is easily rationalized by employing established electron-counting schemes.

 </sup> Between close-packed layers, neighboring icosahedra are connected via terminal (exo) bonds involving two B
 <sup>p</sup> atoms, whereas within-layers icosahedra are linked via 3c2e bonds involving the B
 <sup>e</sup> atoms. The different bonding motifs (B
 <sub>12</sub> skeleton, terminal 2c2e, and intralayer 3c2e) are well reflected in the distribution of involved B–B interatomic distances: those range from 1.75 to 1.81 Å for skeleton bonded atoms within clusters and are 1.67 and 2.01 Å for 2c2e and 3c2e connected atoms, respectively.
