<p>The chemical stability of the (Bi
 <sub>0.97</sub>Ta
 <sub>0.03</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3.06</sub> pigment was also evaluated. The powder sample was dispersed into 4% acetic acid and 4% ammonium bicarbonate aqueous solutions. After leaving them at room temperature for 6 h, the samples were washed with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at room temperature. The color of the samples after the chemical stability test was evaluated using the colorimeter. Unfortunately, slight color degradation was observed after the soaking test, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>, so it is necessary to cover the surface using an inert substance such as silica to suppress the color degradation.
