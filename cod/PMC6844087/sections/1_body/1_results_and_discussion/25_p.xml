<p>In this second design of samples, the obtained coefficients are substantially lower than those obtained in the first design. In contrast with the first batch, now the relative value of 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>12</sub> is much lower than 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>. These results are consistent with the fact that the chemical composition is almost constant in this range. Moreover, the surface represented in 
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>
 </xref>B is almost constant in all of the experimental domain. Even though it may seem that there is some slope, the corresponding small purity should be taken into account. Finally, to check the model results obtained here, an extra sample with intermediate conditions has been prepared and characterized. This sample has been prepared at 900 °C for 60 min, and the corresponding purity obtained by the Rietveld refinement is 95.7% with χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 3.08. This chemical composition is consistent with the predicted values under the same conditions (95.8%), and, hence, the model is validated.
