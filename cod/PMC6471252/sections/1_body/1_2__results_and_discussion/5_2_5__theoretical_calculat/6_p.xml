<p>A Partial Density Of State (PDOS) plot is another way of describing the electronic structure of the crystalline system. In particular, it is a quick way to assess which molecular fragments contribute most to this structure at a certain energy level, and which are therefore the most important in electronic excitation processes. In the case of

 </inline-formula>, the Highest Occupied Crystalline Orbitals (HOCO) form a well-separated band and are dominated by the contribution from the pyrene moiety (
