 </sup>, resulting in a value of ~4.4 eV (for details see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This value is well within the expected scope, as optical band gaps are usually slightly smaller than the band gaps calculated via DFT. The calculated large band gap is in good agreement with the very low thermal quenching (see next chapter). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the total density-of-states (DOS) and atom-resolved partial density-of-states curves (pDOS). The latter gives the contributions of the constituent elements to the total DOS. The valence bands originate from the oxygen and nitrogen 2p-orbitals and are very narrow, which is typical for salt-like ionic compounds. Empty states of strontium and aluminium form the bottom of the conduction band, while the empty states of Li are at slightly higher energies.
