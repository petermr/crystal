 <sub>3</sub> NCs with no noticeable presence of other phases. All main diffraction peaks in the case of Br/Cl-containing NCs were shifted toward larger angles compared to the ICSD-#97851-pattern (orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub>), because of the lattice contraction induced by the smaller radius of the Cl ions, thereby also confirming the formation of the homogeneous solid solution. The TEM image reveals that CsPbBr

 <sub>3</sub> NCs were also characterized by the TRPL. All samples showed biexponential decay lifetimes in solution with intensity averaged lifetime values of 10.5, 4.6, 10.4, 7.7, and 20.7 ns (for 
 <italic>x</italic>-values from 0.39 to 0), from bluest to greenest samples respectively (

Drop-cast films generally exhibited shorter lifetimes of 8.5, 1.95, 2.8, 2.84, and 2.34 ns for the same samples, correspondingly.
