<p>Solution‚Äêprocessed methods that strongly rely on stoichiometric ratios are simple to operate, but take longer time to crystallize. Colloidal synthesis as a mature method has previously been widely used to synthesize inorganic quantum dots (QDs).

 <sub>3</sub> QD colloidal dispersions, which resulted in high luminescence and good dispersion due to the surface ligand capping.
