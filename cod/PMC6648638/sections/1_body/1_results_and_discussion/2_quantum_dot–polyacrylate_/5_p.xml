<p>In general, the PL emission intensity of quantum dots decreases with increasing temperature. Because heating makes the ligands peel off the surface of the quantum dot, resulting in agglomeration of the quantum dots, and thus reducing their luminous intensity. In addition, thermal energy also affects electronic transitions, especially the recombination of electron–holes, which in turn leads to a significant drop in the luminous intensity. This fluorescence heat quenching of quantum dots presents in a silicone package using the conventional thermal curing process.

 </sup> To reduce the above disadvantages of fluorescence heat quenching, we have tried to employ a photopolymerization process. In

 </xref>, the emission intensity of green quantum dots in the B2 polymer matrix after photopolymerization retains about 90% intensity before photopolymerization. Compared with a silicone package using the conventional thermal curing process, this result fully demonstrates that the use of photopolymerization has a major advantage of emission stability over the thermal curing process. It can be explained that the preparation of the QD–polymer hybrid light-emitting film by the photopolymerization method not only has a fast process speed but can also reduce the damage to the materials of quantum dots. Red quantum dots have a similar result to that of green quantum dots.
