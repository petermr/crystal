<p>To investigate the reactivity of 
 <bold>2</bold>, it was reacted with the Lewis acids [M(CO)
 <sub>5</sub>(thf)] (M=Cr, W) at −80 °C in THF. From the reaction with [W(CO)

 <bold>3</bold>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201909423-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) was isolated in 43 % yield. 
 <bold>3</bold> represents the first compound with a planar As
 <sub>2</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub> ring that has been structurally characterized. A related substituted compound [{(C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>)Fe(CO)}{As(CH
 <sub>3</sub>)

 <sub>2</sub>, has only been characterized by spectroscopic methods (
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and IR) and elemental analysis, but not by single crystal X‐ray diffractions.
