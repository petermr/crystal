<p>Considering the different morphology of perovskite nanomaterials, the two main classes can be highlighted: 2D or nanoplatelets and 0D or nanocrystals. The background for 2D perovskites was established in the 1990s and was related to the layered bulk crystals which possess similar properties as free-standing nanoplatelets. In 2015 Tisdale et al. [

 <sub>4</sub> nanoplatelet synthesis with controlled thickness and optical transitions. Synthetic routes for nanocrystals were developed in parallel, and in 2014, a ligand-assisted reprecipitation method to synthesize the perovskite nanocrystals was first reported [

 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] describing a synthetic route of all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with high PLQY. These works burst the interest of the scientific community and entailed the increasing number of published scientific and engineering works.
