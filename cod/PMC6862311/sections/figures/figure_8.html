 <caption> ( a) Temperature dependence of the parameter λ for three LC compounds, obtained from the fits of experimental data with scaling relations of multicritical scaling theory (MCST). The relative temperature Δ T = T − T c is measured from the Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition temperature T C ; ( b) Temperature averaged values of 〈 σ m 〉 T and their fit with the MCST for three compounds. In the inset, an enlarged region for m values from one to seven is shown. (adopted from Zaluzhnyy et al. [ 17]–Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry) Used under CC-BY 3.0. </caption>
