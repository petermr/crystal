<p>In this paper, we present a combined experimental and quantitative study on the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of mechanically isolated 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. Through a systematic characterization including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and azimuth-dependent reflectance difference microscopy (ADRDM), we firstly identified the 1T’-phase WTe
 <sub>2</sub> to have an optical anisotropic crystal structure. Secondly, a 12-electrode-structure was designed for the evaluation the electrical anisotropy of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, and the results demonstrated up to 10
 <sup>3</sup> times relative electrical anisotropy. Subsequently, the photo-electrical conductance was studied to further explore the anisotropic photo-electric property. Our results revealed an anisotropic photo-electrical conductance with a maximum ratio of 4.33 among the 12 directions. Finally, a photodetector with twelve electrodes was used to distinguish the different wavelengths in the visible spectrum, demonstrating that 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> shows promising application as an anisotropic photodetector.
