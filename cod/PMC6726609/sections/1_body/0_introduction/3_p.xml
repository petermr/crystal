<p id="Par4">In addition to the ionic and electronic conductivity and structural stability of the electrode material itself, the electronic transmission rate between electrode material and current collector and the ionic diffusion rate between electrode material and electrolyte also have a great influence on the performance of supercapacitor. The former can be achieved by combining electrode materials with highly conductive materials (such as active carbon, carbon nanotube, graphene, metal foam)

 </sup>, especially nickel foam with three-dimensional (3D) conductive framework, light weight, strong mechanical properties, flexibility, which is often used as a template to prepare an integrated electrode material and as the conductive bridge between current collector and electrode material to improve electronic transmission performance

 </sup>. The latter is usually achieved by using micro-nano fabrication techniques to obtain electrode materials with 3D hierarchical structure, which can improve the liquid-connection area between electrode material and electrolyte and further reduce concentration polarization
