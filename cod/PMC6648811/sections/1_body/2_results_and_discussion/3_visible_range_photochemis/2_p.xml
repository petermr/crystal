 </xref> illustrates the NOA signals recorded for the 451 nm LED photolysis of a PetACrONO-infused PD prepared from NuSil Technology Med-6233 for excitation times of 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 s at 45 mW. The integrated signals provide a quantitative evaluation of the NO released in each case, the average values being 119 ± 9, 193 ± 4, and 272 ± 10 pmol, respectively. Although the longer photolysis times led to larger integrated signals, the increase was not linear. This nonlinearity may reflect the reversibility of the photoreaction in analogy to

In addition, successive experiments, showed a modest decrease in the quantity of NO released, suggesting some depletion of the PetACrONO present in the PDs, which on the average totaled ∼1.7 μmol.
