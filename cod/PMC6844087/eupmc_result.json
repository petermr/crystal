    "Magnetic ferrites are used in a wide range of technological applications, such as biomedicine, electronics, or energy. They also present interesting magnetic properties, especially for high-frequency applications. These materials have been prepared by a large variety of methods, from basic solid-state reaction to advanced wet chemical methods. However, most of these approaches are complex and have low production rates. In this work, a deep analysis of an easy polymer-assisted sol-gel synthesis of copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) nanoparticles is done. A multivariate analysis, by means of the design of experiments approach, is carried out to account for two variables at a time. Moreover, a wide experimental domain is explored, and the impact of each variable on the chemical composition and magnetic properties is determined. This work results in an optimization of the synthesis method to obtain high-purity nanoparticles (∼96%)."
