<p>Apart from the TIEL intensity, the performance of perovskite‐based PD is also critical to the wind speed sensor.

 </xref>a shows that the solution‐processed MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite thin film that was used in the PD as the light‐absorbing material. The fabrication procedure is illustrated in the Experimental Section. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b,c respectively displays the surface and cross‐sectional images taken by SEM. It is shown that the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> layer (300 nm in thickness) on the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> hole blocking layer (25 nm in thickness) is filled with crystalline MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> and covered by a layer of MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles with a diameter of 200 nm. The average surface of roughness is 28 nm, which is determined by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). The XRD pattern is according with those reported in the previous tetragonal perovskite structure (Figure S5b, Supporting Information).

 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, the absorption edge of the MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub>‐TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite film (Curve I) is at 760 nm, which also agrees with previous reports.
 <xref rid="advs1381-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Compared with the compact TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (Curve II), there is a broad range for the absorption of the MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub>‐TiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite film. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, the absorption band of the perovskite material largely overlaps with the emission band of ZnS:Cu, indicating that the PD is able to absorb the TIEL and convert it into electric signals and enable the detection of the wind speed. Lastly, conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) in a contact mode is employed to illustrate the photoresponse property of the perovskite‐based PD. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f shows the current distribution mapping under the illumination of 50 mW cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Clearly, the current through the illuminated sample is considerably higher than that in dark environment. The quantitative analysis in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1381-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>g indicates that the excited sample with a bias voltage of 8 V shows a photocurrent of 813 pA, which is 2.5‐fold higher than it is in a dark environment (325 pA). Therefore, these results suggest that the perovskite‐based PD displays an excellent photoresponse property for rapid detections of various light signals.
