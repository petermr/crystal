<p>TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (I4/mcm, space group No. 140) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. The calculated Ga-Te distance is 2.69 Ã…, and Tl-Tl bond length is smaller than the separation between Te and Tl atoms, which make up the GaTe
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra (

The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the solar cells are highly influenced by the band gap of the photoactive semiconductors. The detailed-balance limiting efficiency of an ideal solar cell is 32% for a material with the optimal band gap of 1.4 eV [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Band gap calculation using electronic band structure provides a promising opportunity to identify suitable PV materials. The band structure and site-projected density of states of dichalcogenide TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> calculated with HSE06 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02667-f001">Figure 1</xref>b,c, respectively. The valence band maximum (VBM) is located at the Z-point and Z1-point. The first conduction band minimum (CBM) is located along M-P directions and the second CBM is located at Z-point. In two different experimental studies, it was reported that the band gap energy of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is 0.84 eV [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and 1.2 eV [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The reason for this deviation is not known. Our calculations show that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> has an indirect band gap of 1.109 eV, which is higher than the mBJ calculation (0.94 eV) [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but has a good agreement with an experimentally verified band gap value of 1.2 eV [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Also, we observe that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits a direct band gap of 1.129 eV at the Z-point and the difference between direct and indirect band gap is 20 meV. This phenomenon is verified further by a study on the optical properties of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> later in this article. The site-projected density of states shows that valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly due to Tl-s state with little contribution of Te-p state, while conduction band maximum (CBM) is mainly contributed by Ga-s state and Tl-d state in
