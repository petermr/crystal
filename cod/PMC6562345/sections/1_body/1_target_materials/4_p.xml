<p>We have studied the behaviour of 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> under pressure, using single-crystal laboratory and synchrotron X-ray and powder neutron diffraction. We found that both 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> and 
 <bold>CoGF</bold> undergo a first-order transition from the ambient orthorhombic phase to a rhombohedral phase isostructural with 
 <bold>CdGF</bold> at moderate pressures, with the two phases in each case coexisting over a small pressure range (
 <bold>MnGF</bold>, 1.2 GPa to 1.5 GPa; 
 <bold>CoGF</bold>, 2.0 GPa to 2.6 GPa). Unlike the related metal ammonium formates in argon pressure-transmitting medium, no indication of the medium entering the framework was observed [
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In single-crystal measurements, the high-pressure phase exists as a non-merohedral twin, with two components corresponding to the two orientations of the guanidinium ions in the ambient-pressure herringbone pattern (see electronic supplementary material). Indeed, parallel twin domains are clearly visible in the high-pressure phase (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Taking layers of the two different guanidinium orientations to represent ‘spin up’ and ‘spin down’, the system is thus analogous to a one-dimensional Ising spin chain: initially antiferromagnetic, applying pressure causes the nearest-neighbour interactions to become ferromagnetic, and hence domains of aligned guanidinium ions grow to macroscopic sizes.
