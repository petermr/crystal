<p>As final remark, it should be point that, in the solution, the water molecules appear uniformly around the ions in the means of time average; however, the ordered arrangement of water molecules around an ion at the interface is more likely pinned. This is because the diffusion of ions and water molecules at the interface is much slower than that in the solution.</p>
