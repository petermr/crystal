 </sup> Powders of crystalline β-boron (99.95%, ChemPur) and silicon (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed with molar ratios Si/B = 1:2 and 1:3 and placed inside hexagonal boron nitride capsules in an Ar-filled glovebox. The total amount of starting materials mixture varied between 65 and 120 mg. To prepare the high-pressure cell assembly, BN sample capsules were positioned in a graphite furnace, which in turn was placed together with a zirconia thermal insulating sleeve (0.57 mm wall thickness, 7.77 mm OD, 10.80 mm length) in a magnesia octahedron with 18 mm edge length. Sample capsules were pressurized at a rate of about 0.5 GPa/h with 25 mm Toshiba grade E tungsten carbide cubes truncated to 12 mm edge length. After reaching the target pressure (either 5.5 or 8 GPa), the samples were heated to a target temperature between 900 and 1200 °C within an hour. The temperature was monitored by a type-C thermocouple (W5%Re–W26%Re) close to the sample. After applying the dwelling time, the samples were quenched by turning off the power to the furnace (quench rate ∼50 °C/min and at approximately constant pressure). Afterward, the pressure was released at a rate of approximately 0.5 GPa/h. The recovered, cylindrically shaped, sample was crushed and coarsely ground. Excess Si was removed by treating the ground samples twice with hot NaOH solution (20%, 6 h with stirring) and then with HCl and aqua regia. This procedure yielded crystalline SiB
