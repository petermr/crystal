<p id="Par34">UV-LED chips with an emission peak wavelength centered at 365 nm were purchased from Shine On Corp. In a typical preparation, a certain amount of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub> powder was mixed with PMMA/toluene solution and coated onto the UV-LED chip. Next, Mn-Doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> QD solution was added into a 1-ml transparent PMMA/toluene solution. After that, the Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution was coated onto the UV-LED chip which was already coated with Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnCl
 <sub>6</sub>. The device was then cured at room temperature for 30 min.
