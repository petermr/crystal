 <caption> SEM image of crystal aggregate of Pnm2 1-aresenic and the relationship between crystal morphology and lattice axis. Comparison of crystal morphology with unit lattice and atomic arrangement. Pnm2 1-arsenic crystals form as bladed crystals, which show parallel growth along the b-axis. Poor growth in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis results in a thin plate shape. Because periodicity is short in the b-axis direction, Pnm2 1-arsenic crystals tends to elongate in this direction, and the crystals assume a bladed shape. </caption>
