<p>Pursuing an analogous method to that used previously to prepare [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe(η

 <bold>L</bold> at −35 °C in 1,2‐dimethoxyethane (DME), which was then warmed to room temperature (RT) and stirred overnight, gave a deep purple reaction mixture. Dark purple crystals of a new product 
 <bold>1</bold> were obtained in good yield (68 %) by layering this reaction mixture with 
 <italic>n</italic>‐hexane and subsequent filtration (Scheme 
 <xref rid="anie201909240-fig-5001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, top). X‐ray analysis confirmed the expected formulation of 
 <bold>1</bold> as [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe
 <bold>L</bold>] (
 <bold>1‐σ</bold>), in which the ligand 
 <bold>L</bold> has displaced naphthalene from the anionic Cp*Fe moiety (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201909240-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The crystal structure reveals that, in contrast to the η
 <sup>4</sup>‐TPP binding mode in [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe(η
 <sup>4</sup>‐TPP)], the phosphinine ligand acts as a σ‐coordinated [P,N] chelate in [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe
 <bold>L</bold>], with the Cp* and 
 <bold>L</bold> ligands coordinating the iron centre in a trigonal‐planar fashion.
