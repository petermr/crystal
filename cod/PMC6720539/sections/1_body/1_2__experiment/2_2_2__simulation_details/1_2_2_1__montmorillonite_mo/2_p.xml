<p>According to the types and contents of the elements of each montmorillonite in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03997-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the isomorphic substitution of montmorillonite was completed and crystal models with different charge were established. In order to reduce the effect of the types of substituted and interlaminar cations on hydration properties, the most abundant elements in tetrahedron and octahedron of montmorillonite were selected as the substitute cations, so Al replaced Si in tetrahedron and Mg replaced Al in octahedron, and the resulting negative charge was balanced by Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> between layers. The homomorphic substitution was carried out according to the following conditions: The substitution position was randomly replaced, and the adjacent atoms could not be substituted at the same time in the octahedron or tetrahedral sheet [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Finally, four crystal models of montmorillonite with charge densities of 0.375, 0.500, 0.563, and 0.688 were established, which are basically consistent with the experimentally measured data and could be used for the simulation analysis in this paper.
