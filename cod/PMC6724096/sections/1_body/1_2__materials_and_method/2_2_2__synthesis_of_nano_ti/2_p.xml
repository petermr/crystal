<p>The complete process was as follows: TiOSO
 <sub>4</sub> at 0.2 mol/L and pH = 1 was prepared as solution A. NH
 <sub>3</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O of 1.0 mol/L was prepared as solution B. Then, solution A and B separately were added to liquid storage tanks 1 and 2, and the solution entered the liquid distributor through the action of the pump; the flow rates were adjusted to be the same by a liquid flowmeter. After that, two stream flows were ejected at high speed from a jet nozzle in the opposite direction, producing an extended radial impinging spray surface, completing the first micromixing. Then, the impinging spray surface entered from the inner surface of the packing; under the action of centrifugal force, the liquid passed through the packing and was cut and dispersed by the high-speed rotating packing many times simultaneously to complete the second micromixing and precipitation reaction. Finally, the precipitates were collected and then separated using a high-speed centrifuge and were washed with deionized water and ethanol anhydrous to neutral pH, and no sulfate ion was detected by Ba
 <sup>2+</sup>. The precipitates were dried to obtain amorphous nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. Then, nano-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was calcined at 400 °C to 800 °C to obtain a crystalline structure. The experimental setup is shown in
