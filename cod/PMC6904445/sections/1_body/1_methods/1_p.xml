 </sup>. Polished STO(001) substrates were previously cleaned before the deposition, in ultrasonic baths to remove dust particles and greases using acetone, isopropanol and bi-deionized water, for 15 min each, respectively. The substrates were then dried using nitrogen flow. GMO thin films were deposited onto STO(001), through RF-magnetron sputtering, working at 13.56 MHz and 80 W RF power. The distance between target and substrate was fixed at 130 mm. The substrate was kept at 800 °C during deposition, and temperature was measured with a 
 <italic>K</italic>-type thermocouple positioned directly behind the substrate. Prior to deposition, the chamber was evacuated to 5 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> mbar by a turbomolecular pump. The deposition rate of GMO was estimated to be around 2 nm/min. During film deposition, the pressure inside the chamber was adjusted to 5 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> mbar, with a gas composition setting a ratio of Ar:O
 <sub>2</sub> of 4:1. After deposition, the films were left to cool naturally to room temperature in a pure oxygen atmosphere of 1 mbar, without any annealing step.
