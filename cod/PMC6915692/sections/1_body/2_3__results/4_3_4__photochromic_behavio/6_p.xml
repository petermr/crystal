<p>The reversibility study shows that the photochromic effect is reversible in a large part; however, the kinetic of the reversibility is low in comparison with the kinetic of the coloring effect obtained versus irradiation time. Indeed, 5 h after irradiation, the reversibility reached only 40%. Hence the full recovery process can be apprehended to be about 15â€“20 h, which is quite long, besides large scale applications. Considering applications for such powder as its use in solar filter for smart windows, it will be shown that the bleaching phenomenon exhibits a complex behavior, with an impact on the bleaching kinetic of variable parameters as the time, the power and the wavelength of irradiation. Furthermore, current research on these materials have just shown that depending on the shaping process from the as-prepared powder samples to thin films: i.e., with or without the use of glass/polymer matrix addition, with the possibility to coat multilayered-systems, etc., the kinetic of the bleaching step is strongly impacted.</p>
