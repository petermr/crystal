 <sup>4+</sup> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %) were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The stoichiometric amounts of raw materials including BaCO
 <sub>3</sub> (analytical reagent, AR; Tianjin Dingshengxin Chemical Industry Co., Ltd), Gd
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.99%; Jining Tianyi New Materials Co., Ltd), Ta
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (99.5%; Aladdin Chemical Reagent Company), and MnCO
 <sub>3</sub> (AR; Tianjin Sailboats Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were weighed accurately and ground thoroughly in an agate mortar. Then, the obtained mixtures were presintered at 600 °C for 3 h and then resintered at 1500 °C for 6 h. Finally, the samples were cooled slowly to room temperature naturally in the furnace and ground again into powder for subsequent characterization.
