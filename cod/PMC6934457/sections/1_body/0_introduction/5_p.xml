<p id="Par6">In this paper, we report a systematic investigation of amorphous alloy formation in the Ti–Ni–Cu ternary system via a combinatorial approach. The system is well known to have an amorphous composition region and a fast diffuser Ti

 </sup>. The ternary thin-film combinatorial library was fabricated using a sequential multilayered deposition system. High-throughput structural and compositional characterizations were conducted on a synchrotron source and automatic data analysis based on machine learning was employed to quickly generate knowledge of the phase constitution and phase-evolution diagram in the solid-state reaction. Our results demonstrated a high-throughput strategy to systematic and rapid study of crystal-to-glass transition for ternary alloy systems.
