<p id="Par3">Determining the parameters of the chemical reaction zone at the detonation of condensed high explosives (HEs) is a complicated problem of the explosion physics which is important both from the theoretical and the practical point of view. Investigations of the reaction zone is complicated due to the aggressive environment and the high speed of the process: pressure of order of tens of GPa, temperature of several thousand degrees at the characteristic propagation velocity of the detonation of powerful HEs about 8 km/s. The high complexity of the investigation can be illustrated by the fact that the duration of the reaction zone for the same material measured measured by different methods and authors can differ by an order of magnitude
