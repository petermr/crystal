<p>First, a ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> precursor sol was prepared following a synthesis reported elsewhere.

 </sup> Then, a thin ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> film was deposited over a quartz substrate by spin coating (Laurell WS-400) using 190 μL of the ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> precursor sol with an acceleration ramp of 11 340 rpm s
 <sup>–1</sup> and a final rotation speed of 3000 rpm. The film was annealed at 400 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the nanophosphor layers were deposited by spin coating using 180 μL of nanophosphor dispersion with an acceleration ramp of 11 340 rpm s
 <sup>–1</sup> and a final rotation speed between 1500 and 3000 rpm. To obtain layers of different thicknesses, several nanophosphor layers were deposited using the same deposition conditions. Finally, the as-prepared nanophosphor coatings were annealed at 800 °C for 4 h.
