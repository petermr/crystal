<p>(iii) A separation model is obtained by the deliberate reduction of the atoms in the respective SPS. In this manner unit cells are generated containing two single domains separated by a twin plane. To generate a good agreement between the experimental and simulated data, the separation models were adjusted in an iterative approach by shifting the atomic parameters to achieve matching contrast between simulated and experimental images.</p>
