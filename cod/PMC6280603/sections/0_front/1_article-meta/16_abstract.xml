 <p>This data article reports crystal-chemical and structural data (unit cell parameters and internal coordinates) of two hydroxyl minerals, namely brucite [magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)
  <sub>2</sub>] and portlandite [calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)
  <sub>2</sub>], which were calculated and employed to derive the mechanical behavior of these solid phases under hydrostatic compression (Ulian and Valdrè, 2018). The dataset has been obtained by 
  <italic>ab initio</italic> quantum mechanical means, by employing Density Functional Theory methods, in particular the B3LYP hybrid functional, all-electron Gaussian-type orbitals basis sets and a correction to take into account the effects of dispersive forces. Equilibrium and expanded/compressed models of both minerals were realized and geometrically optimized within two space group settings,
