<p>DFT calculations were performed to gain insight in the self-sorting behavior of cages Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> and Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub>. The structures of all possible cage diastereomers were optimized using B3LYP/6-31G(d) for C,H,N and LANL2DZ with ECP for Pd in the gas phase without counter ions. The optimized structure of Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> is in good agreement with the solved X-ray structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, the calculations revealed that the homochiral cage Pd
 <sub>2</sub>((
 <italic>S,S</italic>)-stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> (and its enantiomer) are energetically favored by at least 61 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> compared to the other possible diastereomers (Table S1, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>). Similar calculations on the diastereomers of Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> revealed that the homochiral cage diastereomers Pd
 <sub>2</sub>((
 <italic>S,S</italic>)-stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> are energetically favored as well, by at least 19 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> (Table S2, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>). These calculations support that these cages are formed by chiral narcissistic self-sorting.
