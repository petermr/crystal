 <caption> Schematic of the fabrication process of the wind speed sensor. a) The dimension of the TIEL material is 5 × 10 cm 2. b) The TIEL material is cut into slices with a cut to uncut ratio of 4:1. c) The width of the sliced TIEL material is 3 mm. d) The wind speed sensor consists of four components: 1) a cylinder with four grooves; 2) a hollow ring with four cross‐shaped ridges for adhesion with the TIEL material; 3) a perovskite‐based PD; 4) a round base. e) The front view and f) side view of the wind speed sensor. g) Photograph of the wind speed sensor without the TIEL material. </caption>
