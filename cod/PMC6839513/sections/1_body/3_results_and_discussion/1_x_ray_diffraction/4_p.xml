<p>A unit cell of the new phenytoin form can be found, for example, by using the information on the peak positions and feeding this into a structure indexing software (DICVol04).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
 </sup> This software aims to find a unit cell just by knowing the experimentally determined 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacings so that only the knowledge on the magnitude |
 <bold>q</bold>| of the scattering vector is needed, discarding any information on the position in 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>p</sub> or 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub>. This approach yields a unit cell that explains the observed peak positions very well. The parameters extracted are given in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref> together with experimental literature data. Unlike 
 <bold>form I</bold>, which is orthorhombic, the 
 <bold>form II</bold> unit cell is monoclinic, with the monoclinic angle of 95.43°. Its unit cell axes 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> are shorter, resulting in a cell volume that is about 5% smaller than the volume of the bulk phase 
 <bold>form I</bold>.
