<p>Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements were carried out at a temperature of 10 K on the (001) surfaces of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> crystals cleaved in a 10
 <sup>–9</sup> Pa vacuum. Linearly (s and p) polarized light with photon energies in the range 50–120 eV was used. Experiments were performed at the Electron Spectro-Microscopy (ESM) beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS-II). The photoemitted electrons were collected from a ±15° cone by a Scienta DA30 instrument and analyzed with angular and energy resolutions of &lt;0.2° and 15 meV, respectively. Core level spectra using 300 eV photons showed presence of no elements other than Sn, Eu, and P in the material. Potassium adsorption, commonly used to fill a material’s bands with additional electrons to increase the Fermi Level at the surface of a sample, resulted in surface deterioration in the case of EuSn
