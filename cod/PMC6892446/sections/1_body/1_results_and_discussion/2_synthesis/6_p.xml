The slightly lower alkali metal content might be a result of the washing process with methanol under ambient conditions and a decomposition at the surfaces. All three oxohydroxoferrates are also unstable against the electron beam if the acceleration voltage exceeds about 10 kV, which hampers the EDX analysis (Figure S11, Supporting Information).
