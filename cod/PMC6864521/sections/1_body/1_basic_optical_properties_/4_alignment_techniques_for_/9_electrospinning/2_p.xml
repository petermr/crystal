<p>The electrospinning uses a high electric field to fabricate nanofiber bundles, which are collected by a high‐speed rotating disk and drum, producing large sheets. The diameter of the electrospun nanofibers mainly depends on the polymer concentration in the dispersed QR solution used for the electrospinning process. The rotation speed of the drum controls the alignment of the nanofibers in the sheet. The electrospinning approach was first proposed for the alignment of the gold nanorods,

 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Recently, the company Merck has used the same approach to make nanofiber bundles and sheets containing QRs.[qv: 30a] Various aspects of nanofiber processing have been studied, such as the polymer concentration dependence of the diameter of the electrospun nanofibers and effect of the rotation speed of the drum on the alignment quality of QRs. Merck has achieved good polarization ratio for the 6 × 10 cm
 <sup>2</sup> QREF, which is characterized by high uniformity and DOP of 0.6, see

 </xref>. This approach appears to be useful to produce highly uniform QR films; though, strong electric fields and somewhat complicated fabrication process impose hurdles on the commercialization of this method.
