 <caption> Analyses and evaluation of the optical properties and performances of 2D perovskite under pressure. ( A) A typical set of excitation powerâ€“dependent PL spectra of 2D perovskite at 2.7 GPa. ( B) Power-law fittings of power-dependent PL intensity of 2D perovskite at all pressures; the dotted arrow points to the direction of increasing pressure. ( C) Pressure dependence of intensity coefficient and average PL lifetime of 2D perovskite. ( D) Evolution of PL energy position and the corresponding relative quantum yield. The green trace shows the reversibility of the PL during decompression, which only happens in optical reversible region less than 3.5 GPa. </caption>
