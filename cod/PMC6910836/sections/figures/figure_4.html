 <caption> Structure simulations and vibration analyses of Sn 12 oxide SNCs. Simulated spectra (dashed line) of ( A) Sn 12O 17 and ( B) Sn 12O 25H 16 along with the spectrum of Sn 12 oxide SNCs acquired using the Au@Ag SHINERS method (solid line). ( C) Sn 12O 25H 16 cluster structure as simulated by DFT calculations after the structural optimization process. The Raman signal from the silicon substrate is indicated by an asterisk. </caption>
