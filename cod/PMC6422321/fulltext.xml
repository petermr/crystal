in rare-earth (RE) nanocrystals, the so-called
nanophosphors, is generally achieved by choosing a host that enables
an effective excitation of the RE activator through charge or energy
transfer. Although tungstate, molybdate, or vanadate compounds provide
the aforementioned transfer, a comparative analysis of the efficiency
of such emitters remains elusive. Herein, we perform a combined structural
and optical analysis, which reveals that the tetragonal GdVO<sub>4</sub> matrix gives rise to the highest efficiency among the different

a precise dynamic tuning of the chromaticity based on the photoexcitation
wavelength dependence of the emission of the nanophosphor ensemble
without altering the chemical composition of the emitters or degrading

one of the most efficient transparent white converter coatings ever
developed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transparent coatings</kwd><kwd>phosphor materials</kwd><kwd>rare-earth

coatings based on rare-earth (RE)-doped phosphors
are the key ingredients in recent light-emitting devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Their robustness lies in the high chemical and
thermal stability of their optical performance, which makes them almost
insensitive to temperature or environmental changes. The canonical
configuration found in most luminaries of this kind consists of an
electroluminescent blue-light-emitting diode (LED) used to photoexcite
a thick coating of cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Ce-YAG) crystals,
which emits a broad band in the green-to-red region of the visible
spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The combination of such photoluminescence
(PL) with a part of the incoming blue light that passes through the
color converter without being absorbed results in the white light
we are accustomed to.</p><p>This highly successful approach has, however,
certain drawbacks.
One of them is that it yields a cool shade of white light, and it
is hard to tune the chromaticity of the emission; the other is that
it cannot be employed to obtain transparent photoluminescent displays.
The reason is the strong diffuse scattering that occurs inside the
color-converting layer, which is a disordered packing of large irregular
phosphor crystals (several micrometers of average size). The limitations
imposed by this lack of transparency have motivated the search for
ways to obtain optical-quality Ce-YAG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Murai et al.
have actually shown that it is possible to synthesize this material
in the form of thin films with optical quality. However, the low extinction
coefficient at short visible wavelengths hinders the consecution of
a balanced white with thin films. Also, a wide variety of matrices
have been doped with one or several kinds of RE cations, including
glass ceramics, metal organic frameworks, layered hydroxides, and
so forth, with the aim of achieving transparency and white emission
simultaneously, but low efficiency is achieved in most cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Another approach to prepare transparent phosphor layers is based
on the use of RE nanocrystals or nanophosphors. Although transparent,
nanophosphor films generally feature low brightness and low quantum
yield (QY) because of the small absorption cross section of RE cations
and the large surface-to-volume ratio of as-synthesized nanocrystals,
which represent the main barriers for practical applications. To improve
the emission of these materials, a judicious choice of the inorganic
host material along with its crystal structure is central. Indeed,
tungstate, molybdate, and vanadate compounds are of special interest
in this regard as they enable the excitation of RE cations through
energy transfer from the host that is more efficient than the direct
excitation, which results in a higher brightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> However, a comparative study
of the QY of such compounds is still missing.</p><p>In this paper,
we describe a synthetic route to attain scattering-free
films made of RE-activated NaGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, LaVO<sub>4</sub>, and GdVO<sub>4</sub> nanophosphors
and perform a systematic evaluation of their performance on the basis
of their QY. Then, we use the most efficient host to prepare red-
and green-emitting phosphor layers based on Eu<sup>3+</sup> and Dy<sup>3+</sup> activators, which, combined in a bilayer structure, yield
transparent and efficient phosphor coatings that emit white light.
We optimize the thickness of the constituent layers to achieve a total
extinction of the incoming photoexcitation as well as a bright white-light
emission of tunable shade. The absence of light scattering in the
stack provides both transparency and efficient photoexcitation of
the inner layers. The shade of the emitted light from a given coating
can be continuously tuned without altering the chemical composition
of the emitters by means of the gradual shift of the photoexcitation
wavelength, a consequence of the spectral dependence of the light
penetration depth. The total extinction of the incoming radiation
along with QYs above 35% make these layered phosphors one of the most
efficient transparent white converter coatings ever developed. Central
to this achievement is the formation of a thin (hundreds of nanometers)
plane parallel packing of RE nanophosphors by wet deposition methods
that was later sintered at a high temperature in a controlled way;
hence, transparency was preserved all through the process. As a result,
phosphor films displaying simultaneously high QY, bright-colored emission,
and transparency are achieved.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>To prepare thin phosphor films with high optical quality, nanophosphors
must feature a small nanoparticle size to avoid light scattering and
high colloidal stability in polar solvents to prepare colloidal suspensions
that are stable. In particular, nanophosphors employed in our investigation
are synthesized following a solvothermal route and polyacrylic acid
(PAA) as the functionalization agent, which not only has an important
effect on the size and shape of the final nanocrystals but also increases
the surface charge value that results in the stability of the suspension.
The luminescent properties of nanophosphors arise from the interplay
among a variety of factors ranging from composition to crystallinity
or surface properties, and it is hard to foresee their efficiency
prior to fabrication. We investigate nanophosphors based on NaGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, LaVO<sub>4</sub>, and GdVO<sub>4</sub> as inorganic hosts, as these matrices
enable the excitation of the activator through an efficient energy
transfer from the host to Eu<sup>3+</sup>, which results in brighter
materials. In fact, the absorption bands of RE activators are generally
associated to f&#x02013;f transitions, being spectrally narrow and
featuring low absorption cross sections. For this reason, aiming to
improve the brightness of these materials, a wise choice of the inorganic
host material enables the excitation of the activator through energy
transfer from the host. However, such transfer bands lie in the ultraviolet
B or ultraviolet C region of the spectrum, where commercial diodes
are rather inefficient nowadays, despite the swift increase in the
demand for efficient UV light sources for applications that go beyond
lighting, such as printing, curing, or disinfection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a&#x02013;d shows a scanning electron micrograph of a top view of
such films with controllable thickness and high optical quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Indeed, nanophosphor films are prepared by spin coating using alcoholic
dispersions. Our method allows the fabrication of bright, transparent,
and efficient thin films using a facile wet deposition route. Notice
that compared with other coating techniques such as spray coating,
sputtering, or screen printing, spin coating represents a simple and
inexpensive alternative to prepare uniform layers of high optical
quality with a film thickness that can be accurately controlled. Then,
films are annealed at 800 &#x000b0;C&#x02014;see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e&#x02013;h&#x02014;to improve their emission
properties, as both crystallinity and the crystallite size enlarge
with temperature, yielding higher QY values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> In general, the bond length and optical electronegativity of the
ligand affect the crystal field strength significantly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> whereas the varying O&#x02013;Gd&#x02013;O or O&#x02013;La&#x02013;O
bond angle alters the distortions of the GdO<sub>8</sub> or LaO<sub>8</sub> dodecahedron in the structure. Therefore, the choice of the
host materials determines the crystal field strength and the lanthanide
site, which have a great influence on the PL properties of Eu<sup>3+</sup>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>i shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded for the nanophosphors
after sintering at 800 &#x000b0;C. Doped NaGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, LaVO<sub>4</sub>, and GdVO<sub>4</sub> particles feature a crystallite size of &#x0223c;49, &#x0223c;93,
&#x0223c;81, and &#x0223c;73 nm, and grow into tetragonal, tetragonal,
monoclinic, and tetragonal structures, respectively, which can be
verified by the ICDD files numbered 00-25-0829, 00-25-0828, 01-070-2392,
and 01-086-0996. We have included the (<italic>hkl</italic>) index
of the different peaks observed in the diffraction patterns, which
demonstrates the formation of single host phases. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>j gives the excitation and
emission spectra of the nanophosphor films annealed at 800 &#x000b0;C
for 4 h. The photoexcitation spectra monitored at the emission peak
of Eu<sup>3+</sup> are composed of a broad and intense band because
of the charge transfer within the anions (WO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup>, MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup>, and VO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup>) of the matrices and from Eu<sup>3+</sup> to O<sup>2&#x02212;</sup>, which indicates the existence of energy transfer from the hosts
to Eu<sup>3+</sup>. The typical emission profile of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions is observed when exciting at 300 nm. We can assign the different
bands observed at &#x0223c;580, &#x0223c;615, &#x0223c;650, and &#x0223c;700
nm in the PL spectrum of the different nanophosphor films to the characteristic
transition lines from the excited <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> level
to <sup>7</sup>F<sub>1</sub>, <sup>7</sup>F<sub>2</sub>, <sup>7</sup>F<sub>3</sub>, and <sup>7</sup>F<sub>4</sub> levels of Eu<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. As these transitions are associated to the activator,
all fabricated Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor films display similar
emission bands in the PL spectra. However, the differences in the
symmetry of the lattice site occupied by the activator or the local
crystal environment provided by the host give rise to the variations
observed in the fine features of the emission spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> To evaluate the performance of the different
films fabricated, we measure the QY of NaGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, LaVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor films, obtaining 10, 15, 25, and 75%, respectively.
This group of nanophosphors allows the comparison of materials with
the same crystalline structure but different composition, that is,
NaGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, and similar chemical composition but different crystalline structure,
that is, LaVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>. Although disparities in the QY values experimentally observed
may originate from the different transfer efficiencies between the
host and the activator or from the variations in the crystal structure,
which affect the radiative rate of the activator, only rigorous calculations
of the electronic structure of these materials could provide an ultimate
answer for the physical origin of the differences found between the
experimental efficiency values.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a&#x02013;h) SEM images of the top surface

tunable white-light-emitting phosphor coatings,
the most efficient GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor film
was employed as the red-emitting sublayer and the Dy<sup>3+</sup>-doped
GdVO<sub>4</sub> as the green sublayer. As depicted by the black solid
line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a,
GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> nanophosphor features narrow emission
lines in the blue (483 nm) and yellow (572 nm) regions of the visible
spectrum. By comparing the excitation spectra of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> shown by the dashed
lines in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a,
one can notice that they are almost identical, which demonstrates
the occurrence of energy transfer from the host to Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions. Layered phosphor coatings were fabricated by sequential spin
coating of nanophosphors. To improve the adhesion to the substrate
(quartz), the phosphor bilayer is deposited over a thin layer of ZrO<sub>2</sub>. We observed that such a layer improves the uniformity of
the nanophosphor films deposited atop, which may originate from the
different surface charge of the ZrO<sub>2</sub> film compared to the
quartz substrate. To achieve white-light emission, stacks with a total
thickness of &#x0223c;500 nm were prepared, so that full extinction
of the photoexcitation was guaranteed as it would be required if these
coatings are integrated as downshifters in light-emitting devices.
Indeed, our measurements indicate that the PL intensity increases
with the thickness of the films up to &#x0223c;350 nm, meaning that
such value of film thickness is enough so as to absorb the complete
fraction of the excitation light that is not reflected in the nanophosphor/air
interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Eventually, layered coatings
were sintered at 800 &#x000b0;C. Thermal annealing gives rise to porous
but continuous films in which structural defects and surface traps
present in the as-prepared nanocrystals are reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> A field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image
of the cross section of one of these stacks is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b. As the crystalline matrix
hosting the two types of cations employed is the same, each layer
in the stack responds equally to the thermal treatment, making the
interface between the two types of RE-doped layers indistinguishable.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Normalized

The illustrative results attained for a bilayer stack composed of
&#x0223c;300 nm of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> and &#x0223c;200
nm of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c. The transmittance remains
above 70% for the complete visible range, with oscillations that arise
as a result of the optical interference occurring in the layered stack.
The fraction of light absorbed by the bilayer reaches 70% in the UV
range at which the phosphors of choice are excited, with the remaining
light at these short wavelengths diffusely scattered by the disordered
pore network present in the sintered films. Hence, although the random
porous network observable in the bulk of the film does not give rise
to diffuse visible light, it scatters shorter wavelength photons to
some non-negligible extent. The transparency (&#x003c4;) of the stacks
can be formally estimated with the expression (ISO 9050:2003)<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="am-2018-173682_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>where <italic>P</italic>(&#x003bb;) is the photopic
spectral luminous efficiency function, which represents the sensitivity
of an observer in photometry (ISO/CIE 10527), and <italic>F</italic> is the AM1.5 solar spectral irradiance. The values of &#x003c4; for
all coatings were basically the same and around 75%. The pictures
displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>d,e confirm that the resulting films are highly transparent and emit
white light when illuminated with an adequate UV light. Notice that
UV LEDs in combination with phosphor mixtures typically provide sources
with a higher color-rendering index, which could potentially minimize
light pollution.</p><p>The photophysical properties of the coatings
were studied by means
of photoexcitation and PL spectroscopies using a spectrofluorometer
(Edinburgh FLS1000). The excitation wavelength (&#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub>) was varied from 250 to 320 nm. The results for a particular configuration,
namely a bilayer stack composed of &#x0223c;300 nm of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> and &#x0223c;200 nm of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> annealed films, are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a. Notice that the thickness of each nanophosphor layer
can be precisely controlled through the concentration of the nanophosphor
dispersion and the deposition speed. As a result, the film thickness
can be processed with a precision of a few nanometers. Interestingly,
the PL spectra are extremely dependent on the excitation wavelength.
This is a direct consequence of the layered structure of the coating.
In the selected example, light encounters first the GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> layer and then the GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> one. The shorter the wavelength, the smaller is the penetration
depth in the stack. Hence, for 250 nm &#x02264; &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> &#x02264; 290, all incoming intensities are practically absorbed
by the GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> layer and hardly reach the
second GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> layer. Hence, the features
of Dy<sup>3+</sup> dominate over those of Eu<sup>3+</sup> in the PL
spectrum. As the photoexcitation wavelength increases, the penetration
depth also increases, and the balance between the contributions from
both species improves, as it can be seen for those spectra attained
when photoexciting with 295 nm &#x02264; &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> &#x02264;
320. This is further illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b, in which the PL spectra attained when
illuminating the same bilayer at either &#x003bb; = 275 nm (black) or
&#x003bb; = 300 nm (gray) are plotted. Although both emissions lie in
the achromatic region of the chromaticity space, their spectral composition
is very different. Remarkably, the tuning of the emission shade is
not achieved at the expense of a significant reduction of the amount
of emitted light. Indeed, although the extinction coefficient of the
phosphor reduces by 60% from &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> = 265 nm to &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> = 320 nm, the total emitted light only diminishes by 15%
when photoexciting at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> = 320 nm. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c shows the time-dependent
PL of the <sup>4</sup>F<sub>9/2</sub> level of Dy<sup>3+</sup> and
the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> level of Eu<sup>3+</sup> activators
when they form an isolated film and when such films are stacked in
a bilayer. Our results indicate that the structuring of the phosphors
does not alter their dynamics, and the associated lifetimes are nearly
identical. Indeed, the fitting of the decay curves yields the average
lifetimes of 0.22 and 0.94 ms for Dy<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. The QY of the Dy<sup>3+</sup> layer is &#x0223c;25%,
whereas the Eu<sup>3+</sup> film features an efficiency of &#x0223c;75%,

displayed herein offers a unique
and unprecedented way to control the shade of the emission color attained
from a phosphor coating. In this regard, the potential of these transparent
stacks is analyzed by studying the PL of the GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup>/GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> stack in comparison with
a 500 nm film in which GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> phosphor nanoparticles were mixed together
at two different ratios. A gradual shift of the excitation energy
allows attaining different chromaticity values comprised between the
one of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>&#x02014;open symbols in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a. As it can be seen in the CIE 1931 color
space plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a, a variety of shades contained in the achromatic region are achieved.
In particular, the photoexcitation of the GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup>/GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> stack at &#x003bb;<sub>ex</sub> = 300 nm yields a warm white light, meeting the Planckian locus
at 2600 K. Similarly, when the order of the layers in the stack is
reversed, that is, GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>/GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup>, the color of the emission can be also controlled
with the photoexcitation wavelength, as shown with red symbols in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a. In contrast, when
the GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> and GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> phosphor nanoparticles are mixed together in a film, the chromaticity
of the emission is only determined by the ratio of each material in
the mix, for example, 85% of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> or 60%
of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup> nanophosphors, and the color coordinates
of the homogeneous mixture are independent of the photoexcitation
wavelength, as shown by dark and gray symbols in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a, which highlights the importance
of the phosphor layering to tune the emission color of a given film.
Notice that we did not consider preparing films of codoped GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Dy<sup>3+</sup>/Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanophosphors to avoid processes
related to cross-relaxation and energy transfer between the energy
levels of Dy<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup>, which generally deteriorate
the yield of the individual activators. Finally, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b&#x02013;e displays the digital
pictures of the light emitted by the coatings, which highlight the
precision in determining the coating response that can be achieved
by combining the adequate bilayer configuration and excitation wavelength.
We have demonstrated that both routes (mixing and layering) allow
tuning the emission color of a combination of phosphors. Indeed, our
measurements confirm that chromaticity coordinates can be accurately
controlled by engineering the relative ratio between the Dy<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> nanoparticles in the mixture. However, different
emission colors require the preparation of different coatings. In
contrast, the layering approach offers the possibility to tune the
chromaticity of the emission of a given coating by changing the photoexcitation
wavelength, which represents its main benefit.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a) CIE 1931 chromaticity

host
for Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions over the NaGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaGd(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and LaVO<sub>4</sub> materials.
We have also demonstrated a synthetic route to attain a transparent
white-light-emitting coating based on a layered phosphor structure.</p><p>The choice of materials determines the range of white shades in
which the chromaticity can be tuned. In our demonstration, we choose
two nanophosphors that yield warm white light (2600 K) when combined
in a stack that is photoexcited with light of 300 nm. High efficiency
as well as a dynamic chromatic tuning of PL has been shown. The combination
of these features with the level of transparency achieved allows us
to foresee a great potential impact of the approach proposed herein
in the field of solid-state lighting and displays. These novel color-converting
coatings are also easily processed and are versatile in terms of the
substrate they can be deposited on. Future developments must target
the development of layered phosphor coatings that can be efficiently
photoexcited at longer wavelengths, for which more efficient electroluminescence
sources exist, so that a high electrical-to-luminous power conversion
ratio can be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Experimental

the light emitted and light absorbed by the nanophosphor films. Thus,
they comprise processes from the absorption of the excitation light
by the nanophosphor matrix to the transfer to the RE activator and
the subsequent outcoupling to free space of the emitted light. The
measurements were performed using an integrating sphere attached to
