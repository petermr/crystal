<p>(iv) Obtaining the dense point cloud: Starting from the orientation elements obtained in the adjustment of the dispersed cloud to improve the coordinates of the projection centers, the photogrammetric correlation is carried out pixel by pixel. For this purpose, algorithms of the type path-based multi-view stereo (PVMS) are used, which is based on an adjustment by least squares with geometric constraints [
