<p id="Par8">Here, using a concept of ambiguity-free orientation determination data analysis and simultaneous registration of multiple Raman scattering spectra obtained at different polarizations, our approach allows for 2D and 3D quantitative orientation mapping of multigrain materials. First results for silicon, a pharmaceutical tablet and for sapphire reveal favorable specifications: sub-micrometer resolution, fast data acquisition, and a high orientation resolution. The method applies to all Raman active materials independent of crystal symmetry and requires no sample preparation.</p>
