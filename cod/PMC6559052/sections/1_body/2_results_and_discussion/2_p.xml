<p>By including an occupancy parameter to quantify the surface coverage of the (2 × 1) reconstruction, the model can determine if there is a “mixed” (2 × 1) reconstruction, in which both (1 × 1) and (2 × 1) domains exist or that there is a complete removal of the (2 × 1) termination. It was found during the fitting procedure that the occupancy of the (2 × 1) domains tended to a value close to zero, that is, the χ
 <sup>2</sup> reduces as the surface coverage of the (2 × 1) reconstruction reduces. This indicates that the presence of water induces more than just relaxations of substrate atoms at the interface and points to a model in which the substrate exhibits a bulk-like (1 × 1) termination. This is consistent with both theoretical (DFT) and experimental (STM) studies that have suggested a phase transition from (2 × 1) to (1 × 1) in the presence of water.
