 <caption> Electrochemical performance of Co 3Sn 2S 2 single-crystal catalyst. ( A) OER polarization curves for Ni foam, Co 3Sn 2S 2 single crystal, and Co 3Sn 2S 2 micropowder crushed from the single crystal. ( B) Overpotential of Co 3Sn 2S 2 single-crystal catalyst at 10 mA cm −2 compared with some recently reported results for OER electrocatalysts. ( C) Tafel plot of Ni foam, Co 3Sn 2S 2 single crystal and Co 3Sn 2S 2 micropowder Koutecky-Levich plots in O 2-saturated 1 M KOH solution. The wide linear regime indicates the excellent electron transfer kinetics even at large overpotential. RHE, reverse hydrogen electrode. ( D) Multicurrent process with the current density increased from 10 to 85 mA cm −2 without iR correction. </caption>
