<p id="Par14">With regard to the channel morphology, we note that the channels in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d)</xref> are relatively straight, similar to those observed in irradiated fcc metals for all damage levels

 </sup>. With increasing dose, one may expect that the straight slip channels in bcc tungsten will not only become wider, but also curved. For example in neutron irradiated bcc vanadium, wide, river-pattern shaped channels have been observed with increasing dose from 0.12 to 0.69 dpa

 </sup>. The high stacking fault energy (SFE) in bcc metals is expected to promote cross-slip of screw dislocations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, while in low SFE fcc metals, cross-slip is harder to initiate owing to the formation of partial dislocations. Multiple cross-slip events per dislocation can help the formation of curved channels in bcc metals as each cross-slip induces a sharp change in direction of the dislocation path
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the SFE may be considered responsible for differences in the slip channel morphology between bcc and fcc metals, particularly at high doses
