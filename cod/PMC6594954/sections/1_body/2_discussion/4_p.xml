<p id="Par16">The present study further proves the powerful capabilities of high pressure as a tool for tuning chemical properties of matter. Growing interest of the chemical community in high-pressure SCXRD techniques using diamond anvil cells (DACs) ensures that the upcoming studies will bring further examples of unique phases as well as provide a solid experimental basis for the future development of novel high-pressure crystal chemistry.</p>
