<p>The calculations carried out with all-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals (AE–LCAO) have been performed using the CRYSTAL software (Dovesi et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In the AE–LCAO formalism implemented in CRYSTAL (Dovesi et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the crystalline orbitals are expanded as a linear combination of atom centered Gaussian orbitals with 
 <italic>s</italic>, 
 <italic>p</italic>, or 
 <italic>d</italic> symmetry (the basis set). AE calculations were performed in which there is no shape approximation to the potential or density.
