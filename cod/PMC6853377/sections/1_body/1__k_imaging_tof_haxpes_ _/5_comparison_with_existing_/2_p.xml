<p>Full-field imaging of large 2D angular ranges is also exploited in the family of angular-resolving time-of-flight photoemission instruments and in various display-type analyzers. Here we discuss the similarities and differences of these approaches as compared with the present instrument, in particular concerning energy and angular/momentum resolution. The comparison includes also hemispherical analyzers that almost exclusively govern the field of HAXPES so far.</p>
