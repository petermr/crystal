<p>Despite a great number of calculations of the electronic structures of these compounds, they were made using different approximations. Thus, it is useful for their overview and comparison to be based on a unified approach for the whole range of monosilicides, and to add the band structures of TcSi, ReSi, and RhSn that were not considered before. Due to emerging attention to their band structure topology and persistent interest to their thermoelectric applications, here we also discuss the influence of the electronic structure on these properties.</p>
