<p>As described in the 
 <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Methods section</xref>, possible candidate structures for 
 <bold>forms I</bold> and 
 <bold>II</bold> were identified among the computed structures by matching computed lattice parameters and GIXD patterns against their experimental equivalents. Local stability of the lattice was then checked by computing the vibrational frequencies.
