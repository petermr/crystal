 <caption> Structural elements of mullite and site labels. Subsequent layers are shown with decreased opacity. Chains of AlO 6 octahedra (dark blue) are interlinked by diclusters consisting of two T sites and triclusters consisting of two T sites and a T* site. Two triclusters always embrace the void of an oxygen vacancy like the one between the two labelled T* sites. Octahedrally coordinated Al1 atoms are bonded to four O1 atoms and two O2 atoms. The bridging oxygens of diclusters and triclusters are labelled O3 and O4, respectively. Cations on the T site are labelled Al2 or Si2, and on the T* site Al3 or Si3. The unit-cell borders of the mullite average structure are marked by black lines. </caption>
