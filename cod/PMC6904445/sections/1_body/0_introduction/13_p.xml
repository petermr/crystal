<p id="Par14">In order to disentangle the underlying processes that can be associated with the emergence of the anomaly observed at T
 <sub>1</sub>, we have studied the polar properties of the tetragonal GMO thin film. For this purpose, we have measured the thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) in heating runs, at fixed temperature rate of 8 K/min, in two distinct poling conditions: the sample was cooled i) in the absence of an electric field, and ii) under different bias electric fields: 1.0; 2.5; and 5.0 kV/m. The TSDC was measured in the absence of an applied electric field. The results are displayed in Fig.
