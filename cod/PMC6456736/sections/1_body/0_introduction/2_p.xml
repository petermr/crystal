<p id="Par4">The design of narrow-band cyan-emitting phosphors plays a significant role in enhancing the color rendition to compensate for the peak valley between the blue and yellow emission peaks. However, luminous efficacy and color rendition are generally in a trade-off relationship
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the narrow-band characteristic will decrease the opportunity for spectral overlapping of the excitation spectrum of YAG:Ce and emission spectrum of the cyan-emitting phosphor, which avoids the reabsorption effect to realize the maximum achievable luminous efficacy
