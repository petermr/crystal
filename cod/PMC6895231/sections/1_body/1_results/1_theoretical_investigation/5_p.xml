<p id="Par13">Ambiguity simulation results for a multi-grain sample with different numbers of measurement channels are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The column “Orientation error” shows the percentage of the area where the local orientation is correctly determined. The maximum orientation error registered in the successfully fitted zones is shown in the column “Misorientation” in Table
