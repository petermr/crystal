 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref> shows the corresponding 2D mapping of O 1 
 <italic>s</italic> photoemission integrated in the binding energy region of 522.5–546.5 eV. Images from a low magnification to high magnification were obtained from both microscopes. The micro-grid was overlapped on the single crystalline LCO particle in the 2D image obtained with the optical microscope while it was almost invisible in the O 1
 <italic>s</italic> photoemission image. At the center of the LCO particle, marked by a black circle in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>, wide scan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(c)</xref>) and Li 1
 <italic>s</italic>/Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> narrow scan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(d)</xref>) XPS spectra were obtained at the initial condition, after charge up to 4.5 V, and after discharge down to 2.8 V. While strong O 1
 <italic>s</italic> and C 1
 <italic>s</italic> sharp peaks were detected, the narrow scan XPS spectra clearly identified the Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> peak and a small contribution of the Li 1
 <italic>s</italic> peak
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. The Co 3
 <italic>p</italic> peak profile could be fitted with three Gaussian curves for Co 3
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub>, Co 3
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> and satellite peaks
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. Noted that the three peaks had identical energy and no drastic change of relative intensity ratios among the initial, charge and discharge conditions. It was considered that strong hybridization between Co 3
 <italic>d</italic> and O 2
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup> made holes created by the charge reaction that were localized at the oxygen side, because changes in the O 
 <italic>K</italic>-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) for LCO upon the charge process were greater than those in the Co 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>2,3</sub>-edge XAS in previous 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> XAS studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, the O 2
 <italic>p</italic> orbital should play an important role in the redox reaction rather than the Co 3
 <italic>d</italic> orbital. We could not obtain detailed information from the narrow scan O 2
 <italic>p</italic> and 1
 <italic>s</italic> spectra owing to the significant overlap of background noise by the oxygen components in the dry polymer, which were excited by a stray X-rays from outside the active area of the FZP.
