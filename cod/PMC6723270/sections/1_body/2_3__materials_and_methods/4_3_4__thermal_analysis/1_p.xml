<p>The thermal stability of the materials was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a TA instruments, model TGA Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instrument, Delawere, DE, USA). Measurements were made on 10.0 mg of sample, using a high-resolution algorithm (sensitivity: 1, resolution: 5) with N
 <sub>2</sub> flow (100 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>) at a heating rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The measurement range was from 21 up to 800 °C.
