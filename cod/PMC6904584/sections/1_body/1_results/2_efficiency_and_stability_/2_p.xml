<p id="Par8">It has been widely reported that mixed-halide perovskites, such as CsPb(Br
 <sub>0.5</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.5</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>, undergo a quick phase segregation under electric field, caused by charge-enhanced ion migration

 </sup>. Such phase segregation can generate bromine-rich domains and chlorine-rich domains in CsPb(Br
 <sub>0.5</sub>Cl

 <sub>3</sub> films, resulting in severe change of electroluminescent (EL) spectrum during the operation of PeLEDs

 </sup>. We tested the EL spectrum and luminance stabilities of the most efficient sky-blue PeLEDs to evaluate whether such a phase segregation occurs in these mixed perovskite films. In striking contrast, we found the EL spectra are very stable for the PEACl:CsPbBr

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> shows the EL emission spectra of the sky-blue PeLED under constant bias of 3.2 V for 120 min. The device shows a stable EL emission with a peak at 485 nm. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> also shows negligible EL spectrum variation of the device under varied biases. The EL luminance stability of PeLEDs was also tested by fixing the applied voltage bias of 3.2 V, with an initial luminance around 100 cd m
