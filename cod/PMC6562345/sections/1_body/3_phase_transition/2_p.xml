<p>We now turn to the phase transition itself. It is familiar behaviour that, starting from the orthorhombic phase of 
 <bold>MnGF</bold> or 
 <bold>CoGF</bold>, the same rhombohedral phase can be achieved either by applying pressure or by increasing the cation size. For instance, many NaCl-type alkali halides and pseudohalides transform to the CsCl structure under pressure [

 <sub>3</sub> adopts the CaIrO
 <sub>3</sub> structure [
