<p>Along the last decade, several LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>-MgH
 <sub>2</sub> composites have been studied for hydrogen storage [
 <xref rid="B90-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The main results coincide in that the dehydrogenation pathway is marked by three steps, the usual two of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and one of MgH
 <sub>2</sub>. The temperature of these dehydrogenation steps is somewhat reduced compared to the pure components. Even more, the use of additives, such as TiH
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], TiF
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B90-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], MnFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B91-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], or HfCl
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B93-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], reduced approximately up to 60 Â°C the dehydrogenation temperatures as compared to the mixture without additives. The role of the additives is to reduce the activation energy of dehydrogenation [
 <xref rid="B93-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Other points of coincidence are the formation of Mg-Al and Li-Mg compounds of relatively varied stoichiometry after dehydrogenation and the occurrence of partial reversibility dominated by MgH
 <sub>2</sub> rehydrogenation without indications of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> rehydrogenation.
