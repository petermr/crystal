 <caption> Experimental electronic structure of EuMnBi 2 and YbMnBi 2 and evidence for canting. a Fermi surface map of EuMnBi 2. White arrows with numbers indicate the directions along which the spectra in the panels to the right have been recorded. Data are taken using 27 eV photons (cut #1 at 44 eV). No Dirac crossings are seen in this case. b Same as ( a), but for YbMnBi 2. Zero momentum in panel with the cut #2 ( hν = 80 eV) corresponds to the BZ center. Dashed lines in the panel with cut #3 are guides to eye representing splitting of the degenerate bands due to TRS breaking. Crossings of these bands near the Fermi level are Weyl points. c Magneto-optical images of the YbMnBi 2 (left) and EuMnBi 2 (right) crystals, observed under conditions of the Voigt effect at perpendicular light incidence. A domain contrast can only be seen on the YbMnBi 2 material, proving the presence and the absence of magnetic moment canting in YbMnBi 2 and EuMnBi 2, respectively (see text). d Schematic results of the band-structure calculations taking into account the canting (10°) resulting in an in-plane ferromagnetic component along the (1,1,0) direction. k x* and k y* are the directions perpendicular to and along the Fermi surface contour, respectively </caption>
