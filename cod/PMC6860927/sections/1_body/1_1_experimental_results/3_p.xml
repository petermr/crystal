<p>The TKD results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1</xref> clearly indicate that the grain boundary region was captured in the analyzed specimen and offer an independent experimental confirmation of the crystallographic character of the interface. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1(a)</xref> is an inverse pole figure map (IPF) along the arbitrarily defined 
 <italic>x</italic>−direction, which is approximately aligned with the axial direction of the specimen. The A1 and A2 directions show the orientation of the EBSD detector relative to the display view. Grain cleanup was performed using a single iteration of grain dilation in the TSL OIM software with a grain tolerance angle of 5° and a minimum grain size of 2 pixels. A thin noisy region between the two grains can be observed, since the boundary plane is not perfectly orthogonal to the viewing plane. For additional clarity between the two grains, a unique grain color map is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1(b)</xref>. The color triangle corresponding to the IPF map in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1(a)</xref> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1(c)</xref>, where the orientation of each grain along this projection is plotted. The unit cell representation of each grain as well as the measured Bunge-Euler notation are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g001">Fig 1(d)</xref>. The disorientation in angle/axis pair representation [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was measured to be 59.3°/[0.590, 0.575, 0.568].
