After that, the ingots were cooled down to 873 K in 8 h before being quenched in water. Subsequently, they were annealed at 553 K for 72 h. After cooling to RT, the ingots were ball milled for 5 h, and the dried powders were then rapidly sintered using the spark plasma sintering apparatus (SPS-1030) specifically programmed with a peak temperature of 823 K and pressure of 55 MPa. The densities of the sintered bulks were measured by using the Archimedes’ method. The bulk samples about the size of 2.5 × 3 × 12 mm
 <sup>3</sup> were prepared for electrical property measurements, and those of ϕ10 × 1.5 mm
 <sup>2</sup> for thermal diffusivity measurement.
