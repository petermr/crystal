<p>The PLQY of 2D perovskites is generally low due to the phase impurity and traps on the film surface from the solution process. In order to improve the luminescence efficiency, some surface modifications have been carried out. Bolink's group reported an impressive PLQY of (BA)

 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0107" ref-type="ref">107</xref> The surface defects are effectively passivated to reduce the nonradiative recombination, so the radiative efficiency is greatly improved. Another example is to coat the surface of quasi‐2D PEA
