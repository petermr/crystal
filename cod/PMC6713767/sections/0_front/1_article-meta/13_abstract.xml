  <sup>2+</sup>-activated phosphors are widely applied in lighting and display areas because of their good optical performance. In this paper, an excellent green-emitting zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor is prepared by a green and eco-friendly high-thermal reaction method without any reducing atmosphere or agents. Meanwhile, the reducing mechanism from Eu
  <sup>3+</sup> ions to Eu
  <sup>2+</sup> ions is investigated. The experiment results show that the morphology, crystal structure, and luminescent property are affected by sintering temperature. The resulting sample shows the broad excitation band is in the range of 310–450 nm and the peak of the broad emission band is located at 523 nm. Furthermore, zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphor is encapsulated on a commercial UV-emitting chip to fabricate a purity green light-emitting diode (LED) with the Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates at (0.295, 0.537).
