<p id="Par8">Another interesting observation is that, for CHO/STO with both terminations, although their conductivities change with the thickness of CHO, there is still measurable conductivity at room temperature even when the thickness of CHO is as thin as 1 uc (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a, b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). We found that the room-temperature conductivity of 1 uc CHO/STO is remarkably stable and showed no obvious aging after 1-year storage. By contrast, when the thickness of LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub> is 3 uc or below, the LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub>/STO heterointerface is highly insulating (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>)

 </sup>. Therefore, there is no strict critical thickness in CHO/STO. These two observations indicate that the EG observed at the CHO/STO heterointerfaces is different from all the previous ones
