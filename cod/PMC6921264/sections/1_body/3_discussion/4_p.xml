<p>Moreover, the interaction with π–π stacking is stronger than that with HBs, which agrees with results from CE-B3LYP. In π–π1 and 2, the interaction energies with PBE0-XDM are estimated to be −11.53 and −9.28 kcal/mol, respectively, greater than the energy with the doublet HBs of −8.05 kcal/mol. The greater interaction energy prefers a greater weight during parameterization, which might make the no-bonding parameters more suitable to describe the π–π interaction. Because of the dominance by the electrostatic effect, the description accuracy of HB interaction should be dependent on the atomic charges. The atomic charges in the FF were obtained referring to the gaseous molecular structure rather than the structure in the crystal, and the effect of the crystal environment on the electrostatic potential were ignored. Moreover, few atomic types make a charge average. All of these might be responsible for the poorer description on HB interaction. Nevertheless, the parameters of the FF are obtained mainly from the unimolecular properties of LLM-105 calculated by DFT, which should describe LLM-105 systems without any preference. Overall, the FF with a general FF form can be applied to investigate the properties of LLM-105.</p>
