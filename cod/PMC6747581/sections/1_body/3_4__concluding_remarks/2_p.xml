<p>Our phonon calculations show that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is dynamically stable as no imaginary frequency was observed. Our elastic constant calculations illustrate that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is mechanically stable. Raman and IR calculations are carried out for TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> and compared with previous experimental and calculated results. Our results seem to be in better agreement with the experimental results than any other calculated results published previously. Our detailed studies of electronic and optical properties of the ternary dichalcogenide material suggest that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is a potential candidate for photovoltaic applications.
