<p>The grain size distribution of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs from DLS is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The grain size was from 2 to 10 nm. The peak appeared at 5.3 nm and approximate 90% of the grains were of the size within 4â€“6 nm. The morphology of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs was observed by HRTEM, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The prepared QDs have a uniform dispersion in the aqueous solution. The Zeta potential of the as-prepared sample was 17.3 mV and it was measured to be 17.1 mV after 3 months of storage at room temperature. Thus, the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs were stable in the aqueous solution for several months. The average grain size was measured to be 2.23 nm. The grain sizes of QDs were from 1.4 nm to 3.4 nm, and over 50% of them were between 2.0 to 2.5 nm. The characteristic spacing of 0.33 nm was observed, corresponding to the (110) planes of the rutile phase of SnO
 <sub>2</sub>.
