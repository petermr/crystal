<p>The dependence of 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>S</sub> and 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>R</sub> on the CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> content is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>
 </xref>. All of the samples from both batches have been represented. As can be clearly seen, both magnitudes increase with the CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> content. For high-purity samples, the values are almost constant, which can be assumed as those corresponding to the pure CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. Overall, the formation of the complex ferrite from its former oxides increases the saturation magnetization, although it is accompanied by a slight increase of the remanence.
