 <caption> ( a) Rietveld refinement of 1.22 g of LiKHC 6H 5O 7 loaded in a 6 mm V can and measured for 2.6 h in the sample changer using a center wavelength of 2.665 Å at room temperature. Light-blue dots represent measured data, the royal-blue line is the model fit to the data and the black line is the difference curve. Tick marks show the locations of the expected Bragg peaks. ( b) The Fourier density of the missing hydrogen is overlaid on the DFT-calculated hydrogen location. </caption>
