<p id="Par23">Alloy ingots are produced by inductive melting of the appropriate amounts of elemental constituents in a quartz tube under inert atmosphere. The purity levels of the constituent elements were as follows: Au 99.99%, Cu 99.995%, Ag 99.95%, Pd 99.95%, and Si 99.9999%. Rod samples and plate coupons are produced by melting the alloy ingots in a furnace at 950 °C under high purity argon inside quartz cylindrical or rectangular tubes having 0.5 mm thick walls, and rapidly quenching in a room-temperature water bath. Rod cross sections and plate surfaces were finely polished to 1 μm diamond mirror finish.</p>
