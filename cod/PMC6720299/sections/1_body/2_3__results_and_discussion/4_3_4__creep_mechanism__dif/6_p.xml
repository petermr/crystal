<p>Through the comparison between

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f007">Figure 7</xref>, it was found that although the vacancy quantity curve and the MSD curve exhibited a similar trend, the time nodes of the curve turning points were somewhat different. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are as follows. In the nanocrystalline material, as creep deformation progresses, the volume fraction of the amorphous structure increasingly accumulates at the grain boundary, and thus a massive number of vacancies are generated. In general, it is relatively easier for atoms to diffuse through vacancies than by substitution, but at sufficiently high temperatures and stress levels, atoms have enough energy to break through barriers and carry out lattice diffusion in the form of substitution. Therefore, the MSD curves not only contain the results of atomic diffusion through vacancies, but also the diffusion of atoms via substitution. These two creep mechanisms can be evidenced from the atomic snapshots of Ovito in
