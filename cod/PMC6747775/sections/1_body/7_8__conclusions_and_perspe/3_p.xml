<p>Despite that the formation of reactive composite materials has proven useful in other hydrogen storage materials, this approach seems not so useful in the alanate family. However, the formation of double cation alanates seems to be attractive for improving the dehydrogenation temperature without the sacrifice of the hydrogen content. The anion substitution is explored to a limited extent in the alanates family, and this modification should be studied deeply. </p>
