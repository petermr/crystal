<p id="p0805">The methods for calculating the shape of the optical bands in polymethine dyes and their aggregates, based on the quantum classical mechanics of electron transfer, can easily be extended to a wide range of other similar objects studied in organic chemistry, for example, styryl dyes and charge-transfer complexes. Generalization to more complicated cases of quantum-classical transitions than electron transfer, due to the large cumbersomeness of the mathematical apparatus arising here, will require the collective efforts of the scientific community.</p>
