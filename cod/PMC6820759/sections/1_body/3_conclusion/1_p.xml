<p id="Par21">In this article, a series of CLSO:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> were synthesized by high temperature solid state method, and all as-synthesized phosphors are pure apatite structure and gravel-like morphology with particle size ranging 1–10 μm. In single doped CLSO:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors, the characteristic peaks of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> occur at 479 nm, 573 nm and 664 nm due to 
 <sup>4</sup>F
 <sub>9/2</sub> − 
 <sup>6</sup>H
 <sub>15/2</sub>, 
 <sup>4</sup>F
 <sub>9/2</sub> − 
 <sup>6</sup>H
 <sub>13/2</sub> and 
 <sup>4</sup>F
 <sub>9/2</sub> − 
 <sup>6</sup>H
 <sub>11/2</sub> transition, respectively. Moreover, Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> − Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> dipole-dipole interaction primarily contributes to emission quenching effect and quenching concentration at 0.20 Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> ion concentration. In co-doped CLSO:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors the luminescence spectra confirmed that existence of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> → Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> energy transfer phenomenon via quadrupole-quadrupole interaction with the critical distance 14.809 Å. Energy transfer efficiency can up to 74.72% with Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion doping concentration increasing. Decay curves reveal that Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> → Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> energy transfer result in lifetimes of 
 <sup>4</sup>F
 <sub>9/2</sub> level of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> having a sharp decrease, and it also occur a sharp lifetime decay of 
 <sup>4</sup>G
 <sub>5/2</sub> level of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> due to there may exists Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> ↔ Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> bilateral non-radiative energy transfer. Our CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> apatite phosphor exhibits cold white light emission with CIE chromaticity coordinate (0.309,0.309) and CCT 6848 K. In addition, CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor demonstrates excellent thermal stability and at 423 K emission intensity still is 92% of that at room temperature. These characteristics reveal CLSO:Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> can be a potential candidate for commercial w-LEDs devices.
