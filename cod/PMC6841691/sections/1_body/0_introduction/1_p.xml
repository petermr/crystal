<p id="Par2">The concept of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) was materialized by Yeh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. and Cantor 
 <italic>et al</italic>. around 15 years ago
 <sup>

 </sup>. In recent years they have gained popularity for their simplistic bcc or fcc type average structure and a wide range of exciting functional and engineering properties
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. HEAs are loosely defined as alloys containing 4 or more constituent elements with body-centred cubic (bcc) or face-centred cubic (fcc) type average structure in equiatomic or near-equiatomic ratio in various literature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Some of the very interesting properties that have been observed in HEAs are high strength and ductility at both ambient and high temperatures, which can be even better than many engineering materials like Ni-based Superalloys, Hastelloy and Stellite; hardness and wear resistance comparable to bearing and tool steels

 </sup>. Also other functional properties found in HEAs offer their potential use in diffusion barriers in microelectronics

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Researchers often associate the words concentrated solid solution alloys (CSSAs), multiprincipal element alloy (MPEA) and complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) with HEAs, but the HEAs have single-phase average structures which should not be confused with other multi-phase alloys

 </sup>. Due to their high configurational entropy, given as 
 <italic>Rln(n)</italic>, where 
 <italic>R</italic> is the universal gas constant, 
 <italic>n</italic> being the number of constituent elements; the entropic contribution to the Gibbs free energy of HEAs suppresses the formation of intermetallics and hence stabilises the solid-solution alloy

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Many of the promising superior properties as observed in the HEAs have been attributed to the distorted bulk lattice framework structure and low stacking fault energy

 </sup>. HEAs can be easily synthesized unlike conventional single principal element alloys, which usually have problems of complex microstructures resulting in brittleness, drop in strengthening at elevated temperature and long-term use in high temperature, precipitation of other intermetallic phases etc
