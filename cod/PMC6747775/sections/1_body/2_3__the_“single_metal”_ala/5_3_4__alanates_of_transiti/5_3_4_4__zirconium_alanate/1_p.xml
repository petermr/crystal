<p>The first report on Zr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> was the work of Reid et al. in 1957 [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Zr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> (7.49 wt.% hydrogen content) was produced by the metathesis reaction between Zr(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> and LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> in ether solution and He atmosphere [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Zr(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> was formerly prepared by metathesis of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> and ZrCl
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2008, Zr(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> was produced by the reaction between LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and ZrCl
 <sub>4</sub> in ether solution [
 <xref rid="B244-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. No clear indication of the reaction temperature was found in this work. No reports regarding the characteristics of dehydrogenation or on the characterization of this material were found. Other compositions of the Zr-Al-H system deserve further research; for example, Matsubara et al. achieved the hydrogenation of the intermetallic Zr
 <sub>3</sub>Al to give Zr
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B245-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>].
