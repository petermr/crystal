 </sub> as a function of positive 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub>, on a log-log plot. We observe that magnitudes of current in this regime are higher by more than one order of magnitude than those in negative 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime. At low 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub>, the carriers injected from one electrode redistribute themselves in such a way that they replace the holes flowing out at the other end. Hence charge transport is contact limited in which 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> is governed by the thermally generated free charge carriers in the device and varies linearly with 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> resulting in an ohmic region. At high bias, the injected carrier density becomes large resulting in accumulation of holes, which create a space charge region. The current then shows non-linear behavior with 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> consistent with space charge limited conduction (SCLC)

 </sup>. As expected, no saturation in current is observed because channel is not pinched-off in this regime and hence, no depletion region forms.
