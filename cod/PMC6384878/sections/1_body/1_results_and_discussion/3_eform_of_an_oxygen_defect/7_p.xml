<p id="Par18">Finally, we calculated the formation energies of antisites (atomic interchange, a pair of 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Y</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>Y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>X</italic>
 </sub>), which can be obtained by the differences in energies between supercells with and without antisites. The positions of the antisites were obtained by exchanging nearest-neighboring sites under the stoichiometric condition. The generated antisites were not very stable. For most of the antisites, the energies increased by more than 1 eV, as shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. When Fe and O were exchanged, the structure became unstable, so that it was optimized to a perfect crystal without antisites. The high formation energies of cation antisites are reasonable because the local environments of the three types of cation sites are different in the garnet crystal structure

 </sup>. Moreover, the formation energies of oxygen antisites were larger than 5 eV, which indicates that oxygen cannot be easily incorporated in cation sites.
