 <sub>2</sub>]:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, which was also used for STEM/EDX/ToF-SIMS-analysis, was synthesized by a solid-state reaction of Sr
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> (4.438 g, 15.26 mmol, Materion), AlN (1.261 g, 30.83 mmol, Tokuyama), Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (3.143 g, 30.83 mmol, Sinochem Hebei type C), Li
 <sub>3</sub>N (1.074 g, 30.83 mmol, Materion), and Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (0.081 g, 0.23 mmol, OSRAM). The starting materials were intimately mixed and placed inside of a Ni crucible. They were then heated in a tube furnace to 800 °C in a stream of 7.5% H
 <sub>2</sub> / N
 <sub>2</sub> and held at that temperature for 144 h. After the synthesis, the product was slightly inhomogeneous exhibiting small amounts of the side phases SrO and AlN. As SrO is not stable already at ambient conditions, it decomposes with time.
