 <caption> Snapshots of QRs in the thixotropic suspension at each step of the coating process: a) gel with random networks, b) sheared sol where the networks break down, c) gel with aligned networks after shear, and d) aligned film after solvent evaporation. e) Schematic illustration of the fabrication of aligned QR‐based thin films by the blade‐coating process. f) Thixotropic behavior of the LaPO 4 QR gel suspension: top, gel; middle, sol after stirring; bottom, gel after setting the sol inclined. g) SEM image of the LaPO 4 QRs (the scale bar indicates 200 nm). h) High resolution transmission electron microscopy image and its fast‐Fourier‐transform (FFT, inset) of a single crystalline LaPO 4 QR.
