<p id="Par36">At 49.3(8) GPa, we collected 1524 reflections in total, which were merged based upon identical indices to 968 independent reflections with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>int</sub> = 3.97%. At 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.8 Å, completeness of the data was 36.6%. The amount of the collected data allowed us to refine the thermal parameters of all atoms in an isotropic approximation. The resulting ratio between data (968) and the number of parameters (97) was ~10. Nine reflections were omitted from the refinement due to overlap with diamond. The final structure was refined to convergence with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 7.59%, 
 <italic>wR</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 17.40%, and GOF = 1.124 for all 968 unique reflections [
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 6.28%, 
 <italic>wR</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 16.35%, for those 798 data with 
 <italic>I</italic> &gt; 2σ(
 <italic>I</italic>)]. On a final difference Fourier map, we observed no peaks higher than 0.8 e·Å
 <sup>−2</sup>. The most of the intense peaks were within 1 Å of the Si atoms. Values of thermal parameters of all atoms are within the normal interval (0.011–0.016 A
