<p>The formation of the 14 membered macrocycle, 2,9-dioxo-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-4,7-cyclotetradecanediacetic acid, abbreviated as H
 <sub>2</sub>L14, was confirmed by the X-ray analysis, in addition to the previous studies of the Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> complex. The Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complexes were characterized by spectroscopies, and the chelate molecules [ML14Â·H
 <sub>2</sub>O] were confirmed, by DFT calculations, to have hexa-coordinated octahedral geometries with a close resemblance to the Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> complex molecule in the bond lengths and angles. Among the metallic complexes and the uncoordinated receptor, the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complex was capable of deactivating the synthetic free radicals ABTS and DPPH, with a moderate activity in reference to well-established antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and glutathione.
