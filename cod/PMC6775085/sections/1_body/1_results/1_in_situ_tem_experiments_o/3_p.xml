<p id="Par8">After heating up the aluminum to 400 °C, a cold tip was manipulated to touch the hot surface of aluminum and then pulled up slowly. A small bump on the substrate was chosen to be the initial contact site, as it allows easy observation of the subsequent mass transport: the mass in the bump was sucked up, as indicated by the recession of its profile from Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>. After 520 s, a rough nanowire 1.5 μm in length and 100 nm in diameter was formed. This nanowire consists of several segments, with dents on the surface and GBs inside the wire. This polycrystalline growth is because the positioning system used here could move stably only across a small distance of a few hundred nanometers. The nanowire growth is easily perturbed by vibrations or lateral drift, causing the change of growth direction or surface roughness.
