<p>As observed for the experiments conducted with only LiBr and Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, precipitation occurred within the first 3 min after the addition of the carbonate solution for the experiments with 1 M KCl solution. However, in the presence of 1 M NaCl nucleation only occurred after six minutes. Bulk analysis of the precipitates using DRIFTS and XRD demonstrated that zabuyelite was also formed in these experiments (

 </xref>a). Similarly, SEM imaging of the precipitates shows that the crystals expressed a very similar prismatic crystal morphology (

 </xref>c,d) to the experiments without additional ions and are also found as rosettes. However, measurements of crystal aspect components indicate that the {010} forms are enlarged in the presence of NaCl and KCl. This occurred at the expense of {110} form width in comparison to crystals grown in solutions containing only LiBr and Na

 </xref>). In addition, the average length of the crystals increased to 15 μm. Raman spectroscopic analysis showed spectral bands at the same positions as those detected in the LiBr with Na

 <sub>3</sub> experiments. No difference in the FWHM (8.7 ± 0.2 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) of the most intense Raman band at 1093 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> was observed between experiments with and without high concentrations of the monovalent cation chloride salts, implying that the crystals had a similar crystallinity.
