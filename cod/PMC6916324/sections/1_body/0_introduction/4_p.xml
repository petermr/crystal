<p>Single‐crystal structural analyses based on the independent‐atom model only provide the positions of the centroids of the atoms and the distances between the atoms. In contrast, the multipole model from high‐resolution data provides physically meaningful properties far beyond simple geometrical considerations. In this paper we investigate the ED in catalytically active cobalt orthophosphate Co

Not only the bonding is studied but also the ED distribution at the two different metal sites is determined and linked to various substrates.
