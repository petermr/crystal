<p>The following conclusions can be drawn from the coordinate comparison and error comparison. The UWB positioning system has poor positioning stability and low positioning accuracy. Especially when the number of indoor people or things increases, the accuracy is further reduced. When it is used independently, it is difficult to provide reliable coordinate data for the delivery robot. The improved odometer positioning method has better positioning results, and the error of the start-up phase of the delivery robot is also smaller. However, with time, the cumulative error increases. Thus, the final positioning accuracy decreases. The stability and accuracy of the positioning coordinates after fusion by the EKF fusion algorithm are improved considerably compared to the independent use of the first two methods. In particular, the positioning error of the fused coordinates is less than 15 cm.</p>
