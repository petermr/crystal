 <caption> ( a) ( k x , k y ) momentum distribution at E F of valence-band photoelectrons from Mo(110) at hν = 3.100 keV and ( b) corresponding ToF spectrum taken from the dashed circle in ( a). ( c) ( k x , k y ) section of the same data set at a binding energy of 3.2 eV, where the 2 s/2 p core-level signals (bright circle) originating from a third-order admixture ( hν = 9.3 keV) incidentally coincide in time with the valence-band pattern. ( d) ( k x , E B) section along the dashed line in ( c); ( e) corresponding ToF spectrum taken in the white circle in ( c). The E B scale in ( e) corresponds to the valence band (VB); the core-level electrons are much faster. ( f) Temporal aliasing effect. Scheme of the energy intervals corresponding to the ‘true’ photoelectrons (10 eV intervals marked) and electrons which are slower or faster by one or two periods of the photon pulses ( T) for drift energies of 34, 54 and 74 eV. The values correspond to the 80-bunch filling pattern of PETRA III ( T = 96 ns; see text for details). Dots denote the Fermi edge of the true signal and the corresponding upper edges of the nT-bands. ( g) Survey ToF spectrum (hence the non-linear energy scale) of a GaIn(3%)Mn(2.5%)As sample, recorded in static mode without scanning. </caption>
