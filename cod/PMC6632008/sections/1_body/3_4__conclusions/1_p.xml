<p>In the present work, we have designed a novel cathode material by partially replacing Sr by Ba in SrCo
 <sub>0.95</sub>Ru
 <sub>0.05</sub>O
 <sub>3−δ</sub> perovskite. We have shown with an NPD study that this compound is stabilized in a tetragonal perovskite structure at RT, defined in the P4/mmm group, with an expanded unit-cell volume with respect to the parent compound. The tetragonal superstructure is due to the long-range ordering of oxygen vacancies along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. The 
 <italic>dc</italic> conductivity seems to be sufficient for a good performance as cathode material in SOFC. A good chemical compatibility was observed with the LSGM electrolyte for 12 h. The TEC of this material is higher than those usually presented in the other cell components, but it is characteristic of perovskites that contain Co. Interestingly, an EIS investigation unveils a lower polarization resistance than the parent compound, together with a reasonable total conductivity. All these properties make this material a good cathode candidate for solid oxide fuel cells performing at intermediate temperatures (IT-SOFC).
