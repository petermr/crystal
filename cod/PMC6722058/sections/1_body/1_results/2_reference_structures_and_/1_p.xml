For Ag–S and Ag–P interfaces, 17 known thiolate and/or phosphine-protected silver nanoclusters were included in the set of reference structures. The reference silver nanoclusters have 14–374 Ag-atoms and 20–117 ligands including thiolates, phosphines, diphosphines and halides. A complete list of the reference structures is given in Supplementary Tables

 </sup>, removing the ligand layer including sulfurs, by building a large number of potential structures of the ligand layer around the fixed gold core, ranking the structures, and comparing these Au–S interface structures with the experimental crystal structure. Validation in the case of Ag–S interfaces was done with four protected Ag-clusters in the size range of 23–211 Ag-atoms and 26–78 ligands

 </sup>. Two of these clusters had ligand layers consisting of both thiolates and phosphines, and one consisting of thiolates and diphosphines. Combined, the selected Au- and Ag-clusters include various different symmetries, cluster sizes, surface curvatures, surface morphologies, and protecting ligand motifs. Table
