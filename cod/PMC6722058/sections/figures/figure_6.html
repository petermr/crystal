 <caption> Determination of the true structure of Ag-clusters using CSE ranking. Ratio of correctly predicted S-atoms as a function of CSE for ligand-protected Ag-clusters: a Ag 23(SR) 18(PPh 3) 8, b Ag 44(SR) 30, c Ag 78(SR) 42(DPPP) 6, and d Ag 211Cl(SR) 71(PPh 3) 6. CSE includes contributions from error of local environments of Ag and S atoms as well as from the number of predicted S atoms in units and in total </caption>
