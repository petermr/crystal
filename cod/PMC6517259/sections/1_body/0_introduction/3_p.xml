<p id="p0035">In this study, we explore the possibility of using a racemic glassy organic film composed of enantiomers, for the phase stability control of the HTL in PSCs. As a proof of concept, we design a low-molecule-symmetry helicene-based organic semiconductor,

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). O5H-OMeDPA consists of an oxa-[5]helicene core and two electron-donating bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine segments (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Nakahara et al., 2013</xref>), oxa-[5]helicene itself distorts with a 25° torsion angle of the two outer benzene rings in single crystal. The slight torsion configuration reduces the molecular symmetry (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2018</xref>) may enhance the hole mobility. Our preliminary studies have shown that PSCs with O5H-OMeDPA as HTL present a high PCE of 21.03% and good stability under continuous full-sunlight soaking at 60°C.
