<p id="Par2">Microstructural features in ionic ceramics have great influence on the ionic conductivities of such materials, which are tightly related to the mass transport of ions

 </sup>. These microstructural features include interfaces, grain-boundaries, and dislocations. Among these microstructural features, dislocations are not only isolated defects themselves, but can also form the basic structural unit of other microstructural features such as low angle grain-boundaries

 </sup>. In addition, defect-dislocation interactions can also have important impact on the plasticity of materials. Thus, understanding the effect of dislocations on mass transport in ionic ceramics is important for understanding the behavior of these materials in a variety of contexts.
