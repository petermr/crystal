<p>At the present conditions of chain architecture, compositions, and segregation strength, the three new morphologies are metastable. However, it was reported by Matsen [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and later by Escobedo et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] that double diamonds can be stabilized over double gyroids by blending with the homopolymers of the minor component through the relief of packing frustration. Shi and co-workers also suggested a different tactic to stabilize complex morphologies by blending two AB diblock copolymers of different sizes, or in other words making the bidisperse blends of AB copolymers [
 <xref rid="B48-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is therefore the topic of our future study to pursue such blending technique to find the condition where our new morphologies can be stabilized, especially targeting where double diamonds are stable. It is necessary to perform an extensive and thorough investigation into the vastly extended parameter space including the ratio of homopolymer size to copolymer size and homopolymer compositions.
