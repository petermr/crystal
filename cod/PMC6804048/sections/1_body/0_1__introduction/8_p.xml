<p>The Nb–Sn–Si and Ti–Sn–Si ternary phase diagrams have been reported by Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Bulanova et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], respectively. In both ternary systems the existence of a ternary W
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub> type compound has been reported, those being the Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si and Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si for the Nb–Sn–Si and Ti–Sn–Si systems, respectively. The stability of the latter compound was confirmed by Colinet and Tedenac [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The first report of the Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si compound was by Horyn and Lukaszewicz [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pietzka and Schuster [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] prepared several ternary alloys with a T:M:Al ratio of 5:2:1 where T = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W, and M = Si, Ge, Sn and Pb. The Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al and Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al phases had the same structure. In these phases the T atoms (T = Nb and Ti) occupy the 4b and 16k Wyckoff positions, the Al and Si atoms the 4a positions and the Sn atoms the 8h positions [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently the authors reported on the stability of Nb
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Si in an experimental study of alloys of the Nb–Al–Sn system [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The crystal structure for the ternary
