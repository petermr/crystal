<p>Several zabuyelite surface terminations were examined for the (001), (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01), and (110) surfaces to determine the most stable atomic configurations (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>
 </xref>). For all three surfaces, the most stable plane of bulk zabuyelite reduces the originally tetrahedrally coordinated Li ions to 3-fold coordination. The stability order of the zabuyelite surfaces in dry conditions was calculated to be (001) &gt; (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) &gt; (110). Water adsorption lowered the energy of the system (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>) and thus produced more stable surfaces than those observed in vacuo due to a similar Li coordination to that observed in the bulk structure (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>). This behavior has been found previously in calculations of hydrated, relaxed surfaces on calcite, where oxygen atom of the water molecules coordinates to the surface calcium, stabilizing the surface.

 </sup> Relaxation of the hydrated surface led to a reversal of the stability order: (110) &gt; (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01) &gt; (001). Wulff constructed equilibrium morphologies of the entire crystal based on the calculated surface energies predicts that zabuyelite in a vacuum has a broad, plate-like structure with equal contributions from the (001), (
 <span class="overline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</span>01), and (110) surfaces in agreement with previous computational work using ab initio modeling.

 </sup> However, the equilibrium morphology expected for hydrated surfaces is very similar to the prismatic crystal observed in the experiments (c.f.,

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b and 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) indicating a good representation of surface stability is provided by the simulations.
