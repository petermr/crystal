<p>In summary, an effective and robust wind speed sensor is fabricated by integrating a wind‐driven TIEL component and a perovskite‐based PD for the first time. It shows a low detection limit (5 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>), high output current (≈mA), and rapid response (&lt;0.3 s). Moreover, the sensing performance of this device is significantly superior to the existing TENG‐based wind speed sensor and is also comparable with a commercial sensor. Therefore, this study presents a key step for the practical application of new environmental‐friendly light source and the sensor systems related to TIEL.
