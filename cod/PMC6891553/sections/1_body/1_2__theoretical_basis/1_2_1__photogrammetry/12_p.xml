<p>(v) Reconstruction of the surface and texturing: Finally, and starting from the dense cloud of the points obtained, a three-dimensional mesh is made using triangles [
 <xref rid="B37-sensors-19-04881" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which will be provided with the tonality that defines the photographic image for that area [
 <xref rid="B38-sensors-19-04881" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], obtaining realistic three-dimensional models (see an example in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f002">Figure 2</xref>g).
