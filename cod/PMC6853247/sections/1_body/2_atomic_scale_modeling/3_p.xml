<p>At ambient pressure, the lattice parameters for the pure Mg end‐member of the Anh‐B (Mg
 <sub>14</sub>Si
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>24</sub> with 86 atoms in the unit cell) are 0.591, 1.429, and 1.014 nm. At 15 GPa, the lattice parameters are 0.574, 1.394, and 0.983 nm. The pressure‐volume calculations were fitted to a third‐order Birch‐Murnaghan EOS to yield
