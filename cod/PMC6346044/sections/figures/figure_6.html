 <caption> Number of samples in each of the two EM clusters obtained from the dataset belonging to ( a) the amorphous class and ( b) the liquid class. The temperature region 130–170 K in ( a) was identified as estimate of the supercooled liquid transition to an amorphous solid where the volume has arrested its decrease. The temperature region 220–300 K in ( b) was identified as an estimate for the melting transition. </caption>
