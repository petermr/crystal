<p>The reports on Mn(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> are rather diffuse, as in the case of Be(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>. The first compilation where Mn(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> appeared, is the book of Mackay [
 <xref rid="B187-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. In that book, Mn(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> was reported to be prepared from a halide complex (no mention of which halide) and LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> in Et
 <sub>2</sub>O, and to decompose at 25 Â°C. The book refers, in turn, to two reports of Monnier et al. [
 <xref rid="B247-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>,
 <xref rid="B248-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. No further reports on Mn(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> were found. Mn(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> would have a hydrogen content of 6.89 wt.%.
