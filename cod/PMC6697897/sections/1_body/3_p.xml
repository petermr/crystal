<p>Recent studies also suggested that under high-pressure conditions methane and water could form stoichiometric mixed molecular crystals beyond the known MH-III phase: The existence of a new high-pressure phase in methane hydrate at pressures beyond 40 to 50 GPa was first hinted by Hirai and coworkers (

The high-pressure structure was observed to survive up to 86 GPa, but the diffraction patterns did not allow the authors to identify it in detail.
