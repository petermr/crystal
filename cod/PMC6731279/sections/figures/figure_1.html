 <caption> Growth and structural characterizations of two types of interfaces between CaHfO 3 (CHO) and SrTiO 3 (STO). a, b Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) intensity oscillations of the specular reflected beam for the growth of CHO directly on TiO 2-terminated STO (T-STO), and after a monolayer of SrO was deposited on the T-STO, namely SrO-terminated STO (S-STO), respectively. Insets show the schematics of the two structures. c, d Atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface morphologies of 8 uc CHO grown on T-STO and S-STO, respectively. The size of both images is 1 μm × 2 μm. e, f X-ray diffraction (XRD) finite-thickness oscillations in the vicinity of the (001) reflection for 20 uc CHO grown on T-STO and S-STO, respectively. g, h Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of 8 uc CHO grown on T-STO and S-STO, respectively. i, j The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of the same samples from g, h, respectively </caption>
