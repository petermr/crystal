 <bold>High‐resolution structure determination</bold>: Cobalt orthophosphate was purchased as powder from Alfa Aesar. Given that it is not soluble in any conventional organic solvents, it was crystallized from the melt. The solid was heated to 1180 °C under air atmosphere in a chamber oven, then cooled to 500 °C, tempered for one hour and finally cooled down to room temperature. The crystallization approach known from the Ref.

A violet single crystal of 45×90×100 μm in size was mounted at room temperature on the goniometer using inert perfluorinated polyether oil and cooled to 100 K.
