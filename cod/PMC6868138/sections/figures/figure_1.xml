  <p>Spiral droplets reorient their swim in response to light-induced helix inversion. The molecular chirality of motor 
   <bold>m</bold> and its light-induced isomer 
   <bold>m</bold>* is transmitted across increasing length scales, from a chiral center in the motor, to the helical shape of the motor and eventually to liquid crystal chirality (left-handed in red, right-handed in blue). In spherical confinement and with the liquid crystal molecules aligning perpendicularly to the interface, a double spiral disclination line forms at the surface of the droplet. This disclination line is visible under polarized optical microscopy (scale bar 50 μm) and is also shown in the model of the droplet (red for left-handed and blue for right-handed). These chiral droplets are propelled along helical trajectories with a handedness that is opposite to that of the droplets. Upon illumination, the molecular motors invert the handedness of their helical shape, in a process that drives their rotation and leads to inversion of liquid crystal handedness. This light-induced inversion is associated with inversion of the helical trajectory and with a deterministic reorientation
