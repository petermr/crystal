 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors with Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration ranging from 1% to 100% were synthesized by solid state reaction method at relatively low temperatures. All samples showed bright red luminescence if excited with near-UV radiation. The most intensive emission lines of Eu

 <sub>4</sub> transitions at 615 and 702 nm, respectively. The calculated colour coordinates also indicated high colour purity of the emission regardless the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration and temperature. Samples, excited at 393.5 nm possessed high quantum efficiency reaching almost 100% for 50% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> doped specimen. Moreover, these phosphors also showed high emission stability at elevated temperatures. The extrapolation of experimental results indicated that synthesized phosphors would lose half of efficiency only at 716 K what is well beyond the operating temperature of high power LED semiconductor chip. The calculated luminous efficacies were comparable or even superior to those reported for well-established Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doped phosphors. All these properties of herein reported Rb

 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors makes them good candidates for practical application as a red component in a near-UV LED driven solid state light sources. However, it should also be noted that the most efficient samples possess high concentration of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> which makes these phosphors relatively expensive. Moreover, these phosphors could also be considered for application in luminescent security pigments due to unique emission spectra.
