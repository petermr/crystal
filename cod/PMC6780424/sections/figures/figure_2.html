 <caption> Shock dynamics of the ( a) Îµ-CL-20 crystal, ( b) CL-20/HMX cocrystal, ( c) CL-20/TNT cocrystal, ( d) CL-20/NMP/H 2O cocrystal and ( e) TATB crystal. In each panel, the temperature and pressure are shown as a function of time. The molecular conformations at the beginning of each decomposition reaction are also plotted. </caption>
