 <sup>3+</sup>, CLSO:0.20Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>/0.20Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors. As observed, there are similar XRD patterns for the CLSO host and doped samples. And no impurity phase peaks appear, which indicates that rare earth ions substitute the host lattice causing little changes in crystal structure, due to ion radii of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> (r = 0.97 Å for CN = 7 and r = 1.08 Å for CN = 9)and Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> (r = 1.02 Å for CN = 7 and r = 1.13 Å for CN = 9)are close to that of La
 <sup>3+</sup> (r = 1.10 Å for CN = 7 and r = 1.22 Å for CN = 9)of the CLSO host

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, demonstrate all samples belonging to hexagonal apatite structure and space group P6
 <sub>3</sub>/m. The calculated values of CLSO host are little different from that JCPDS No.29-0337 given, and as RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions doped there is an irregular decrease in cell parameter and unit cell volume (more cell parameters see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), owing to in theoretical prediction impurity Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> or Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions should only occupy La
 <sup>3+</sup> ions lattice resulting in a regular decrease as impurity RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions concentration increases in CLSO host crystal structure, but the actual situation exists some difference with theories. During the synthesis process, thermal diffusion being a stochastic and uncontrollable process, though ion radius of Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> or Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> is close to that of La
 <sup>3+</sup> and more suitable to substitute La
 <sup>3+</sup>, there still a few part of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> are replaced by impurity ions and will generate a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> vacancy when an impurity RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ion with +3 charges occupies a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ion lattice point with +2 charges, bringing about irregular lattice distortion.
