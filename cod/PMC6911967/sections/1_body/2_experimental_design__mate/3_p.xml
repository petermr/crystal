 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the present calculations, the polarized double-ζ functions (DZP) were assigned for all species. This means two sets of s- and p-orbitals plus one set of d-orbitals on silicon atoms, and two sets of s-orbitals plus a set of p-orbitals on hydrogen atoms. The electron density and potential terms were calculated on a real space grid with the spacing equivalent to a plane-wave cut-off of 200 Ry. The calculations were performed using 6 layers thick slabs (7 layer slabs for the (16 × 2) reconstruction) terminated by hydrogen from one side. A 18 Å thick vacuum layer was used. We used specific k-point grids for each surface reconstruction/slab, depending on its respective lateral dimensions, namely: 2 × 2 × 1 for (1 1 0)-(5 × 8) and
