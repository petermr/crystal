 <caption> (Top row) Ground-state geometries of three GaCl 3–phosphine complexes obtained from DFT calculations (see below): (a) GaCl 3 complexed with triethylphosphine, used as model for GaCl 3 complexed with trioctylphosphine (GaCl 3–TOP), (b) GaCl 3 complexed with triphenylphosphite (GaCl 3–TPP), and (c) GaCl 3 complexed with diphenylphosphine (GaCl 3–DPP). (Middle row) TEM images of product NCs obtained after reaction of Cu 2– x S NCs with (d) GaCl 3–TOP at 100 °C, (e) GaCl 3–TPP at 100 °C, and (f) GaCl 3–DPP at 50 °C. Black arrows indicate intraparticle contrast in the NCs reacted with GaCl 3–TPP. Top-right insets show the corresponding ED patterns. Bottom row (g–i) shows the corresponding azimuthally integrated ED patterns. Reference bars in (h,i) are calculated patterns based on the wurtzite CuGaS 2 crystals structure, 44 and reference bars in (g) are based on the low-chalcocite Cu 2– x S crystal structure. 34 </caption>
