<p id="Par9">As a natural consequence of the tetragonal crystal structure, the pseudogap phase with 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> symmetry is expected to form domains with different preferred directions in the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane. The observation of a nonzero 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub> indicates a domain number imbalance. We note that although the magnitude of 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub> for the three crystals is of the same order, 2
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub> for 
 <italic>p</italic> ≈ 0.12 is a few times larger than for 
 <italic>p</italic> ≈ 0.11 and 0.125. The torque curves remain unchanged for field-cooling conditions at different field angles. To check the influence of the strain on the side of the crystal attached to the cantilever, we measured the torque after remounting the crystal rotated by 90 ° (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a, b</xref>). The direction of the nematicity is unchanged relative to the crystal axes after the crystal rotation. Although the magnitude of 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub> is enhanced, possibly due to a change in the imbalance of the number of the domains, the temperature dependence of 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) is essentially the same in a wide temperature range below 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>*</sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). This implies that a large fraction of the domains are pinned by the underlying crystal conditions, such as internal stress, disorder and crystal shape, which may be consistent with the absence of hysteresis and thermal history effects. It also suggests that uniaxial pressure may reverse the direction of the nematicity. We note that a somewhat analogous situation is encountered in polar Kerr-effect measurements on YBCO, where the sign of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is fixed at temperatures significantly above 
 <italic>T</italic>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. We point out that these chains are not relevant to the observed nematicity, because the direction of the chains is along [100]/[010], while the direction of the nematicity is along [110]. Moreover, the chains are quite stable and form at high temperature, well above 
 <italic>T</italic>
