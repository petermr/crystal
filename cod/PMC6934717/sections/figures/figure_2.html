 <caption> Tetragonal (0 2 0) peak profiles for the two EuFe 2As 2 crystals at room temperature for ( a) ‘crystal a’ and ( b) ‘crystal b’, showing the peak false color maps, and their corresponding peak intensity profiles along the crystallographic c direction. Note the difference in scales on both axes. The peak from ‘crystal a’ is substantially broadened showing extended diffuse lines. </caption>
