<p>Synthesis highlights in this work are that subtle changes in the rigid organo‐cation (SDA) stereochemistry can lead to entirely different zeolite (host lattice) structures as the framework develops around the guest molecule. In turn, as we continue to increase our database of known zeolite structures, and understand the spatial orientation of the guest SDA molecules in the lattice, our ability to create new pairings improves. That is, we can predict what type of host environment can accommodate the guest and in which orientation. Molecular modelling of the type seen herein can be used effectively to check on the feasibility of the orientation of the SDA in a prospective lattice. In addition, our understanding of how the inorganic conditions of a zeolite synthesis bias the potential for specific sub‐units in the developing structure provide another parameter in model building for creating space for a guest. The resurgence of discoveries related to ABC‐6 zeolites, small‐pore products with larger cages that host the organo‐cations, are a good example. The SSZ‐27 zeolite, rich in 5‐ and 6‐ring subunits (which typically requires a higher Si/Al synthesis regime) is found to have a good spatial consistency with one particular SDA isomer, and then yields a highly unusual framework structure.</p>
