<p>To highlight the differences between olivine ELNES structures (where silicon atoms are all in tetrahedral sites) and the ELNES structures of the phase in the lamella (where we suppose the occurrence of silicon atoms in octahedral sites), we have analyzed the “olivine//lamella” differential EELS spectra. The estimated thicknesses indicated in parenthesis on Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> have been obtained by comparing energy‐filtered intensities to keep only the elastic electrons, with raw intensities, thanks to the following equation extracted from the Poisson law:
