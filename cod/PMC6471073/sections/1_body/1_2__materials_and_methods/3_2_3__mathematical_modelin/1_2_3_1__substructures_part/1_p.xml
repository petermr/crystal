<p>Based on the periodic characteristic of the DRG sensing structure, the adjacent two rings and the interconnected 8 spokes can be partitioned to the first level (level-1) substructures, while the single ring and spoke can be seen as the second level (level-2) substructures, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f002">Figure 2</xref>. While there are n-1 level-1 substructures in a DRG with n rings, there are 10 level-2 substructures (inner rings, outer rings, and spoke A-H) in a level-1 substructure. As the spokes of adjacent layers are alternately arranged, the level-1 substructures can be divided into two types: type I, in which spoke A is located at −22.5°, and type II, in which spoke A is located at 0°.
