<p>In this work, we present a structural and biochemical analysis of the 2′-dG-II class of riboswitches that explains its selectivity for 2′-dG over other purine nucleobases and nucleosides. While the global architecture of the 2′-dG-II riboswitch aptamer domain is highly similar to the other classes within the purine riboswitch family, there are significant differences around the ligand binding pocket between the two 2′-dG classes. Notably, the two-nucleotide insertion element in J3/1 enables base-base interactions not observed in the other purine classes. Analysis of a series of mutants indicates that while the J3/1 insertion element and the identity of the junction-proximal base pair in P1 play a central role in promoting 2′-dG affinity, other nucleotides within the junction also contribute towards achieving high affinity binding. Binding analysis of a subset of aptamers from the 2′-dG-II family revealed a spectrum of selectivities for 2′-dG versus 2′-rG, suggesting that some members may respond to both nucleosides, further highlighting potential hidden variation within bioinformatically-defined riboswitch classes.</p>
