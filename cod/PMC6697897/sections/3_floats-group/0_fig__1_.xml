   <sub>2</sub>O stretching modes, the lattice mode, and the MH-IV characteristic modes (IV modes). (
   <italic>Inset</italic>) Experimental Raman spectra showing the IV modes appearing beyond 100 GPa. Theoretical frequency values were computed through the velocity time correlation functions as extracted from AIMD trajectories, with the only exception of D
   <sub>2</sub>O stretching modes, which were calculated in the harmonic crystal framework.
