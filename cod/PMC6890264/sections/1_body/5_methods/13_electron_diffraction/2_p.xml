 </sub>S NCs and the particles obtained after reaction of these parent NCs with cation exchange precursors was performed as follows: measured two-dimensional patterns were reduced to one dimension by azimuthal integration of the patterns around the center, which was manually defined for every pattern. The measured ED patterns were calibrated to a gold reference sample (Agar S106). The calibration procedure is described in detail in the
