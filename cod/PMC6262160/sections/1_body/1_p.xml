   <p id="p0025">The data illustrates the advantage of using the quadrupole configurations for the construction of dislocations with an edge component when the periodic boundary conditions are used. The advantage manifests itself as much smaller deviations from the perfect crystalline structure, compared to the other methods of dislocations construction, at the boundaries of the periodic images.</p>
