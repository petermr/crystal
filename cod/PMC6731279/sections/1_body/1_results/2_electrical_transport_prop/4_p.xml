<p id="Par10">Besides its robustness to the annealing in oxygen, the presently observed EG of CHO/STO shows a few other interesting features. First, the CHO/S-STO generally has even better electrical transport properties than the CHO/T-STO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Second, the electron mobility of CHO/STO is high. As shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, for the metallic CHO/STO, the residual resistivity ratio (
