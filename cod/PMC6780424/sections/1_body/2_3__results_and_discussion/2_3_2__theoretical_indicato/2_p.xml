<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, there was a satisfactory agreement between the 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> and the 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>50%</sub> values derived from the same experiment. For example, in experiment 1, BTF had the highest sensitivity with 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>50%</sub> = 50 cm, and TATB had the lowest sensitivity with 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>50%</sub> &gt; 320 cm. Correspondingly, BTF had the shortest delay of shock reaction at 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> = 103.6 fs, while TATB had the longest delay with 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> &gt; 1000.0 fs. In experiment 2, the sensitivity order characterized by 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>50%</sub> was ε-CL-20 &gt; CL-20/H
 <sub>2</sub>O &gt; CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Correspondingly, the sensitivity order quantified by 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> was exactly the same, which was 145.8 fs for ε-CL-20, 174.4 fs for CL-20/H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 204.3 fs for CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O. In experiments 3 and 4, the 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>50%</sub> for ε-CL-20 was less than those for CL-20/HMX and CL-20/TNT. Consistent with this, 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> = 145.8 fs for ε-CL-20 was also smaller than 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> = 156.9 fs for CL-20/HMX and 
 <italic>t
  <sub>initiation</sub>
 </italic> = 181.8 fs for CL-20/HMX.
