<p>Alkaline earth silicate and aluminate are favorable host materials. The development and research of rare-earth ion sensitized aluminate and silicate materials has been the principal part of long persistent luminescence materials in the recent years.

 </sup> Aluminosilicate is also a good luminescent matrix with advantages such as stable chemical property, low synthesis temperature, abundant raw material, and low cost. Therefore, aluminosilicate has great value in research and application as a novel long persistent luminescence matrix. The structure of aluminosilicate is complicated, with a wide variety of phase compositions. Thus, it is difficult to prepare a single pure phase. The complex crystal structure of aluminosilicate can create multiple lattice environments for doped rare-earth ions, which can generate different luminescence centers, therefore obtaining a unique luminescence property.
