<p>The 2′-deoxyguanosine sugar is recognized by extensive interactions with the pocket formed by J2/3 and P1. As described above, the furan oxygen (O4′) forms two hydrogen bonding interactions with N2 of G21 and N4 of C50 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The 3′-OH of the ligand is recognized by the 2′-OH of U49, similar to what is observed in 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I). Finally, the 5′-OH of the ligand hydrogen bonds with N3 of G21 and likely N4 of C48. This latter hydrogen bonding interaction is slightly longer at 3.6 Å, but can still be productive. Within the 2′-dG-II class, residue 48 is often adenosine which could also position a hydrogen bond donating amine adjacent to the 5′-OH of 2′-dG. This substitution in 
 <italic>env1</italic>(C48A) results in a 4.8-fold increase in binding affinity, strongly suggesting that this interaction contributes to binding affinity in other members of the 2′-dG-II class. Remarkably, the binding affinity for 
 <italic>env1</italic>(C48A) is nearly identical that of the 
 <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> riboswitch aptamer for guanine (7 and 5 nM, respectively) and displays a &gt;25-fold higher affinity for 2′-dG than 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I) (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These data indicate that a subset of class II 2′-dG riboswitches have an additional set of interactions that result in significantly higher affinity for their cognate ligand as compared to their 2′-dG-I counterparts.
