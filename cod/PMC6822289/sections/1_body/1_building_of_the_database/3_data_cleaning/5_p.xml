<p>It is instructive to discuss a few examples of this detection and correction of typos. In three cases the DFT calculation failed, and from visual inspection we observed unphysical bond lengths. The problem was fixed by keeping the same fractional coordinates for the atoms and rescaling the unit cell dimension to obtain physical Câ€“C bonds in benzene rings (see COFs 18021N3, 18121N3, and 18122N3).

 </sup> We see this as an example of a reasonable but ad-hoc fix, which might be challenged in the future. In another case, a significant change in the unit cell was found after optimization, and this was caused by a manual error in the parsing from the SI: the COF with ID 120 in the database of Tong et al.
