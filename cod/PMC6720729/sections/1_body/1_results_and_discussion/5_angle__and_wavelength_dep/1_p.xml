<p>To evaluate the potential application of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> as a photoelectric sensor we also performed another angle-resolved photoelectric measurement. In this test, we first fixed the incident wavelength at 633 nm and the power at 1.4 mW. Then a strategy comparable with the above-mentioned electronic test was performed to get the angle-resolved photocurrent with bias voltage of 5 mV. The real-time response curves are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, in which a more distinct photoelectric effect can be observed under the daylight illumination using a household lamp. Meanwhile, a rapid increase and decrease in current reached the saturation value and the minimum value within about 200 ms, achieved by switching the laser on and off. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> shows the magnified change of the 60° photocurrent curve achieved by changing the laser state from off to on. Due to the more abundant laser-generated carriers, distinguishable fluctuations of the current values were obtained when the test angles of TE/RE pairs were varied from 0° to 150°. More detailed observations of the photosensitivity yield (

 <sub>2</sub>, but also it means a potential application for an angle-dependent photodetector is promising.
