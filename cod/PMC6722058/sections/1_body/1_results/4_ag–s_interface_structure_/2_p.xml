<p id="Par20">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the results from prediction for all four systems. The success of the prediction varies from 0.022 to 42.9%. To remark, the success ratio increased from 0 to 0.85% for the largest cluster Ag
 <sub>211</sub> from the first to the second prediction run. The maximum number of ligands found in protecting units and in total are in a very good agreement with the molecular compositions of the true structures for all systems. The minimum RMSD values of the correct structures are in a range of 0.225–0.744 Å and the corresponding structures are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The Ag–S interfaces are more complex than Au–S interfaces especially in larger clusters which can be seen as a more significant variations in the positions of the sulfur atoms compared to the true structure and also in the success rates and the RMSD values.
