<p id="Par28">Hardening is implemented in the CPFE formulation as a function of evolving GND density (Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>)). For the implanted sample, the hardening is accompanied by a strain softening due to removal of helium-implantation-induced defects by glide dislocations (Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>)). The fine-tuned combination of hardening and softening in the UMAT is vital for the quantitative agreement observed between the CPFE predictions and experimental results for the lattice distortions. The explicit incorporation of GNDs in the formulation is key for introducing length-scale effects as originally proposed by Ashby

 </sup>. Further, the GND distribution can provide insights into the plastic zone size, which can be directly compared to experiments. Following Nyeâ€™s theory

 </sup>, GND densities are thus computed from both HR-EBSD and Laue measurements and compared with the CPFE predictions.
