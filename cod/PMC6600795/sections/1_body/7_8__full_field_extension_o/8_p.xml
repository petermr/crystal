<p>The level lines of derivative ∂u
 <sub>e1</sub>/∂e
 <sub>1</sub> are almost constant in the field of view. Looking at 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f013">Figure 13</xref> and making a correlation between the image and the derivative plots, it is possible to visualize the connection between the rosette approach that was analyzed before and the fringe pattern approach. From the hexagon outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f013">Figure 13</xref> and from the directional derivatives, we obtain ∂u
 <sub>e2</sub>/∂e
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.219 and ∂u
 <sub>e3</sub>/∂e
 <sub>3</sub> = −0.229.
