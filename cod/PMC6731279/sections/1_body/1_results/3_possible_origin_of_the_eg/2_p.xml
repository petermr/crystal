<p id="Par12">One other possible cause is the oxygen non-stoichiometry. Experimental data show that the overall conductivity decreases with increasing partial oxygen pressure during growth (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), and the overall conductivity increases with increasing thickness of CHO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These findings suggest that oxygen non-stoichiometry in the CHO films (rather than the STO substrate) plays an important role in the formation of EG. The EG may be formed due to the oxygen non-stoichiometry in the CHO films, by transferring electrons to the interfacial STO

 </sup>. A remaining puzzle is why the EG of CHO/STO can survive such a severe annealing in oxygen. One interesting possibility is that the existence of some oxygen vacancies in CHO or the interface of CHO/STO is thermodynamically stable, similar to the cases of the surface of LaAlO
