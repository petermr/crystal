<p>When δ-Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> is cooled from a high temperature, a phase transition to the β phase takes place at 650 °C. Also, the metastable γ-Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> is formed below 650 °C on cooling δ-Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. The structure of β-Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> is a fluorite-based structure, but 25% of the oxide anion is regularly deficient.

 </sup> Although the β and δ phases are unstainable at room temperature, they can be stabilized at room temperature when other cations are introduced into the Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> site to form solid solutions. In fact, niobium- and tantalum-doped (Bi

 <sub>2</sub>O

 </sub> (M = Nb or Ta) solid solutions adopt β phase and δ phase at room temperature, respectively, to exhibit high oxide anion conductivity.
