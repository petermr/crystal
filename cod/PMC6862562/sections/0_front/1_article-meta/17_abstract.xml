 <p>A pressure-induced structural transition from the layered-like phase (
  <italic>Pnma</italic>) to another bilayer structure (
  <italic>Cmcm</italic>) in GeSe was investigated with first principle calculations. The variations of the structural, electronic, elastic, and vibrational properties of GeSe with the application of pressure were obtained. The transformation from the 
  <italic>Pnma</italic> to 
  <italic>Cmcm</italic> phase occurred at 34 GPa. The 
  <italic>Cmcm</italic> phase structure showed dynamical stability above 37 GPa. The lattice parameters and the equation of state varied continuously at the transition pressure. Obvious stiffening in the 
  <italic>C</italic>
  <sub>33</sub> and 
  <italic>C</italic>
  <sub>23</sub> elastic constants associated with the compressive and shear components was observed to occur within the phase transition process. Two characteristic Raman modes (A
  <sub>g</sub> and B
  <sub>3g</sub>) of the 
  <italic>Pnma</italic> phase showed significant softening by increasing the pressure.
