  <p>Chemistry of the surface core level spectrum of EuSn
   <sub>2</sub>P
   <sub>2</sub> measured using 300 eV incident photons. This shows that the P has two different environments (there is only one type of P in the bulk crystal structure) and therefore is present in both the bulk and the surface.
