<p>Afterwards, we also study the effect of uniform strain on the magnetic moments by varying the lattice constant around the equilibrium condition, and the results are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F5">figure 5</xref>. It can be seen that the total and atom-resolved magnetic moments of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in both L2
 <sub>1</sub> and XA structures increase with lattice expanded at positive strain and decrease with lattice contracted at negative strain. For the L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure in both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, the magnetic moments in A and C sites always overlap with each other (Fe1 and Fe2, Ni1 and Ni2) throughout the whole strain variation because they have the same surrounding environment as explained above. The variation of the total magnetic moment is mainly from the Fe atoms and there is almost no change for Si atoms for all cases. While for Ni atoms, different changing trends are observed: a small decrease in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure and a slightly bigger increase in XA structure for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi; no changes in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure and a small increase in XA structure for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi. With lattice decrease, the distance between atoms gets smaller so that the interaction of the valence electrons from different atoms is enhanced and they become more delocalized. The larger variation with strain found from Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in L2
 <sub>1</sub> structure and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in XA structure is all related with Fe atom and this is because of the surrounding Si atom as the nearest neighbours of Fe atom. With strain increase at positive side, the distance between Fe and Si atoms is larger so that Fe atom partially regain its spin moments, and vice versa. In particular, for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in XA structure, the magnetic moment variation of Fe1 is a little larger than Fe2 and this is probably caused by the different neighbouring distance of Si atoms: Si atom is nearest to Fe1 while it is secondary nearest to Fe2. The electronic band structures for both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi under uniform strain have also been calculated and they all show metallic overlap with the Fermi energy in both spin-up and spin-down directions, indicating the metallic behaviour under studied strain condition.
