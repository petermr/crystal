 </sup>. A single crystalline hexagonal plate of LCO, with a size of around 10 µm, was fabricated by a flux method as the target material. LCO is suitable as a model material for the novel analysis method because LCO is a typical material for use at the positive electrode of LIBs. We achieved lithium insertion and extraction of LCO and obtained the mapping image of photoelectrons for selected energy regions at each area under potential control.
