 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">118</xref> The strong electroluminescence (EL) peak at 520 nm was observed at liquid nitrogen temperature, and the maximum brightness of the device was up to 10 000 cd m
 <sup>−2</sup>. The effective EL is attributed to the introduction of OXD7, which not only acts as an appropriate electron transport layer, but also acts as a barrier layer to confine the holes in the emitting layer. This heterostructure provides an approach to achieve efficient LEDs. Sargent's group prepared LEDs with efficient multilayered quasi‐2D perovskite PEA
