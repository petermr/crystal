 <p>The new implementation for image reconstruction and details of software implementation and installation are available: 10.5905/ethz-1007-146.</p>
 <p>Simulated data cannot be provided, but the simulation procedure—phantoms and scanner geometry—has been described in the “
  <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Monte Carlo simulations</xref>” section. Simulated data of any scanner, representable by the above-described block-type implementation in STIR, can be used to replicate the results and validate the findings, namely demonstrate the improved image quality, due to the proper representation of the scanner geometry.
