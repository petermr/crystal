 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, where the misorientation angle varies from zero to the largest possible for cubic symmetry 62.8°. Nevertheless, even for such ambiguous data, some orientation data is still recovered, and it is possible to clearly distinguish wafers (100), (110), (111) even for four measurement channels. Full wafer orientation determination is only possible for nine or more channels.
