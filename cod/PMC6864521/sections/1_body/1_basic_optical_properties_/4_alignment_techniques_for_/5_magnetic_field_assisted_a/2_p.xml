<p>Pietra et al. studied spontaneously self‐assembled aggregates in a suspension of the CdSe/CdS QRs.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> The related measurements addressed the magnetizability α

 <italic>m</italic> is the magnetic dipole moment that is induced by a magnetic field
