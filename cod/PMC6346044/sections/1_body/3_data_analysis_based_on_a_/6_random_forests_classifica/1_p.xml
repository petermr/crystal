<p id="Par26">To detect the quality of the clustering data split, we recurred to defining three classes based on the EM clustering and create a model classifier with them. We proceeded to sample a smaller dataset with 1934 points picked randomly from the 18672 data points. A table was constructed with the 3 PC attributes of the 1934-points dataset. This reduced size dataset was used for training a classification model with three classes: liquid, crystal, amorphous, depending upon which EM cluster the samples belonged to. The Random Forest classifier
