 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> gives the room temperature photoluminescence emission (PL) and excitation (PLE) spectra of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:0.01Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. When monitored at 740 nm, K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:0.01Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> gives an ultra-broad excitation band and a maximum excitation peak is found ~460 nm in the range of 250 and 600 nm. Such a broad excitation band should be ascribed to the 4 f → 5d transition of two different Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> sites in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, as verified by the structural analysis discussed previously, and some sharp lines are related with the spectrophotometer itself. Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref> illustrates the diffuse reflection spectra of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doped and undoped K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> samples. K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> host shows nearly no absorption from 300 to 800 nm, however, K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> exhibits an ultra-broad absorption band from 250 to 600 nm with the introduction of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in the host. K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> exhibits a white body color under natural light suggesting a band gap of about 5 eV (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). The diffuse reflection spectra of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> are in accordance with the excitation spectrum discussed above. Such a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible light region leads to deep red body color under natural light (the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and favors its application for blue light-pumped pc-LEDs. Thus, the NIR emission spectrum under 460 nm excitation reveals a broadband emission centered at 740 nm with FWHM ~160 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This emission is originated from the typical 5d → 4 f transition of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. The asymmetric spectral profile demonstrates that there exists more than one luminescent center in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. To verify this point, the PLE/PL spectra depending on the different experimental conditions are measured in detail. With the increase of excitation wavelengths from 300 to 360 nm, the normalized emission spectra display a large redshift from 695 nm to 745 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). But a small blueshift in emission is observed when the excitation wavelength is increased beyond 360 nm. Also, the peak at 315 nm in the normalized excitation spectra gradually decreased as the monitored wavelength increased from 660 to 800 nm (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). These results proved that multiple luminescent centers existed in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, under the excitation of the laser LED light source with different excitation wavelengths at 375 nm and 450 nm, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref> gives the normalized PL spectra of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:0.01Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, suggesting the simillar spectral profiles.
