 <caption> Fermi surface arc. a High-precision Fermi surface map of YbMnBi 2 at hν = 20.5 eV showing unusual number of features (brown lines) which can be explained by the presence of the arc (dotted line) corresponding to the surface states connecting the Weyl points (green points). b Spectra corresponding to cut #1 shown in panel ( a) by white arrow ( hν = 20.5 eV). White curve is the momentum-distribution curve at the Fermi level showing the presence of six crossings. The inner ones are due to the arc. c Same as in ( b) but for hν = 27 eV. d Zoomed in fragments of panels ( b) and ( c) as well as similar data for other photon energies. e High-precision Fermi surface map of EuMnBi 2. f Spectra along the cut #2 indicated by white arrow in ( e). Photon energy is 27 eV. No sign of the arc is present in the data </caption>
