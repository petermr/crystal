<p>By the MD simulations, the molecular and crystal structures were relaxed, and the pressure response of the lattice was predicted. All results are in good agreement with the experimental measures. The molecular structure from the FF is consistent with that from DFT. Although the FF tends to give smaller lattice parameters, the structure, orient, and relative position of the molecules in the crystal concur with the experiment. Moreover, the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are predicted to be 13.8 GPa and 11.7, which are closer to the experimental measure than several DFT results. Moreover, the packing features of the LLM-105 crystal were analyzed with the intermolecular interaction using an energy decomposition scheme. In LLM-105, the intermolecular interaction is contributed mainly by the electrostatic and dispersion effects. The π–π stacking and HB dominate the crystal packing, and π–π stacking dimers have greater strength than HBs. We found that the FF will give a better equilibrium distance of the π–π system, but underestimate slightly on the bond length of the HB. Because of the underestimation, the FF tends to give a decreased volume by about 5%. The developed FF is used to simulate the behaviors of neat LLM-105 under a shock. To predict its detonation parameters, other FFs have to be developed for the reactions and resulting products. In general, we provide a reliable FF tool for the complicated phenomenon of LLM-105 at a large scale.</p>
