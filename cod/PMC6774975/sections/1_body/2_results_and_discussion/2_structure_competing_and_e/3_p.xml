<p>In general, for full Heusler alloys, site preferences of transition metal elements X and Y are determined by the number of their valence electrons [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]: the element with more valence electrons prefers the A and C sites yet the element with less valence electrons prefers the B site. This rule has been widely used for explaining the atom ordering in Heusler alloy and even applied for new Heusler design. However, there are also some studies showing the contrary results which violate this rule [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It should be stressed that the atom ordering in Heusler alloys strongly influences their properties. In order to determine the stable state of cubic structure Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, we computed their total energy with both L2
 <sub>1</sub>-type and XA-type structures under different lattice constants. Besides, two magnetic states, ferromagnetic (FM) and non-magnetic (NM), have also been considered in each structure type. The results are shown in

 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, respectively.
