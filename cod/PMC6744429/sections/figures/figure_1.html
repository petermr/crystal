 <caption> Design principle of 3D NPCs. a Nonlinear Raman-Nath diffraction orders are generated when a fundamental beam is incident on a 2D nonlinear fork-grating NPC. The SH diffraction pattern exhibits multiple vortex beams with intensity reducing from low to high diffraction orders. However, there exist momentum mismatches Δ k in the propagation directions for various diffraction orders in nonlinear Raman-Nath diffraction. b A 3D nonlinear fork-grating array provides the needed reciprocal vector to compensate momentum mismatch in the propagation direction, so that the selected diffraction orders of SH beams are greatly enhanced. Here, the ±2nd orders are depicted for example. In our experiment, Λ y  = 3 μm. NPC, nonlinear photonic crystal; SH, second-harmonic; QPM, quasi-phase-matching, 2D, two-dimensional; 3D, three-dimensional </caption>
