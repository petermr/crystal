 </sup>) have been provided by Mineralogical Museum, CeNak, University of Hamburg. Three separate in situ high-pressure SCXRD were performed at the experimental station P02.2 (extreme conditions beamline) at synchrotron Petra III (Hamburg, Germany). Symmetric DACs with culets diameter of 300, 200, and 150 μm were used for pressure generation in experiments #
 <bold>1</bold>, #
 <bold>2</bold>, and #
 <bold>3</bold>, respectively. The sample chambers with approximate diameters of 150, 100, and 85 μm were obtained by drilling the preindented rhenium gasket. Hurlbutite crystals were placed inside the sample chambers along with a ruby sphere for pressure estimation (Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. The DACs were loaded with neon as pressure-transmitting medium using the in-house gas loading system at Petra III. Monochromatic X-ray diffraction experiments were performed using X-rays with wavelength of ~0.2905 Å. The X-ray beam was focused to less than 10 × 10 μm by Kirkpatrick–Baez mirrors for experiments #
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>#3</bold> and by Compound Reflective Lenses for experiment #
 <bold>2</bold>

 <sub>2</sub> standard using the procedure implemented in the program Dioptas
