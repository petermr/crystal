<p id="Par11">We investigated an unprecedented reversible phase transformation between layered and spinel-like structure during reduction/oxidation of a layered-structure oxide. This surprising result was observed in the birnessite structure. The mechanism for its phase reversibility was elucidated by in-depth structural characterizations combined with first-principles calculations. These results indicate the formation of a metastable spinel-like phase during ion extraction, which enables this unusual reversibility in its phase transformation. Moreover, the migration energy of Mn ions from an octahedral geometry in MnO
 <sub>6</sub> slab to a tetrahedral geometry in Na layer turned out to be regulated by the existence of crystal water in Na layer. The findings from the first-principles calculation coupled with advanced structural analyses substantiated that the contents of crystal water are very important in forming the metastable spinel-like structure which plays a key role in high reversibility of phase transformation. Furthermore, this reversible transformation was accompanied by the successful accommodation of volume change enabling very stable cyclic retention. We firmly believe that these unprecedented findings provide invaluable insight into the search for novel class of electrode or electronic materials that are away from the limitation given by their characteristic crystal structures. Hence, this work will not only broaden the structural candidates as electrode materials in advanced secondary batteries, but also establish new research directions in materials science.
