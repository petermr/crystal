 <caption> Correlations among the Pb displacements. a Clusters of Pb atoms having a local displacement-alignment metric α (see text) for the first Pb–Pb coordination sphere less than 45° (spatially distinct clusters are labeled using different colors). As a reference, α = 0° and α = 180° correspond to the parallel and antiparallel displacements of a given atom and its neighbors, respectively. The clusters have been identified according to the HDBSCAN 33 algorithm. The search procedure accounted for the periodic boundary conditions; however, for visualization purposes, we assigned a distinct color to each region within the configuration box. b Magnitudes of the Pb displacements plotted against α; a strong negative correlation between the two characteristics is observed. The inset illustrates variation of the displacement magnitude for the Pb columns across the α-PNR boundary, as derived from panel c. c A 2D map of displacements for the Pb columns projected onto a {110} plane; the color-scale bar reflects the displacement magnitude in Å and the arrows are used to illustrate the displacement directions. The x and y axes correspond to the orthogonal [110] and [001] directions. This distribution agrees with the analogous maps deduced from experimental atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy images of PbMg 1/3Nb 2/3O 3. The displacements decay monotonically toward the boundaries. d 3D rendering of a representative α-PNR, with the constituent Pb atoms (represented by spheres) that are displaced along the inequivalent 〈111〉 directions (labeled in the figure) indicated using different colors </caption>
