<p id="Par7">O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> in the 48
 <italic>g</italic> site participates in chemical bonds with two Ca and two Ge, whereas O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> in the 96
 <italic>h</italic>′ site participates in chemical bonds with one Ca, one Fe, and two Ge. The bond lengths are optimized to be closer to their optimal values in the perfect crystal structure after relaxation of their internal coordinates. The Ca–O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> bond length is slightly shorter than the Ca–O bond length in the perfect crystal, whereas the Ge–O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and Fe–O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> bond lengths are slightly longer than the Ge–O and Fe–O bond lengths in the perfect crystal, respectively. In addition, O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> in the 48
 <italic>g</italic> or 96
 <italic>h</italic>′ sites participate in several bonds with O. The O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>–O bond lengths are generally longer than the cation–O bond lengths and shorter than the O–O distance in the perfect crystal structure, but some of them are similar to the Ca–O bond length.
