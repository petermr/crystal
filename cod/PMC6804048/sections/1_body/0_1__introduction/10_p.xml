<p>The present study focused on the TM
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>X (TM = Nb, Ti, X = Al, Si) compounds. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to evaluate the stability and elastic properties and heats of formation of the above ternary intermetallic phases. The data presented in this paper will contribute towards improving the adherence of scales formed on Nb-silicide based alloys and the current understanding of the oxidation and phase equilibria of Nb-silicide based alloys at high temperatures.
