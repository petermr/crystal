<p>The co-crystals were also characterized using PXRD and DSC to identify the formation of the co-crystal phase (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03936-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The PXRD experiments show new diffraction patterns in the co-crystals compared with PROG and the bare CCFs, and coincide with the simulated PXRD patterns, indicating the formation of a new co-crystal phase. The DSC profile of PROG-CNA presents an endothermic peak at 118.2 °C (∆H = −64.3 J/g) due to the melting point of the co-crystal. In the case of PROG and CNA this peak is visible at 131.5 °C and at 108.8 °C, respectively. The characteristic 2θ peaks of the PROG-DHB co-crystal are located at 9.79, 13.58, 14.60, 17.37, 17.77, 19.15, 20.25, 21.98, 25.39, and 27.62 degrees. This PXRD pattern shows the formation of the PROG-DHB co-crystal. The DSC profile of PROG-DHB presents an endothermic peak at 178.2 °C (∆H = −79.8 J/g) which appears at 131.5 °C in the case of PROG and at 212.3 °C in the case of DHB. The characteristic 2θ peaks of the PROG-DOD co-crystal obtained by PXRD are located at 7.85, 15.35, 16.81, 17.19, 17.52, 18.39, 20.95, 35.70, and 44.01 degrees. The DSC profile of PROG-DOD shows an endothermic peak at 199.5 °C (∆H = −42.2 J/g). In this case, the peak is also located at a different temperature compared to its bare constituents (PROG 131.5 °C and DOD 287.7 °C). The endothermic peak of the co-crystals are between API and CCFs, this shift in the position of the endothermic peaks is consistent with the majority of co-crystals.
