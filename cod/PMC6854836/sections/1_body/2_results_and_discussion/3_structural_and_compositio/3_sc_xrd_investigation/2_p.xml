<p>High-resolution SC-XRD data were collected from several α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystals. Particular attention was paid to the possible presence of superstructure reflections, indicating long-range correlation of disorder. However, we could not detect superstructure reflections for any of the investigated crystals. For the initial independent atom refinement, we employed the structure model of Magnusson and Brosset (MB), which assumes the polar icosahedral position as mixed B/Si site and a single isotropic atomic displacement parameter (ADP) for all atoms (
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>iso</sub> = 0.0143 Å
 <sup>2</sup>). Due to the high resolution of our data, individual and anisotropic ADPs could be introduced immediately. The position and ADP of the mixed site was constrained to be equal, and the sum of occupancies was constrained to unity. The obtained atom position parameters agreed reasonably with the MB results. The occupancy of the mixed site, 32.4(6)% Si, corresponds to a composition SiB
 <sub>2.55(3)</sub>, which is significantly lower than the result of MB (i.e., SiB
 <sub>2.89</sub>) and only slightly larger than the ideal, electron-precise stoichiometry of SiB
 <sub>2.5</sub> with two Si atoms per icosahedron. However, the MB model is intrinsically flawed with respect to its interatomic distances. For example, the length of the exo-bond connecting two icosahedra via polar atoms is 1.632(2) Å, which is actually shorter than the B
 <sup>p</sup>–B
 <sup>p</sup> exo-distance in the α-B
 <sub>12</sub> structure, and thus far too short to also account for a Si–B exo-bond. In addition, the refinement only converged at a modest 
 <italic>R</italic>-value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 10.1%. The residual electron density ranged from −4.5 to 10.2 e/Å
 <sup>3</sup>. The maximum in residual electron density (positive 
 <italic>Q</italic>-peak) was located inside the icosahedron at a distance of approximately 0.42 Å to the mixed occupied polar site.
