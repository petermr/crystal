<p id="Par26">The 3D-SAROM analysis has several limitations. The depth of scanning is limited by the material transparency and Raman scattering cross-section

 </sup> of the sample at laser/Raman scattering wavelengths: for the polycrystalline sapphire study the maximum depth is ~0.1 mm at 785 nm laser wavelength. In-depth SAROM mapping is also limited by off-axis laser refraction effects leading to Raman signal attenuation and decreased axial resolution

 </sup>. In order to minimize these effects we used oil immersion microscope objective for 3D measurements of polycrystalline sapphire (Supplementary Fig.
