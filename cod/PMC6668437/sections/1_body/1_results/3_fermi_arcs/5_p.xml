<p id="Par21">The results of the finite-slab calculations of YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref> prove the presence of the topological Fermi surface arcs, surface state dispersion parallel to bulk bands (as in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and clarify one important experimental observation. In a number of experiments on different samples we have always observed qualitatively similar to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> picture as regards the Fermi arcs location, implying that it does not strongly depend on which exactly surface is actually exposed. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref> demonstrates that the arcs and supporting dispersions representing the upper (red) and lower (blue) surfaces are very close to each other and qualitatively similar.
