<p>The fluorescence spectra of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs with various concentrations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f004">Figure 4</xref>, where the peak appears at the emission wavelength of 300 nm. Considering the excitation wavelength of 280 nm, the present SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs show a low Stocks shift. The self-quenching property of QDs was observed when the Sn concentration increased. The heavy metal ion solutions of 100 ppm were incorporated with the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs and the incorporations result in the quenching of fluorescence, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f005">Figure 5</xref>. It was observed that Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> perform stronger attenuations to the fluorescence emission than other heavy metals. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f006">Figure 6</xref>a illustrates the fluorescence responses of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs to the various heavy metal ions. The QDs show responses to all the heavy metals, which may interact with QDs by interfering the electronic transition from conduction band to valence band. The Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> incorporation stimulates the highest response of 2.48.
