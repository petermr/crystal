<p>K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> was reported in 2005 by Graetz et al. [
 <xref rid="B267-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> was produced by the ball-milling of 2KH + LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B267-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Graetz et al. determined an 
 <italic>Fm-3m</italic> structure for K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub>. However, in their paper, they recognized that the diffraction pattern was not suitable for Rietveld analysis [
 <xref rid="B267-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Briefly, after that, Rönnebro et al. performed the mechanical milling of the same precursors followed by a heating treatment of the pelletized sample at 320–330 °C and 700 bar for 1–2 days. By doing this, K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> was crystallized, and its crystal structure was determined to have 
 <italic>R3m</italic> symmetry (
 <xref rid="materials-12-02724-t015" ref-type="table">Table 15</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B286-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. As in the case of Na
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub>, theoretical calculations (predating synthesis and crystal structure determination) predicted that K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> would have 
 <italic>P 2
  <sub>1</sub>/n
 </italic> symmetry (
 <xref rid="materials-12-02724-t015" ref-type="table">Table 15</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02724-f023">Figure 23</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B282-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>,
 <xref rid="B283-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>]. The differences between the calculated and the experimental data could be related to the temperature of calculation (0 K) versus the temperature of synthesis and testing (near room temperature).
