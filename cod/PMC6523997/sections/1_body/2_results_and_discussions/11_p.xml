 </xref>a, the 3-CPACl additive induces crystal orientation and a highly oriented and stable pseudocubic structure as only the specific diffractions corresponding to (100) and (200), at 14.04° and 28.24°, remain. To estimate the crystallite sizes, the Scherrer equation was applied to the most intense peak (100) in the XRD pattern. The average crystallite size in the pristine perovskite in the perovskite containing Zn(II) and in the one containing Zn(II) and treated with 3-CPACl was found to be 36, 54, and 114 nm, respectively, indicating enlargement in size of the perovskite crystallites.
