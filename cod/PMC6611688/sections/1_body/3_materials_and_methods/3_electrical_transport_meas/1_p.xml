<p>The temperature-dependent resistance of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> was measured in a home-built variable temperature system. The SdH oscillations were measured in an Oxford dilution fridge with a base temperature of 30 mK and magnetic fields up to 10 T. The magnetic field direction was perpendicular to the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane of the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> sample.
