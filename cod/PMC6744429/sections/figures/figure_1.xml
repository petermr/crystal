   <bold>a</bold> Nonlinear Raman-Nath diffraction orders are generated when a fundamental beam is incident on a 2D nonlinear fork-grating NPC. The SH diffraction pattern exhibits multiple vortex beams with intensity reducing from low to high diffraction orders. However, there exist momentum mismatches Δ
   <bold>k</bold> in the propagation directions for various diffraction orders in nonlinear Raman-Nath diffraction. 
   <bold>b</bold> A 3D nonlinear fork-grating array provides the needed reciprocal vector to compensate momentum mismatch in the propagation direction, so that the selected diffraction orders of SH beams are greatly enhanced. Here, the ±2nd orders are depicted for example. In our experiment,
