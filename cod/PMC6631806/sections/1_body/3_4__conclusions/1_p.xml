<p>Here, we theoretically study triply periodic nanoscale mesophases of molten block copolymers in search of useful nanomaterials for catalytic activity or mass transport capability. Taking linear AB or ABC block copolymers as a model system, whose j-blocks are 
 <italic>N
  <sub>j</sub>
 </italic>-mers with 
 <italic>N</italic> being the overall size of the chosen copolymers, field-theoretic simulations based on Edwards Gaussian random-walk approach are performed for our purposes. Without finite compressibility, Helfand’s conventional self-consistent field analysis is undertaken to evaluate the canonical partition function at its saddle point while ensuring the incompressibility constraint. In case of compressible copolymers, the recently developed analysis is undertaken to combine Helfand’s theory with a molecular equation-of-state model.
