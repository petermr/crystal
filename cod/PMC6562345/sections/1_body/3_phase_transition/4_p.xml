<p>In the metal formate perovskites, all known phase transitions are of this second type, preserving the cubic network topology. Indeed, this topology is even recoverable from a pressure-induced amorphous phase [
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Certainly, this is the case for the 
 <bold>MGF</bold> compounds: the two phases have the same coordination number and topology, but differ instead in the orientation of the 
 <bold>A</bold>-site guanidinium cations. To our knowledge, this is the first reported phase transition between two 
 <italic>ordered</italic> phases of a hybrid perovskite with different guest ion orientations.
