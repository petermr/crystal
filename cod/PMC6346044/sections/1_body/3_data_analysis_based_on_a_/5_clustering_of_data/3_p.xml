<p id="Par25">In summary, this unsupervised machine learning approach is very successful. By only inspecting the topological characteristics of the simulated structures, the approach is able to assign the structures to the correct thermodynamics behavior obtained in the traditional simulations. To verify how stable is the data split determined by the clustering method, in the next section we create a data classification model defining three 
 <italic>classes</italic> as the three clusters obtained in this section.
