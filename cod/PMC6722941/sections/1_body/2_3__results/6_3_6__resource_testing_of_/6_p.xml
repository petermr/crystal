<p>The presence in the structure of electrode material of a significant number of amorphous inclusions leads to a sharp degradation of the material and a decrease in the number of operating cycles. It should be noted that the degree of oxidation of Fe completely changes when the electrode is lithiated and divisible, which result in subsequent degradation of the electrode material. The difference between the charging curve of the first cycle and the following ones is attributable to the slight amorphization of the electrode material.</p>
