<p>When anisotropic material properties are introduced into the component phase (i.e., fibrous phase and matrix phase) of a composite material, the alignment of the material local property axis with respect to the composite material coordinate system plays a key role in the effective properties of the composite. Many 1D inclusions, such as carbon nanotubes [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], have different material properties along and perpendicular to the fiber axis direction. Therefore, in this study, we used the subscript “p” to represent the properties on the cross-sectional plane of the fiber and subscript “a” to represent properties along fiber axis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). As for the matrix phase, we used the material local axis system “uvw” to describe the anisotropic material properties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). There are four sets of coordinate systems in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>, which are the local material coordinate system of the fibrous and matrix phase, the coordinate system of composite C
 <sub>1</sub>(F + M
 <sub>1</sub>), and the coordinate system of unit cell C
 <sub>2</sub>(F + M
 <sub>1</sub> + M
 <sub>2</sub>). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the coordinate axes u, x
 <sub>1</sub>, and x
 <sub>2</sub> align parallel to each other; v, y
 <sub>1</sub>, and y
 <sub>2</sub> align parallel to each other, and a, w, z
 <sub>1</sub>, and z
 <sub>2</sub> align parallel to each other. The cross-sectional plane of fiber (p–p) is parallel with the u–v plane of the matrix material.
