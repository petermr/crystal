 <caption> (a) XRD patterns of Na 3AlF 6: x% Cr 3+ ( x = 1, 5, 20, 60, 100) representatives and that of Na 3AlF 6 (PDF #01-082-0218) and Na 3CrF 6 (PDF #27-0675) standards. The green frames label the coexisting byproducts, (NH 4) 2NaCrF 6, as the Cr 3+ doping concentration exceeds 60â€“70% (see detailed discussion in Figures S1 and S2). (b, c) XRD Rietveld refinement results for the samples of 5% Cr 3+ (b) and 80% Cr 3+ (c) doped Na 3AlF 6 showing raw data (black crosses) and calculated (red solid line) XRD profiles, difference between the raw data and calculated patterns (blue solid line), and Bragg reflection positions (pink and neon blue short vertical lines). (d) SEM micrographs and (e) EDX spectra analysis of the as-prepared Na 3AlF 6:60% Cr 3+ sample. </caption>
