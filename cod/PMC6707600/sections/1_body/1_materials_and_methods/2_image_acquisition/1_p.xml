<p>The image acquisition parameters for 3-D PCX-CT had been described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, specimens were visualized using a phase-contrast imaging system fitted with a crystal X-ray interferometer [
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The system was set up at the vertical wiggler beamline (PF BL-14C) of the Photon Factory in Tsukuba, Japan. The white synchrotron radiation emitted from the wiggler was monochromated by a Si(220) double-crystal monochromator, horizontally magnified by an asymmetric crystal, and inputted into the imaging system. The generated interference patterns were detected by a large-area X-ray imager, which consisted of a 30-μm scintillator, relay lens system, and water-cooled charge-coupled device camera (36 × 36 mm field of view, 2048 × 2048 pixels, 18 × 18 μm each) [
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The X-ray energy was tuned at 17.8 keV, and an exposure time of 3 s was used to obtain one interference pattern. The average intensity was approximately 300 counts/pixel, which allowed for high-resolution observations within a reasonable measurement time.
