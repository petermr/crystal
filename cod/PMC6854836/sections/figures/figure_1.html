 <caption> Crystal structure of rhombohedral α-B 12 and its (major) “icosahedral boron-rich” derivatives. In the α-B 12 structure, icosahedral B 12 units are arranged as in a cubic close packing. (a) Arrangement of B 12 units within a close-packed layer. Intralayer 3c2e bonds involving equatorial B atoms are indicated as pink triangles. (b) Rhombohedral unit cell of α-B 12 with stacking of layers indicated. Terminal (exo) 2c2e bonds connecting icosahedra between layers are depicted as yellow lines. (c) In the binary/ternary derivatives, interlayer 3c2e bonds are replaced by terminal 2c2e bonds to interstitial atoms. From left to right: B 4C ([B 11C p] −[CBC] +), B 6P ([B 12] 2–[P 2] 2+), B 6O ([B 12] 2–[O +] 2). The center of the interstitial atoms corresponds to the location of the octahedral void in the cubic close packing. </caption>
