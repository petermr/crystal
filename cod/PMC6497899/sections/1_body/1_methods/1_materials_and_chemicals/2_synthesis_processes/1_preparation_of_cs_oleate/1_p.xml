<p id="Par31">The cesium-oleate solution was prepared according to the approach by Kovalenko and co-workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In brief, 0.8 g of Cs
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mL of OA, and 30 mL of ODE were loaded in a three-neck flask and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h. Next, the flask was switched to N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere and heated to 150 °C until all the Cs
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> dissolved.
