 </sup> recently hypothesized a similar scenario for nakhlites and chassignites demonstrating that these lithologies were emplaced close or onto the surface of Mars as multiple flows. The proposed process explains at the same time the fast cooling rates recorded by the textures of the rock and the low closure temperatures recorded by the single minerals (e.g. intracrystalline exchange in pyroxenes) for which the subsequent magma emplacement would then re-equilibrate the system at much lower temperatures similar to those expected for high thicknesses single lava pile, at least for the peridotite-pyroxenite transition. This has profound implications for our understanding of multiscale mechanisms for lava flow emplacements on Earth and other planetary bodies.
