<p id="Par35">The surface of the polycrystalline Si was mechanically polished prior to EBSD investigation. Silica microparticles having dimensions of 6, 3, and 1 µm were sprayed on a rotating diamond grinding disc for the polishing. Starting with the larger microparticle size, the sample was alternately polished and visually inspected using an optical microscope. The inspection was necessary to verify that the surface was without scratches along a particular direction, index of an inhomogeneous polishing. The same polishing procedure was repeated using each microparticle size.</p>
