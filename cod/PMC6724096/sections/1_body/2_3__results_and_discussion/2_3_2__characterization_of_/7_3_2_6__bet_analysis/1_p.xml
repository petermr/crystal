<p>In order to analyze the surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of photocatalysts, N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorptionâ€“desorption isotherms were measured, and the corresponding data are shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f009">Figure 9</xref>, the adsorption trend and desorption trend of pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, 1.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and 5.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> prepared by IS-RPB show sharp changes at P/P
 <sub>0</sub> between 0.6 and 0.9, indicating that isotherms are the IV-type and that the pore is mesoporous. The hysteretic loop formed by the curve is obviously H2-type, indicating that the catalyst has an ink-bottle-type pore structure [
 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. P25 corresponds to the non-porous II-type isotherm. In the pore size distribution diagram and 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the three catalysts prepared by IS-RPB show similar small and narrow pore size distributions and a similar total pore volume, while P25 has a wide pore size distribution and a pore size of 30.56 nm, which is the reason the specific surface area of the three catalysts is larger than P25.
