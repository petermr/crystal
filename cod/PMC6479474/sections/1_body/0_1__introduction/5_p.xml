<p>Therefore, the earlier studies [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have recognized the importance for spectra calculation of the proper description of the chemical neighborhood in crystalline melamine, in particular, the hydrogen bonding network. However, the methodology in these studies has been limited to finite models, clusters of melamine molecules (10 to 32 molecules). Although improved vs. single molecule models, the finite boundary of these model clusters has led to the distortions of the molecular structure as compared with the structure of the crystal lattice of melamine. This has resulted in a number of “phantom bands” appearing in the calculated IR and Raman spectra, which could not be observed in the experimental spectra [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additionally, these previous studies have been limited to harmonic approximation, which made any calculations of NIR bands unavailable. Accordingly, there are no NIR spectra simulations of melamine of any kind reported so far. On the other hand, melamine was intensively focused on in analytical near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) [
