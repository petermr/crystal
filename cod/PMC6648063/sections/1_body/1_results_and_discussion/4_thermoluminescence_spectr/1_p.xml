<p>In the long-lasting phosphor activated by Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, co-doped trivalent rare-earth ions are frequently non-luminescent. Instead, they store energy as a trap center and gradually release the energy at the function of temperature. They transmit the energy to the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> luminescent center to generate persistent luminescence. The intensity of persistent luminescence and the time of duration are frequently decided by the existing state of the trap. To research the generating process of the persistent luminescence and the function of Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> in BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, we test the three-dimensional thermoluminescence spectra of the sample.
