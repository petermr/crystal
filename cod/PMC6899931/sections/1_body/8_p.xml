<p>The distribution of the electron localizability indicator (ELI‐D) reveals the typical picture of four‐bonded silicon atoms. The maxima visualized by the isosurface with ELI‐D=1.44 (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> a–c) are located on or close to the bond lines between silicon atoms. Moreover, the corresponding basin populations of these attractors (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> a) amount to values of around two electrons. The intersection of the atomic basins of magnesium with the bonding basins of the Si−Si bonds indicate only a small contribution of Mg to three‐atom interactions, as suggested by the location of small parts of the Si−Si bonding basins within the atomic basin of Mg (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> c). A new feature of the ELI‐D appears in vicinity of the Si2 atoms within the cavity labeled B. The local ELI‐D maximum reveals a lone‐pair‐like interaction between neighboring Si2 atoms in the (100) plane across the cavity. Although the population of 0.27 electrons for the according basin (light yellow in Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> b, c) is rather small, its presence is the first hint to additional interactions within the crystal structure. This is also suggested by an analysis of the electronic DOS.
