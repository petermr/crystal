<p id="Par45">Vibrational spectra of coesite-IV at pressure 
 <italic>P</italic> = 39 GPa and coesite-V at 
 <italic>P</italic> = 57 GPa are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a, b</xref>, respectively. No imaginary frequencies were observed in either of the phases, i.e., both of them are dynamically stable at pressures where they are observed experimentally. However, our results suggest that coesite-IV and coesite-V are metastable phases of silica. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> shows the differences between the enthalpies of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> phases considered in this study, coesite-IV, coesite-V, as well as seifertite (α-PbO
 <sub>2</sub>-type structure) relative to the enthalpy of stishovite/CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>-type silica. One can see that the former two are much higher in enthalpy in comparison to the latter. At the same time, the stability of the coesite-IV phase relative to the coesite-V phase is correctly reproduced in our calculations. Indeed, the former is more stable at lower pressure, while the latter has a lower enthalpy above 38 GPa. Note that the optimization (relaxation) of the crystal structure of coesite-IV at unit cell volume of 352.35 Å
 <sup>3</sup> resulted in its spontaneous transformation into coesite-V phase. At this volume (corresponding to experimental pressure of 49 GPa, i.e., the highest experimental pressure at which coesite-IV phase is observed experimentally) as well as at lower volumes (higher pressures), coesite-IV phase exhibits instability resulting in coesite-IV&gt; coesite-V transition. The direct pathway between the phases is shown in Supplementary Movie
