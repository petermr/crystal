<p>(ii) Identification of control points: The success of automatic photogrammetric correlation is the detection of common points in consecutive images. To do this, an initial adjustment is made to all the images to detect a series of common points and ensure that their relative position is the same as at the time of capture [

This first adjustment of the frames can be processed with mathematical algorithms, such as area based matching (ABM) defined as a correlation based on the area, or featured based matching (FBM), which is a correlation based on operators SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) and SURF (speeded-up robust features) [
