<p id="Par8">The local structure, chemical composition and morphology of NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor were further investigated to assess this newly discovered ultra-narrow-band cyan-emitting phosphor. First, the 
 <sup>7</sup>Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum was measured. As displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, the 
 <sup>7</sup>Li NMR spectrum shows two signals at 2.721 and 4.402 ppm, which are consistent with the two different Li crystallographic sites in this host. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the NKLSO powder sample are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>, which indicates that the average particle size of the sample is ~5–10 μm, and a well-developed crystalline particle and smooth surface will help the luminescence properties and incorporation into LED packages. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) show a uniform distribution of Na, K, Si, and O in the particle, and the average atomic ratios Na(0.5):K(0.44):Si(1.1) determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) are consistent with the formula Na
 <sub>0.58(4)</sub>K
 <sub>0.42(4)</sub>Li
 <sub>3</sub>SiO
 <sub>4</sub> obtained from the Rietveld refinement result from the XRD pattern.
