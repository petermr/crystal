 <caption> Comparison of the CO 2 Henry coefficient and the adsorption energy at infinite dilution for nonoptimized COFs with Qeq partial charges and DFT-optimized COFs with DDEC charges. Dashed lines show the condition of equal values for both axes. The color of the markers indicates the absolute change of the geometric void fraction after the optimization. Points that lie close to the axes (i.e., null Henry Coefficient and adsorption energy) indicate nonpermeable structures, where all the pores are inaccessible. Blocking spheres have been used in all the calculations to exclude inaccessible pores, as described in the Methods section. </caption>
