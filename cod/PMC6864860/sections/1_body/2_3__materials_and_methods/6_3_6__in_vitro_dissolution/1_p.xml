<p>The tests were carried out on an RC806D dissolution apparatus (Tianjin Tianda Tianfa Technology Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) with the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) apparatus II (paddle-type). The dissolution media was purified water. Before the dissolution study, the powders were sieved using a 200 mesh screen, a step which was repeated three times. Progesterone (30 mg) and progesterone co-crystals corresponding to 30 mg of progesterone were added to 100 mL of dissolution media. The rotation speed was set at 100 rpm with a dissolution bath temperature of 37.0 ± 0.5 °C. Aliquots of the dissolution medium were withdrawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. The dissolution media was replaced with an equivalent volume of fresh media at 37 °C. The withdrawn slurry was filtered and progesterone concentrations were determined using HPLC. This method used a chromatographic system with Empower 3 software (Waters Technology, Milford, MA, USA) which was equipped with a photo-diode array (PDA) detector. The mobile phase consisted of methanol, acetonitrile, and water (25:35:40). The mobile phase was degassed and pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min through a reversed phase column 250 mm × 4.6 mm (i.d.) BDS Hypersil C8 with an average particle size of 5 µm. The effluent was detected at 241 nm.</p>
