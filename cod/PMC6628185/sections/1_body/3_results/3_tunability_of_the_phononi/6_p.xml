<p>The period of the TSL not only determines the number, frequency, and intensity of the folding-originated modes but it also affects the frequency of the “bulklike” modes, namely TO and LO. In

 </xref>a, we compare theoretical and experimental frequencies of TO mode as a function of the TSL period. We consider the WZ as a TSL with vanishing period and the ZB as a TSL with asymptotically long period (for the plot we set it equal to 1200 nm, i.e., about twice the laser spot) and plot the absolute frequency shifts from the calculated and experimental TO mode of the ZB as open and filled symbols, respectively. The theory predicts a gradual upshift with increasing period (i.e., decreasing frequency shift with respect to the ZB TO). The experimental values nicely reproduce this behavior. Although the shift of the TO mode with the TSL period is quite small, its observation is an important confirmation that we are probing the phonons of the TSL and that our theory provides an accurate description of the physics involved. For the sake of completeness, we have also considered the hypothetical situation in which the TO shifts arise from the fact that in our scattering volume, we have portions of ZB (namely, the segments sandwiched between two consecutive TSL planes) and portions of WZ (namely, the TSL planes, which can be viewed as WZ inclusions consisting of one single AB bilayer). Therefore, we develop a simple model where we weigh each contribution (ZB and WZ) with the corresponding volume ratio, and the TSL spectrum is computed as a linear combination of the theoretical ZB and WZ spectra. We then analyze the obtained spectra to extract the TO frequency shift as a function of TSL period. The results are displayed by the gray dashed curve in

 </xref>a. The inset shows the difference between the data and the curve. By construction, the curve intersects the WZ and ZB theoretical data, while it does not provide an accurate estimate of the TSL TO theoretical frequencies (the difference is indeed about 0.5 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), which were computed by considering the whole TSL crystal with its own symmetry and not as a weighted sum of large ZB and thin WZ portions. The same difference is observed in the experimental data as well. It is worth noticing that for periods around 40 nm, the measured TO mode frequency is very close to the one of the ZB structure and does not differ significantly from the one of the simplified model, whereas the deviations for periods up to 30–35 nm lead us to infer the TSL period up to which we observe coherent phonon effects. However, as the discrepancy between the dashed curve and the TSL theoretical data is quite small, one might still conclude that the simplified model gives a reasonable prediction of the TO frequencies of the TSL. In this respect, it is very important to stress that a similar approach is incapable of predicting other crucial features observed in our experiments and calculations, such as the appearance of spectral features between the TO and the LO mode, which are remarkable and unambiguous signatures of the coherent phonon propagation enabled by the superlattice, as well as the intensity and frequency of the E

Only the ab initio calculation of the TSL crystal accounts for the observed intensities, while those resulting from the weighted WZ/ZB segments are lower than the experimental intensities. Even more striking, the model of weighted crystal phase contribution cannot account for a dependence of the frequency of the E
