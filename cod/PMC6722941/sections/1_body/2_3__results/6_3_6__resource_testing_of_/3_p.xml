<p>As can be seen from the data presented, after the endurance tests, a sharp decrease in the degree of crystallinity is observed, which indicates an increase in the structure of amorphous-like inclusions and regions of disorder. At the same time, the greatest decrease in the degree of crystallinity is stipulated for samples whose structure initially contained a high concentration of dislocation defects and disordered regions, while for samples annealed there is less change in the degree of crystallinity, which leads to an increase in the lifetime of nanostructures.</p>
