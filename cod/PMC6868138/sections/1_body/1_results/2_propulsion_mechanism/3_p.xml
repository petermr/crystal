<p id="Par13">When a droplet reaches the top or bottom boundaries of the chamber, it gets trapped and starts swimming in circles. Although the trapping mechanism is possibly different, a similar behavior is found for microorganisms swimming close to boundaries (for a case of trapping that involves Ph-
