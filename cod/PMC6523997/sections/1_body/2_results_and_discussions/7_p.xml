<p>The absorption, shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>b, does not show significant changes compared to the freshly made film. Combining these results with the visual degradation of thin films over time (inset in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>a), we conclude that Zn(II) incorporation stabilizes our perovskite against environmental moisture.
