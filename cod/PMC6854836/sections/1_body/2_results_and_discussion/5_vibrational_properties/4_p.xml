 </xref>. According to group theory, there are 10 Raman-active modes for α-B
 <sub>12</sub>, which distribute according to four A
 <sub>1g</sub> and six E
 <sub>g</sub>. The modes were first assigned by Beckel et al.,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">92</xref>
 </sup> a more recent discussion is given in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref>). The pair of A
 <sub>1g</sub> and E
 <sub>g</sub> bands at highest wavenumbers (at 1187 and 1122 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively) is associated with stretching modes of exo-bonded B
 <sup>p</sup> atoms connecting icosahedra. The next A
 <sub>1g</sub> and E
 <sub>g</sub> pair (at 931 and 871 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively) is associated with localized icosahedral (skeleton) modes. The A
 <sub>1g</sub> mode at 793 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> corresponds to a radially in-and-out (breathing) movement of B
 <sup>e</sup> atoms and thus can be associated with a stretching mode of the 3c bonds. In the E
 <sub>g</sub> mode at 774 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, 2c and 3c bonds are strained significantly. The E
 <sub>g</sub> mode at 710 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is associated with a deformation of polar triangles and thus relates to deformation/bending of exo-bonds between B
 <sup>p</sup> atoms. The pair of A
 <sub>g</sub> and Eg bands at 691 and 598 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively, may be associated with bending of 3c bonds. Finally, the sharp line at 523 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (which is a E
 <sub>g</sub> mode) corresponds to libration of icosahedra.
