<p id="P11">When M
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) complexes are placed in a crystalline environment, the energy distributions in the 
 <bold>CRS-0,1</bold> systems resemble those of 
 <bold>COS-0,1</bold>, but with noticeable alterations. First, the relative energy spread is increased further by 
 <italic>ca.</italic> 25–30%. Second, the stability of the conformers near 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 0 and 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 2π/3 is enhanced in 
 <bold>CRS-0</bold> compared to 
 <bold>COS-0</bold>. Thus, the ordering effect on the Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N cluster is stronger in the crystal than in the isolated Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) complex. Third, for 
 <bold>CRS-1</bold> the crystalline environment enhances the relative stability of the conformers with 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 2π/3. The conformer with the vertical orientation of the Y–N bond (
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 0) is still the most stable, but the structure with the flipped positions of Y and Sc is only 2.5 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> higher. Thus, the crystalline environment enhances the preferential orientation of the nitride clusters but makes the Y and Sc positions in YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> less energetically different. This agrees with our recent study of DYSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) crystals,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 </sup> which showed that the vertical orientation of the Dy–N bond was more preferable, but the site with the flipped Sc and Dy positions had up to ~20% occupancy in one of the crystal batches.
