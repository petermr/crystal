<p>The synchrotron radiation XRD measurements under high pressure were performed at GeoSoilEnviroCARS (GSECARS), beamline 13-BM-C of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. A monochromatic x-ray beam was used with a wavelength of 0.434 Ã…. Experimental fitting of synchrotron radiation XRD data was carried out using TOPAS3 (
