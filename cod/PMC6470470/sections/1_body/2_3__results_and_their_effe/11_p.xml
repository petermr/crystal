<p>Our drag coefficient for Mo is lower than the MD-simulation value of ∼0.078 mPas for edge dislocations reported in [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Similarly, our drag coefficient for Ni is lower than the MD-simulation results of 0.0321 mPas for edge dislocations reported in [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and ∼0.015 mPas for edge dislocations reported in [

 <xref rid="B66-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], albeit close to the latter.
