<p id="Par10">Primary-Au solid solutions with Ag and Cu as solutes are of interest here. Like Au, Ag has substantially zero Si solubility, and does not form stable silicides. On the other hand, Cu is known to promote bulk-glass formation in Au-Si (ref.

 </sup>), and although Cu has a finite solubility of Si and forms stable silicides, its concentration can be limited such that the driving force for silicide formation remains small. A color-map of the ternary Au-Cu-Ag system that divides the alloy composition space into regions according to the optical appearance of the alloys is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> (Supplementary Information). The concentrations of Ag and Cu can be varied according to this ternary color map to design the color of the primary-Au phase, and by extension, the overall color of the MGMC. In principle, one can systematically vary the CIELAB 
 <italic>a*</italic> and 
 <italic>b*</italic> coordinates of the composite overall color by controlling the composition of primary Au-Cu-Ag. For example, it is apparent from Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, that increasing the Ag concentration in the overall alloy raises the CIELAB 
 <italic>b*</italic> coordinate of the primary-Au phase, and enhances the overall yellow appearance of the composite. Using this approach, one may create MGMCs with desirable CIELAB coordinates falling in the category of “yellow” chromaticity. Similarly, reducing the overall Ag concentration in the overall alloy composition will raise the CIELAB 
 <italic>a*</italic> coordinate and drop the 
 <italic>b*</italic> coordinate of the primary-Au phase and overall composite. So doing increases the red chromaticity, and produces an overall composite color falling under the category of “rose gold”.
