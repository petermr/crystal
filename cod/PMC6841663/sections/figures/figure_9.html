 <caption> Results of local structure analysis using ML-LSA and conventional order parameter with ( a) N = 27 (the reference), ( b) N = 4, ( c) N = 8, ( d) N = 12, ( e) local McMillan order parameter T with the parameter d = 3.0 and ( f) local Onsager order parameter S. For N = 27, 17120 of the 62204 mesogens are in nematic-like structures. In contrast to Fig.  8, the classification of local structures was significantly improved. The clear alignments of smectic-like layers of blue-colored particles were visually acquired, while loose parallel alignments of nematic-like layers of red-colored particles were also seen. For N = 4, the four-feature ML model was used based on the results for monodomain systems. The visualized structure contains many small domains that do not correspond to the reference condition. For N = 8, the two-feature ML model was used. The small domains observed with N = 4 are less visible. For N = 12, the one-feature ML model was used. The domain shapes are quite similar to those of the reference structure. The local McMillan order parameter T achieved the adequacy similar to the two feature model with N = 8. The local Onsager order parameter S could not distinguish local structures properly. Definitions of the above order parameters are shown in the Supporting Information. </caption>
