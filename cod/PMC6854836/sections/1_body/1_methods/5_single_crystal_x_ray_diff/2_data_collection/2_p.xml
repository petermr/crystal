 <sup>3</sup>, which was mounted on a micro-loop using perfluorinated polyalkylether. Data were collected on a Bruker SMART diffractometer using a microfocus X-ray source (λ = 0.56087 Å) equipped with mirror-optics and an APEXII charge-coupled device (CCD) detector at room temperature. To resolve the disorder of the structure, data of high resolution and high quality are needed. Intensity data were therefore collected using a total of 14 ω-scans with 360/600 frames per scan and a frame width of 0.5/0.3°. The lower frame width was only used for the maximum 2θ offset. The detector distance was 4 cm, and the detector offsets were 2θ = 0° (6×), 2θ = 34° (3×), and 2θ = 68° (5×). A wide range of exposure times between 3 and 135 s had to be employed, mainly due to the rapid decay of scattering intensity with increasing scattering angle.
