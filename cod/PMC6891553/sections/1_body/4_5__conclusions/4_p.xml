<p>However, more funds are needed to build a battery of sonic crystal acoustic screen prototypes in order to analyze their permeability and acoustic performance in the scaled wind tunnel. At the same time, it seems necessary to improve the scaled wind tunnel in order to obtain better performance, for example, to increase the sand storage capability and analyze the distribution of sand in a higher period of time. In addition, it will be necessary to carry out more studies in free field conditions and to develop powerful simulators to understand and use the mechanisms that generate the increase in attenuation performance due to the accumulation of sand at the base of this kind of screen.</p>
