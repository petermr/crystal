<p id="Par11">Upon the compression above 90 GPa, new reflections appear in the diffraction patterns indicating the occurrence of another phase, coexisting with hurlbutite-III. The structure of this new phase, named hurlbutite-IV, was solved and refined in the 
 <italic>P</italic>-1 space group (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The asymmetric unit of hurlbutite-IV contains four crystallographically independent P, four Be, two Ca and 16 O atoms. The 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic> → 
 <italic>P</italic>-1 phase transition is reconstructive in character and involves rearrangement of the bonding network with the accompanying increase of coordination numbers for all cations. At 89.5 GPa, all P atoms are octahedrally coordinated with the distribution of P–O bond distances varying in the range 1.49-1.77 Å (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Be–O bond distances vary in the range 1.50–1.92 Å for Be1, Be2, and Be3 atoms that are octahedrally coordinated as well. The Be4 atom has five neighboring oxygens within the distance of 1.50–1.81 Å while the sixth Be4–O7 contact is of 2.09 Å. This distribution indicates that the coordination polyhedron of Be4 should better be described as a square pyramid. The geometry of individual P and Be polyhedra is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The dense structure of hurlbutite-IV is built on the TO
 <sub>6</sub> and TO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra sharing common edges. The Ca and O atoms form distorted by stacking faults CCP arrangement, where P and Be atoms are filling octahedral voids and Ca atoms are 12-fold coordinated (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).
