 </xref>A,B, the presence of CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> is evident as the temperature and time increase. Samples are perfectly ordered according to their calcination conditions: in both cases, sample #1 (15 min at 750 째C) is the one with a lower intensity (around 30% less than the higher peak), whereas sample #4 (120 min at 950 째C) shows the maximum intensity. Meanwhile, samples #2 and #3 present intermediate behaviors. Nevertheless, the relative intensity of the sample at 950 째C is higher than that of the one at 750 째C even though the calcination time is longer in the second case. This means that, in this range, temperature seems to have a major impact on the chemical composition than time, i.e., high-purity products can be obtained in fast reactions at high temperatures. According to the conclusions obtained by Khemthong et al.,

 </sup> CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> is mainly formed during the gel combustion, whereas the later calcination processes determine the crystallinity and phase purity. The observed tendency perfectly supports what is expected from a thermodynamic point of view: the chemical reaction between CuO and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> is favored for higher-energy inputs.
