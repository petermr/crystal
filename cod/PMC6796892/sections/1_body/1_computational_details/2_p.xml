 </sup> For simulating XMCD, we have used full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FP-LAPW) method based on density functional theory as implemented in the Wien2k code. The generalized gradient approximation within the PBE scheme was used as the exchange-correlation potential. The muffin tin radii for Pb, V, and O were chosen as 1.66, 2.49, and 1.50 a.u., respectively. The Brillouin zone integration has been carried out with 5000k-points. The energy convergence with a convergence criterion of 10
 <sup>–5</sup> was obtained. The spin–orbit coupling is considered in the calculation. As the ferromagnetic state is a metal, the plasma frequency was first calculated and included in the XMCD calculation.
