<p>To calculate the number density distribution along the direction perpendicular to the interface ρ(
 <italic>z
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>), the system was equally divided into small bins with the width of 0.2 Å along the 
 <italic>
  <bold>z</bold>
 </italic> direction. ρ(
 <italic>z
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) reads
 <disp-formula id="ueq1">
  <graphic xlink:href="ao9b02620_m001" position="anchor" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </disp-formula>where the angle brackets indicate the ensemble average, and

 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>z</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, and Δ
 <italic>V</italic> denote the number of atoms in the 
 <italic>i</italic>th bin, the central position of this bin, and the volume of a bin, respectively. We have tested a few different widths of bin (from 0.2 to 0.6 Å) and have not observed any evident effect on final results.
