<p id="Par5">In this study, we report on an EG formed at the heterointerface between epitaxial CaHfO
 <sub>3</sub> (CHO) and STO. Distinctly different from all the previous ones, we found that this EG can be formed on S-STO, surprisingly, as well as T-STO, and is extremely robust against environments. CHO is a non-polar wide bandgap (~6.2â€‰eV) insulator

 </sup>. From the ionic point of view, the cation valences of CHO is the same as that of STO since in the periodic table of the elements, Ca and Hf, as well as Sr and Ti, are respectively in the same columns. Early studies had shown that the interface between amorphous CHO and STO is metallic
