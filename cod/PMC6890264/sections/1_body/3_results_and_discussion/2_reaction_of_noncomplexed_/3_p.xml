<p>These observations bear similarities with previous reports on hollow nanoparticles, whose formation has been ascribed to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect,
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
 </sup> which involves an imbalance between outward and inward diffusion fluxes during the chemical conversion of a NC into a different material through reaction with a reactant present in solution. The surface of the parent NC is first converted into a shell of the product material by reaction with a species present in solution, after which further conversion can only take place through solid-state diffusion of the reactant species through the NC.

 </sup> In case the outward diffusion rate is faster than the inward diffusion rate, there is a net flow of material going out of the NC, leaving vacancies behind.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
 </sup> Condensation of these vacancies gives rise to voids that eventually collect in a central void in the NCs.

 </sup> Our observations, however, are not consistent with the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, as the cavities form at the surface of the NCs and grow inward, in striking contrast with the outward growing inner voids that characterize the Kirkendall effect.
