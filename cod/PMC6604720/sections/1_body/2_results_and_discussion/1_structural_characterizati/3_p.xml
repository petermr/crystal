<p>The level of doping for Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors produced at 5 min was captured through an annular dark field (ADF) STEM micrograph and the STEM-EELS analysis of the indicated area is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. Elemental composition maps of Y (red) and Eu (green) along with their composites are shown. (Experimental note: The above presented maps are obtained from the Eu M
 <sub>5,4</sub> edges located at 1131 eV and 1161 eV and Y L3,2 edges located at 2080 eV and 2155 eV by using a 1 eV/channel.) The elements Y and Eu exhibit an even distribution throughout the nanoparticle volume with some presence of slightly Eu-rich or Y-rich regions.
