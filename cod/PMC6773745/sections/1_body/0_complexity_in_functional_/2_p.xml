<p id="Par3">Unsurprisingly, the atomic-scale structures of complex materials are difficult to determine. Crystallographic approaches are sensitive to anything periodic; i.e., the ‘average structure’. Local probes provide information about deviations away from this average, but different tools capture different many-body correlations, and so are sensitive to local structure in different ways. However expertly carried out, each individual measurement nonetheless provides an incomplete picture of the true structure. If understanding the function of complex materials truly depends on determining their atomic-scale structures, then the clear challenge is to develop and apply a self-consistent methodology for pulling together these various complementary measurements. This is the long-recognised objective of so-called complex modelling
