<p>NIR bands of melamine remain at relatively similar positions throughout various kinds of samples, unlike its IR bands, which are prone to shifting in response to the chemical environment [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This can be fully confirmed by our conclusions from quantum mechanical calculations. Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] have reported that the most relevant spectral region of milk powder useful for the detection of melamine is 5300–4900 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. This region contains the binary and ternary combinations of NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching with NH
 <sub>2</sub> deformation modes of melamine; however, no overtone bands can be found there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Cantor et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have found that the most meaningful region for the analysis of melamine content in gelatin by IR spectroscopy is at around 800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>; the melamine bands therein stem from

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01402-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, the chemometric models that are based on NIR spectra of gelatin contaminated by melamine have been found to recognize the most the 7000–6500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region. The NIR bands of melamine due to the first overtones and binary combinations of both symmetric and asymmetric NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching modes can be exclusively found there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Our study allows for correcting Haughey et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], who ascribed the NIR region of melamine in the vicinity of 6800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to only overtone bands.
