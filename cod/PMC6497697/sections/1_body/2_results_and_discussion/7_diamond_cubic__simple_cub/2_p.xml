<p>The simple cubic lattice structure has previously been analyzed by others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although without the detail we provide. We have previously studied the 
 <italic>d</italic>-dimensional hypercube forms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Polonium is the only element which takes the simple cubic structure. It is radioactive, which may lead to specialized applications. Here we present the diamond cubic, simple cubic, and decahedral cluster magic formulas.
