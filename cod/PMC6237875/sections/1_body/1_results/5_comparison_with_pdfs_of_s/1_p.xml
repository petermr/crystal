 </sup> and basalt
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, as a function of pressure (see Methods). The PDF of silica glass at low pressure has similarities with the PDFs of crystalline silica phases with tetra-coordinated silicon (close positions of the first four peaks), like coesite-I and especially cristobalite. At pressures around or above 30 GPa, the silica glass PDF changes considerably; it does not look anymore as from phases containing only SiO
 <sub>4</sub> units (like coesite-III), or only octahedra (like stishovite). On the contrary, there are striking similarities in the PDF of glass at 33 GPa and of coesite-IV at about the same pressure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). At higher pressures, at about 60 GPa, the PDF of glass remains to be alike of the PDF of coesite-V containing 3/8 of silicon atoms penta-coordinated, and 5/8—in SiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The PDFs of molten basalt
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup> at ~30 and ~60 GPa possess the same features (maxima and minima) as PDFs of coesite-IV and coesite-V at corresponding pressures. Reported recently
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, PDFs of MgSiO
 <sub>3</sub> glass up to about 110 GPa are significantly different from that of molten basalt
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that compressed pure MgSiO
 <sub>3</sub> glass cannot represent mantle-related liquids. Densities of coesite-IV and coesite-V at a pressure above ∼45 GPa within the uncertainty of measurements coincide with the density of silica glass
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>). These observations are arguments in support of analogous atomic arrangements in compressed silica glass and in coesite-IV or coesite-V. Our results also indicate that (a) silica glass indeed contains SiO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra (and not just a mixture of tetrahedra and octahedra in a certain proportion), and (b) in silica glass, a transition from 4- to 6- coordination may not be over at 60–70 GPa, as suggested previously
