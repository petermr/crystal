<p>In this research, the Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>):Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> luminescent materials were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method at fairly low temperature. The optical properties of synthesized phosphors were investigated as a function of excitation wavelength, temperature, and Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. The given data will include reflection, emission and excitation spectra at room temperature and in 77â€“500 K interval; photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes, quantum efficiencies, luminous efficacies (LE) and CIE 1931 colour coordinates.
