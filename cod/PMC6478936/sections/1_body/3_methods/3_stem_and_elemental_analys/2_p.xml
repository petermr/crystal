<p id="Par32">In order to avoid artefacts during the subsequent STEM-EDX analysis, the particle under investigation was fixed on a laser-cutted supporting structure (H-shaped Ge bar), prepared using a microPREP-laser cutter (3D Micromac AG, Chemnitz, Germany), while being mounted to a Cu half-ring structure. The FIB-based STEM/TEM sample preparation was done with an Auriga 40 crossbeam FIB (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), using a Ga
 <sup>+</sup> beam of 30 keV ion energy for initial thinning followed by a 5 keV polishing step of the lamella until electron transparency at low electron acceleration voltage was achieved. The residual thickness of the sample was identified to be ~100 nm.
