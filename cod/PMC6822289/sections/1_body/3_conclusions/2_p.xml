<p>We show that the computed adsorption isotherms for CO
 <sub>2</sub> are in fair agreement with experiments, allowing for a reliable ranking of these materials for carbon capture. The modular design of our workchain allows for future testing of different force fields and settings, to improve the overall match of simulation with experiments: we believe that this will be possible with the parallel effort of building a consistent repository to collect experimental adsorption measurements.
