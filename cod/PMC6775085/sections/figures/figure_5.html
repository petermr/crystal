 <caption> Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of atomic diffusion on an Al nanowire surface. a (Top) Simulation supercell of necking nanowire with asymmetric tilt grain boundary (GB) on the substrate. Atoms are colored by common neighbor analysis. The green, red, white atoms indicate the face-centered cubic structure, hexagonal close-packed structure, unknown coordination structure, respectively. (Bottom) Schematic diagram of the simulation with temperature gradient. The height of the intermediate region between red and blue regions is 6.3 nm. b Atomic displacement vector in the unit of nm after 10 ns MD simulation. The atomic displacement vector is colored by the magnitude of displacement. c Cross-section view of atomic displacement vector. The atomic displacement vector is colored by axial component. Red and blue arrows indicate the atoms moving upward and downward. Length of displacement vectors is reduced by half of the actual length. The MD results were visualized using OVITO 50 </caption>
