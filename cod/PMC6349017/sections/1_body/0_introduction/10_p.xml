<p>Here, we investigate proton transfer and proton diffusion at the two most prevalent surface facets of ZnO particles, namely ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and ZnO(112[combining macron]0), in contact with a thick liquid water film. The slab models for these two systems are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>. In both cases, the polar ±[0001] directions run parallel to the surface. We will for the first time decipher (i) differences and similarities between the individual PT mechanisms (
 <italic>short-range</italic> proton transfer) and how they relate to the structures of the two surfaces, (ii) to what extent the PT barriers along the polar [0001] and [0001[combining macron]] directions differ, and (iii) whether there are preferred proton diffusion directions along the surface. We will demonstrate that proton diffusion, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, 
 <italic>long-range</italic> proton transport, on ZnO(101[combining macron]0) is “pseudo-one-dimensional” with hardly any diffusion along the polar crystal directions, whereas it is two-dimensional on ZnO(112[combining macron]0), with significant diffusion along both the polar and non-polar crystal directions.
