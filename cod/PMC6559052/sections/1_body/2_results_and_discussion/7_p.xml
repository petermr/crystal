<p>A question arises regarding the interaction between water molecules and the 0.5 ML of substrate not bound to OH. Insight can be garnered from recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on the adsorption of liquid water on the (110) surface of titania, where a similar (2 Ã— 1)-OH overlayer is formed.

 </sup> Under aqueous conditions, the overlayer was found to be stabilized by diffusion of water molecules between the contact and multilayer such that the average occupation of Ti
 <sub>5c</sub> sites adjacent to the adsorbed OH molecules is 0.18 ML over the total length of the simulation. It is likely that the same adsorption/desorption process of the water molecules occurs on the (011) termination. Although partial occupation of water on the substrate is not observed in the (011) and (110) SXRD data, this is expected, given the large associated DW factors and likely relatively low occupancy.
