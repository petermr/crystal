<p>The synthesis of the PetACrONO salts is outlined in 
 <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme 
  <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref>
 </xref>. The ligand PetA was prepared by the NaBH
 <sub>4</sub> reduction of the unsaturated macrocycle 5,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-l,4,8,11 tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,14-diene, as described by Hideg and Lloyd.

 </sup> The dichloro Cr(III) complex 
 <italic>trans</italic>-[Cr(PetA)Cl
 <sub>2</sub>]Cl was prepared by the reaction of PetA and CrCl
 <sub>3</sub>(THF)
 <sub>3</sub> in refluxing dimethylformamide, as described by DeRosa for analogous macrocycles.

 </sup> This procedure gives a mixture of the 
 <italic>cis</italic>- and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-complexes, which was separated by chromatography on silica. For the reaction with PetA, the latter is favored (70% yield) over the less desirable 
 <italic>cis</italic> form (10%), which could be converted to the 
 <italic>trans</italic> form by refluxing in dichloromethane (DCM). The bis(
 <italic>O</italic>-nitrito) complex salt 
 <italic>trans-</italic>[Cr(PetA)(ONO)
 <sub>2</sub>]BF
 <sub>4</sub> was synthesized from 
 <italic>trans</italic>-[Cr(PetA)Cl
 <sub>2</sub>]Cl by procedures modified from those described for the cyclam analogues (
