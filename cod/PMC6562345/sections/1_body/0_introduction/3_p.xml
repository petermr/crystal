<p>There is every reason to expect the phase diagrams of this family of materials to be as rich as those of their inorganic counterparts [
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, because the polyatomic linker anions lend the frameworks greater flexibility, we might anticipate an even greater diversity of phases in the hybrid materials. This phase transition behaviour will depend on fundamentally new physics and chemistry. In contrast with the inorganic perovskites, organic 
 <bold>A</bold>-site cations have a shape—more formally, they may have intrinsic electric dipole or higher-order multipole moments [
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]—which will strongly influence their structure and properties. Similarly, hydrogen bonding between the organic guest cation and anionic framework may dramatically change the relative stability of different structures. These effects have only recently begun to be explored and remain poorly understood. Yet mapping and understanding phase transitions in the hybrid perovskites is both of intrinsic interest from a crystal engineering perspective and of great value for potential applications, as a means to tune these materials' electrical and magnetic properties.
