 <caption> Crystal and electronic structure of WTe 2. ( A) Atomistic model of the T d phase of WTe 2. ( B) XRD θ-2θ scan on a WTe 2 single crystal. Inset shows a zoom-in on the (002) diffraction peak. a.u., arbitrary units. ( C) Temperature-dependent resistance of a WTe 2 sample with a thickness of ~50 nm measured from room temperature to 10 K. Inset shows the optical micrograph of the sample. ( D and E) SdH oscillations of a WTe 2 sample with a thickness of ~30 nm measured at 30 mK (D) and corresponding fast Fourier transform (E). </caption>
