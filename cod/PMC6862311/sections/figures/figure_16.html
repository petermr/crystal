 <caption> ( a, b) Spatially resolved maps, showing the angular positions of the {112} SL reflections of the superlattice (green arrows in ( a)); {111} AL and {200} AL reflections of the atomic lattice (red and blue arrows in ( b); respectively). Single-crystalline domains with a persistent orientation of PbS particles with respect to the superlattice are marked in orange; ( c, d) Experimentally measured ( c) and modelled ( d) cross-correlation functions C ( q 112 S L , q 111 A L , Δ ) are shown by blue and red color, respectively; ( e) Schematic of the mesocrystal unit cell displaying the angular correlation between the atomic lattice (AL) and superlattice (SL); collinear axes are indicated in red (〈100〉 directions) and blue (〈110〉 directions) (Adapted with permission from Zaluzhnyy et al.
