<p>The structural features show that when the transition takes place, the coordination number of each Ge atom changes from three to five. In order to reveal the bonding mode during the phase transition, the bonding profile is directly illustrated through the electron localization function (ELF). The localizations of electrons for different bonding types are noticeably different from each other. For example, the electrons are located between two atoms in a covalent bond, and they are distributed only near the anion in an ionic bond, whereas the electrons are completely delocalized in metal. The electron localization characteristics are revealed with the ELF value. The ELFâ€™s possible range of value is from 0 to 1. The electrons are perfectly localized when the ELF value approaches 1, and they become more delocalized with a lower value [

To gain further insight into the nature of the behavior of the chemical bond characteristics in the phase transition process, the ELF of GeSe at different pressures was investigated in real space. The ELF profiles projected to a layered plane under 0 GPa and 37 GPa are shown in
