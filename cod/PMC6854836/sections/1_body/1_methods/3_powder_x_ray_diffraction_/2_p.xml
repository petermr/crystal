<p>PXRD patterns were collected on two PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometers, using Cu Kα
 <sub>1</sub> and Cu Kα radiation, respectively, at room temperature and in reflection mode. Powder samples were spread onto zero-background Si plates, and the patterns were recorded in 2θ, with a step size of about 0.015° for patterns used for phase analysis and about 0.007° for patterns used for Rietveld refinements. Phase/weight fractions were estimated roughly using the HighScore Plus v3.0e software from Panalytical B.V., together with data from the ICDD PDF-4+ v4.18.0.2 database, or determined more accurately using the Rietveld method through the program package FULLPROF.

 </sup> Typically, the Rietveld refinements proceeded by first modeling the background by linear interpolation using a set of refinable height background points, refining unit cell parameters, and sample displacement together with scale factors, and then fitting Bragg reflection profiles by a pseudo-Voigt function (number 7 in FullProf). Employed structure models were taken from the ICSD database; α-SiB
