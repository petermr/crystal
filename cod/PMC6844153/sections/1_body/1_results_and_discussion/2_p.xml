<p>We compared the band structures of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> with those of Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. The band structures of Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> with dispersion energy correction are shown in

 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. The valence bands of SCACs and bulk are also similar in both Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and in V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>. The contribution of selenium is greater than that of vanadium to the partial density of state both for the bulk and few-chain systems except the double chain (

Screening of inner vanadium ions by outer selenium ions prevents the conduction band from being perturbed by other chains. The interactions between chains mainly change the characteristics related to selenium ions. However, the few V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains have electronic bands with many valleys, whereas the few Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains carry structureless bands.
