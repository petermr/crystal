 <xref rid="chem201902303-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> as percentage of the total d‐populations on the respective atoms. The table also gives the estimated d‐orbital populations from multipole refinement on the DFT‐calculated structure factors (MM‐DFT), as well as from the experimentally obtained structure factors (MM‐Expt). Table 
 <xref rid="chem201902303-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows overall satisfactory agreement between both populations, confirming that the high‐spin state for both Co ions found in the DFT calculations also corresponds to the experiment.
