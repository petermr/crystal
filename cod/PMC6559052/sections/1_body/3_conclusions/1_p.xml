<p>In summary, we have used SXRD to determine the structure of the photocatalytically active TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)/water interface. Our results point to the formation of half-monolayer OH in the contact layer, which causes the substrate to revert to a bulk-like termination from the (2 Ã— 1) reconstruction adopted in UHV. These results compare well with recent experimental and theoretical investigations in the literature and will aid efforts to provide an atomic scale understanding of the enhanced photocatalytic activity displayed by the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011) surface in aqueous environments.
