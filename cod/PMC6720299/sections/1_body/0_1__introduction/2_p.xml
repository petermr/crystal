<p>Raj et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have assessed the creep mechanism of fine-grained polycrystalline NiAl under different creep stages and found that the experimental creep rates are several orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by theoretical models. Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have adopted mechanical alloying and high-temperature hot pressing processes to synthesize NiAl nanocrystalline materials. Their findings show that the strength and plasticity of nanocrystalline NiAl are higher than those of coarse-grained NiAl. However, the plasticity of NiAl is still lower than that of nickel-based superalloys. According to Pal [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-02508" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the plasticity of nanocrystalline metal can be enhanced by further grain refinement near the critical size of 20–25 nm. Therefore, whether the nanocrystalline NiAl fulfills the working requirements by further grain refinement has become a matter of concern. Moreover, the creep process and creep mechanism of nanocrystalline NiAl alloys (grain size ≤10 nm) remains largely unknown.
