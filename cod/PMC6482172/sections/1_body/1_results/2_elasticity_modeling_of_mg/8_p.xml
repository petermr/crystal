<p id="Par22">Again, we focus on the comparison of the elasticity model with the atomistic simulations results on the dissociated O vacancy by manual construction as a function of the jog-jog separation in MgO. The advantage of this comparison is that the elasticity energy differences among configurations with different jog-jog separation distance are independent of the jog self energy. The result of this comparision is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. A reasonable agreement between the elasticity model (including the electrostatic contribution) and the atomistic results (with stress correction) is reached. It is also clear from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> that the elasticity model without the electrostatic contribution gives qualitatively different behavior, thereby suggesting that the long-range Coulombic repulsion helps to drive the dissociation of the vacancy leading to jog formation, which agrees with previous work

 </sup>. In particular, without electrostatics, the model predicts that the jog-jog energy increases with separation, indicating an attraction, while the electrostatic model, after an initial nucleation barrier, predicts an energy that decreases with separation, a result of electrostatic repulsion once the jogs are separated by a significant distance.
