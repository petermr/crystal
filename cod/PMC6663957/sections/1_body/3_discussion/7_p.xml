<p id="Par63">The results from Derenzo phantom (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) show that although normalization can improve the quality of the image for the cylindrical implementation, it still leaves artifacts in the reconstructed image. The normalized Derenzo image reconstructed with the cylindrical model in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c shows a circular artifact.
