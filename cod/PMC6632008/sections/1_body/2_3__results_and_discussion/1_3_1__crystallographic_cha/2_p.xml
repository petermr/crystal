<p>A room temperature study of Sr

 <sub>3−δ</sub> by neutron powder diffraction (NPD) was very useful to investigate fine structural details. Although the XRD pattern can be interpreted in a cubic model, the NPD data suggest the presence of a tetragonal superstructure with a doubled 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis, as 
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> ≈ 
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>c</italic> ≈ 2
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and it was correctly refined in the P4/mmm space group. In this perovskite, the Sr and Ba atoms are distributed at random at 
 <italic>2h</italic> (½, ½, z) sites, Co1 at 
 <italic>1a</italic> (0, 0, 0), Co2 and Ru at 
 <italic>1b</italic> (0, 0, ½), and the three types of oxygen atoms O1 at 
 <italic>2f</italic> (½, 0, 0), O2 at 
 <italic>2g</italic> (0, 0, z) and O3 at 2e (½, 0, ½) sites. The occupancy factors of the three types of oxygen atoms were refined. While O2 and O3 displayed conspicuous deficiency, O1 converged to values close to the stoichiometric value, so the occupancy factor was set to unity. Ru was unambiguously located at Co2 sites, thanks to the contrast between scattering lengths for Co (2.49 fm) 
 <italic>vs</italic> Ru (7.03 fm).
