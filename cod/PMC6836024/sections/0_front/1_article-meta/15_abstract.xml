 <p>In this work the influence of the Ga
  <sup>3+</sup> concentration on the luminescent properties and the abilities of the Y
  <sub>3</sub>Al
  <sub>5−x</sub>Ga
  <sub>x</sub>O
  <sub>12</sub>: V nanocrystals to noncontact temperature sensing were investigated. It was shown that the increase of the Ga
  <sup>3+</sup> amount enables enhancement of V
  <sup>4+</sup> emission intensity in respect to the V
  <sup>3+</sup> and V
  <sup>5+</sup> and thus modify the color of emission. The introduction of Ga
  <sup>3+</sup> ions provides the appearance of the crystallographic sites, suitable for V
  <sup>4+</sup> occupation. Consequently, the increase of V
  <sup>4+</sup> amount facilitates V
  <sup>5+</sup> → V
  <sup>4+</sup> interionic energy transfer throughout the shortening of the distance between interacting ions. The opposite thermal dependence of V
  <sup>4+</sup> and V
  <sup>5+</sup> emission intensities enables to create the bandshape luminescent thermometr of the highest relative sensitivity of V-based luminescent thermometers reported up to date (S
  <sub>max</sub>, 2.64%/°C, for Y
  <sub>3</sub>Al
  <sub>2</sub>Ga
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>12</sub> at 0 °C). An approach of tuning the performance of Y
  <sub>3</sub>Al
  <sub>5−x</sub>Ga
  <sub>x</sub>O
  <sub>12</sub>: V nanocrystals to luminescent temperature sensing, including the spectral response, maximal relative sensitivity and usable temperature range, by the Ga
  <sup>3+</sup> doping was presented and discussed.
