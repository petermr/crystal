<p id="Par27">Further development of SAROM may include the use of visible range lasers. In comparison with near infrared lasers, used in the present study, visible lasers will increase the Raman cross-section and the SAROM spatial resolution. However, the choice of excitation sources should also take into consideration the transparency of material at the excitation wavelength and possible resonance Raman effects which may change the Raman tensor coefficients leading to errors in orientation determination or modifications in Raman tensor analysis
