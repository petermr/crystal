 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) as a function of pressure. Calculated pressure dependence of the interatomic distances (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) and enthalpy of high-pressure phases of hurlbutite (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>) reproduce the experimentally observed sequence of transitions. According to the ab initio simulations, hurlbutite transforms to hurlbutite-II at 58 GPa, while hurlbutite-II to hurlbutite-III at calculated transition pressure of 67.5 GPa (slight underestimation of the transition pressure is typical for DFT calculations employing semilocal functionals, like GGA in our case, see Methods). Interestingly, these two transitions occur without any barrier as a result of relaxation of atomic positions in the unit cell. These three phases correspond to the topologically same enthalpy minimum that evolves with pressure smoothly but in a way that qualitatively modifies the local coordination of atoms in the unit cell at the corresponding transition pressures. On the contrary, calculated atomic configuration of hurlbutite-IV has its own enthalpy minimum, and the transition to this phase is of the first order, in agreement with experimental observation of coexistence of the phases III and IV. In fact, according to calculations hurlbutite-IV is the most thermodynamically stable phase at pressures above 65 GPa. Even though this pressure is most probably somewhat underestimated, it is very close to calculated transition pressure from hurlbutite-II to hurlbutite-III. Thus, theoretical analysis indicates that experimentally observed hurlbutite-III is likely a metastable phase of CaBe
