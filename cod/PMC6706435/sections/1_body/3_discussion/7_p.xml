 </sup>, where in a planar case, the decrease of the grain size leaded to the increase of the receptivity to a detonation and the decrease of the critical layer thickness (the analogue of the critical diameter in a planar case). Results of this work are summarized in Table

 </sub> corresponds to the critical HE layer thickness, the ratio close to 2.5 is higher than the one listed Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, which can be explained by the geometry. The effect of the grain size is even more pronounced in the planar case.
