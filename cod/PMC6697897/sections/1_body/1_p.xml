<p>Understanding the behavior of gasâ€“water interactions in filled ices at high pressures is also crucial for accurate models of planetary interiors. For instance, Titan is expected to have volcanic eruptions of fluid methane, stored in water and ammonia ices (

Methane is also abundant on the giant planets Uranus and Neptune where it was the product of chemical processing of the primordial solar nebula material and then included under the form of ice clathrates during the planetary accretion. In these planets methane and water coexist at pressures from gigapascals (GPa) to hundreds of GPa.
