<p>Indeed, the use of both GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP as reactants results in successful CE reactions even after reaction times much shorter than those used for GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP (1 h instead of 12 h, at the same temperature), as clearly demonstrated by EDS analysis of the product NCs obtained after reaction with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP at 100 °C, which reveals Cu/Ga ratios of 1.00:1.38 and 1.00:1.48, respectively (

 <sub>3</sub>–TPP are partially deformed and exhibit intraparticle contrast in TEM images (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>e, indicated by black arrows), similar to the NCs that reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The NCs that reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP form agglomerates (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.9b05337/suppl_file/nn9b05337_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>, Figure S9), which is likely due to displacement of the original organic capping ligands (dodecanethiol) with DPP during the CE reaction. DPP is a relatively small molecule and thus poorly suitable as a steric stabilizer. In comparison, the NCs cluster less after reaction with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP as triphenylphosphite is bulky enough to provide steric stabilization. To increase the colloidal stability of the NCs reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, oleylamine (OLAM) was added to the reaction mixture and a lower reaction temperature (50 °C) was employed, which indeed inhibited NC agglomeration (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>f). However, under these milder reaction conditions, the Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> exchange proceeds to a lesser extent, as shown by EDS analysis (Cu/Ga ratio of 1.00:0.62, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.9b05337/suppl_file/nn9b05337_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>, Figure S10). The PED pattern (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>e,h) of the NCs reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP corresponds to the wurtzite crystal structure, confirming that Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> CE has indeed taken place. Interestingly, the peaks in the ED pattern are shifted to lower 
 <italic>q</italic> values compared to those of the reference wurtzite CGS, indicating that the product CGS NCs have a larger lattice constant than the reference. This observation will be discussed in more detail below. The PED pattern (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>f,i) of the NCs reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP exhibits broad, poorly defined peaks, indicating that these particles have partially lost their crystallinity during the CE procedure, which precludes a definitive assignment of the crystal structure. The NCs reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP are both smaller than the parent Cu

 <sub>3</sub>–TPP no longer exhibit an LSPR absorption band, whereas those reacted with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP exhibit an LSPR absorption band with a reduced intensity (

 <sup>+</sup> was exchanged for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> to a lesser extent; the presence of an LSPR absorption band thus indicates that these NCs remain cation-deficient, requiring excess holes for charge neutrality.
