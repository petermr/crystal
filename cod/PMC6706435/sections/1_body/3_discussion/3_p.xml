<p id="Par37">Experimental testing of the change of the structure and the grain size at the pressing should be performed using methods of bulk diagnostics, i.e., the tomography. Only the surface is available at the microscopic investigation, where the grains occupy distinguished positions, and the impact of the pressing surface is not identical to the inner stress and to the interaction of grains at the compactification.</p>
