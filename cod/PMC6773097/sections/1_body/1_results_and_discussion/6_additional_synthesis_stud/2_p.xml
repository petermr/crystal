<p>Returning to the theme advanced in the introduction, alicyclic derivatized ring structures provide good guest molecules for the formation of cage‐based zeolites under the right synthetic conditions. The zeolite SSZ‐13 (
 <bold>CHA</bold>) was first discovered with a derivative of the polycyclic hydrocarbon, adamantane.

 <bold>STF</bold>).
 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> The underlying aim in the synthesis was to produce guest molecules that have axes long enough to extend along the channels of a zeolite. This is true for the 
 <italic>anti</italic>,
 <italic>anti</italic> isomeric derivative (isomer I) and, in fact, SSZ‐26 is the only zeolite made with this SDA. However, once both trimethyl ammonium groups have 
 <italic>syn</italic>,
 <italic>syn</italic> configurations (isomer III), it is as though the molecule is beginning to fold in on itself to produce more of a cage structure. This was well‐illustrated in our previous work to produce a triquaternary imidazolium derivative off a central benzene ring, where the imidazolium charged groups folded in on themselves to stabilize the sizable cage of the small pore zeolite 
 <bold>LTA</bold>.
