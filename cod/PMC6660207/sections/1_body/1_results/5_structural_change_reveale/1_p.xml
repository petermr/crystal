<p>Generally, applying high pressure to direct bandgap semiconductors will increase the bandgap, because the binding force to the outer electrons will increase as lattice constant (interatomic distance) decreases. A strong compression usually creates limited energy changes, as distortion and phase transitions always take place. At the same time, the distortion of the lattice and the bending of chemical bonds can seriously disturb the crystal field and disorder the overlap of wave function between atoms in compound semiconductors, making the quantum yield to drop rapidly. Similar results have been reported in traditional III-V and II-VI semiconductors (
