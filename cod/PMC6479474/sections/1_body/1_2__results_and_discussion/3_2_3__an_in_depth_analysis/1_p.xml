<p>Numerous overlapping bands populate NIR spectra of even relatively simple molecules [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This makes their detailed analysis difficult, and the interpretation of the leading contributions is not as straightforward as it is for the corresponding IR spectra. To better elucidate these influences and to present them in a clear manner, we have developed a density map (colormap) of spectral contributions to highlight the modes of interest in a straightforward way (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The color range corresponds to the square rooted intensity ratio of the selected simulated bands to the total intensity of modeled spectrum at any given wavenumber

 <sub>i</sub> and additionally proportionalized to the calculated intensity at that point. The yielded value ranges from 0 (no contribution) to 1 (the NIR spectrum is influenced by the selected mode/modes entirely). The corresponding color varies from black to white, and it may be directly interpreted as the intensity of a given mode at a given wavenumber; the colortable is presented underneath the figure. The square root allows for elucidating less pronounced contributions. The density maps that are determined for various selections of modes-of-interest allow for unequivocal and thorough analysis of the influential determinants in the NIR spectrum of crystalline melamine (
