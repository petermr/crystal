<p>POWGEN is a third-generation design instrument that is an ideal compromise of resolution and intensity to study a wide variety of polycrystalline materials with extremely good resolution and yet a short counting time. The data collection time depends on the mass of the sample, the sample composition and crystallinity, the crystallographic symmetry, and the level of detail that is being sought from the data and can vary from minutes to hours. The versatility of the scientific applications can be appreciated by looking at the more than 400 publications that have resulted from the eight years of operation:

General user proposals are accepted twice a year and a rapid-access mail-in program also exists, where users can request 8â€…h of beamtime for standard experiments using the sample changer:
