<p>The crystal structures and phase purities were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku), with data collected at a scanning speed of 5° min
 <sup>–1</sup> and a scanning angle from 10 to 80°. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra, photoluminescence excitation, fluorescence decay, quantum yield, and CIE spectra of samples were measured using a spectrophotometer (Edinburgh FS5) equipped with a 150 W continuous-wave Xeon lamp as the excitation source. The temperature-dependent PL spectra and LED test were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer (Yuanfangguangdian HAAS-2000 with temperature-increasing accessories TAP-02, Orient-KOJI Instrument Co. Ltd.). The particle morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7800F).
