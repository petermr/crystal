<p>Scanning electron microscopy analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f003">Figure 3</xref>) shows that Mn4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) was formed by particle aggregates small in size compared to Mn8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). When subjected to calcination at 800 Â°C (Mn8), these agglomerates grew uniformly. These agglomerates tended to have a hexagonal plate morphology and had smoother surfaces, which is characteristic of these types of materials. These observations are consistent with the crystal size/temperature increment relation showed by XRD (
