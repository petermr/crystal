<p>There were no spectacular changes in the molecular structure upon increased pressure. Bond lengths obtained experimentally at various pressures were the same within experimental uncertainties (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01107">Table S2 in the Supporting Information</xref>). In the case of theoretical results, there was a tendency for most of them to shorten with pressure, but the shortening did not exceed 0.4% of a bond-length at ambient pressure. The only exception was the carbonyl C=O bond: according to theoretical calculations, its length tends to increase with pressure, possibly due to the increased role of C–H⋯O H-bonds.
