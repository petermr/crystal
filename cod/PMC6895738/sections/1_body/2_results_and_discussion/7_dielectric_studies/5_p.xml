 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) at 450 K probably appears as a result of restructuring associated with the change in the quantitative ratio of the compounds, differing in the thickness of the perovskite layers. The appearance of the maximum in dielectric spectra, which disappears with increasing frequency of the electromagnetic field, and its absence during cooling, is probably due to the fact that water evaporates from the structure of the objects when heated, contributing to the overall picture.
