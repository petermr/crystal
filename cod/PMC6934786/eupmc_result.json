    "Charge transport in organic thin films which are generally polycrystalline is typically limited by the localization of the carriers at lattice defects resulting in low carrier mobilities and carriers move from one state to another state by hopping. However, charge transport in organic semiconductors in their single crystalline phase is coherent due to band conduction and mobilities are not limited by disorder resulting in higher carrier mobility. So it is a challenge to enhance the carrier mobility in a thin film which is the preferred choice for all organic devices. Here, we show that it is possible to increase the carrier mobility in polycrystalline thin films by injecting sufficient carriers such that Fermi level can be moved into the region of high density in Gaussian density of states of molecular solids. When the hopping transport happens through the molecular energy levels whose density is low, mobility is decided by incoherent transport however, when the the hopping transport happens through the energy levels with high density, mobility is decided by coherent transport, as in band conduction. We present results highlighting the observation of both band-like and hopping conduction in polycrystalline organic thin films by varying the concentration of injected charge. More importantly the transition from hopping to band transport is reversible. The observed carrier mobilities in both the regimes match well with theoretical estimates of hopping mobility and band mobility determined from first principles density functional theory."
