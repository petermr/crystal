<p id="Par19">The large increase in pile-up in the helium-implanted material predicted by CPFE agrees very well with the surface height profile measured by AFM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Line plots were made from AFM and CPFE contour plots in the &lt;100&gt; and the &lt;110&gt; directions i.e. direction with minimum and maximum pile-up respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e,f)</xref>). From the line plots, ~172% increase in pile-up height is seen in the &lt;110&gt; direction in the implanted sample. A relatively shallower residual indent impression in the implanted sample is consistent with the observed increase in hardness.
