<p>In the present work, SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs were synthesized in the aqueous solution for the detection of heavy metal ions. Several characterizations were used to confirm the structure and composition of the prepared QDs. The detection of heavy metal ions was completed by using the fluorescence effect of QDs, which is quenched by the ions of Cd
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Pb
 <sup>2+</sup>. The mechanism of fluorescence quenching by the heavy metal ions is discussed in combination with the first principle calculation based on the density function theory.
