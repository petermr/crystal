<p id="Par6">0.0436 g of cobalt nitrate and 1 g of urea were put into a mixture of ethanol and distilled water with a ratio of 2:3 and the solution was stirred to mix well. Then, the solution was moved into a test tube of 20 mL and nickel foam was placed in the solution under water bath equipment with vibration at 80 °C for 90 min. After that, surface of the reacted Ni foam was washed many times using distilled water and ethanol, respectively, and dried overnight in a 60 °C oven. The weight of Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowire was about 1 mg by comparing the weight before Ni foam.
