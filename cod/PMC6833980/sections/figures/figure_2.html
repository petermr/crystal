 <caption> Schematic illustrations of the beam trajectories in a bent plane-parallel crystal for β &lt; 0. ( a) S 1 represents the beam excited when W s = −1. It propagates the longest distance ( x max) in the x direction, reaches the back surface at B 1 and is partly reflected as the beam S 2. S′ 1 represents a beam excited when W s &lt; −1 and S′ 2 the corresponding reflected beam from the back surface. ( b) Beam trajectories to form IFRB and IFTB. IFRB from A 2 are formed by interference between the beam S′ 2 once reflected and the beam S′′ 4 twice reflected from the back surface. IFTB from B′ 2 are formed by interference between the beam S 0 1 reaching directly the back surface and the beam S′′ 3 once reflected from the back surface. ( c) The variation range of the tie point on the dispersion surface for S′ 1 and S′ 2. The range from d 1 to d 2 on branch (1) is for S′ 1 and that from d′ 2 to d′ 1 on branch (2) is for S′ 2. and are the angles of the refracted beams in the BbB and the B3bB modes from the surface, respectively. </caption>
