<p>Piezoelectric material experiences strain when an electrical field is applied to it and develops an internal electric field. The relationship between the electrical and elastic properties of the material can be expressed by the following equations: D = d T + ɛ
 <sup>T</sup> E and S = s
 <sup>E</sup> T + d E Where (
 <italic>D</italic>) is electric flux density or dielectric displacement, (
 <italic>T</italic>) is the mechanical stress, (
 <italic>E</italic>) is the electric field strength, (
 <italic>S</italic>) is the mechanical strain, (
 <italic>d</italic>) is the piezoelectric charge coefficient, (
 <italic>ɛ</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sup>) is the dielectric permittivity for constant T and (
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sup>) is the elastic coefficient for constant E. These small-signal coefficients can be found in the material data table for each material [
