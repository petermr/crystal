<p id="Par12">4. The final step of the algorithm ranks the generated model structures. For the ranking we introduce a numerical criterion, a so-called combined structural error (CSE) (see the full description in Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), which is constructed as an average from the errors related to the nearest neighbor bonds and angles, to the number of predicted interface atoms in specified local conformations, and to the total number of interface atoms. Experimental evidence indicates that the most stable ligand-protected gold and silver clusters also have the most complete steric protection of the metal core by the ligand layers. After ranking, the best model structures can be completed by adding the organic part of the ligand layer and optimizing the atomic structure of the ligand layer by molecular mechanics or molecular dynamics. One possible approach is demonstrated in our previous work
