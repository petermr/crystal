<p>Ternary phases in the Ca–Mg–Ta–N system with different compositions and crystal structures can be easily prepared by a proper tuning of the binary nitride precursors ratio and by using excess amounts of the alkaline earth metal in order to compensate its losses during the high temperature treatments. The extraction of Ca and Mg ions from the ternary nitrides was attempted both by chemically and electrochemically. Oxidation of MgTa

 <sub>4</sub> could not be achieved, with the observed electrochemical capacity arising from parasitic side reactions involving the electrolyte, exacerbated at 100 °C when compared to RT. In contrast, oxidation of Ca

 <sub>2</sub> was found to be possible both chemically and electrochemically. Unfortunately, this process was found to be irreversible. The differences observed in the behavior of Ca and Mg phases cannot easily be rationalized, as the crystal structures are significantly different. According to DFT calculations, the covalent (TaN
