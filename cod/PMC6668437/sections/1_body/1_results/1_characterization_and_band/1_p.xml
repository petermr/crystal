<p id="Par6">In Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1</xref> we present the crystal and electronic structures of both materials as well as some of their basic physical properties. EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> crystallize in I4/mmm and P4/nmm structures, respectively, which are very similar, but with an important difference in mutual arrangement of the basic structural units. EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> has a body-centered and YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> has a primitive tetragonal lattice. Because of this difference the square Bi net (green atoms, Bi2) contains a mirror plane in the former and a glide plane in the latter, and the corresponding symmetry of the perturbing potential drastically alters the pristine dispersions of the states originating from the square Bi nets. In addition, the magnetic moment of Eu ions is considerably larger than that of the Yb ions.
