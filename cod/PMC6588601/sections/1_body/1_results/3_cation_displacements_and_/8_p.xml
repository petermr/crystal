<p id="Par19">Diffuse-scattering simulations using only those Pb atoms that belong to a single variant (out of 8) of the 〈111〉-PNRs could not reproduce the characteristic shapes of the diffuse scattering, which emerged only in the presence of all the variants. This result resonates with the assessment by Takenaka et al.

 </sup>, who attributed the diffuse scattering in PMN to a multidomain state. We investigated the nature of such a multi-domain state by performing an inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the calculated diffuse-scattering amplitude around the Bragg peaks (spherical masks 0.2 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> in diameter were used). Extensive testing using simulated structures demonstrated that IFT successfully recovers regions of correlated displacements and the displacement patterns that underlie specific diffuse-scattering features. The Pb atoms that are associated with the largest variation of the amplitude of the IFT (see Methods) form 3D clusters each composed predominantly of the two 71° 〈111〉-PNRs with nearly all the Pb atoms having

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>); a spatial distribution of these regions resembles that of 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs. For an aggregate of the two equal-volume 71°〈111〉-PNRs, the effective polarization direction is 〈110〉, which is consistent with the anisotropy of the diffuse-scattering distributions. Thus, the much-studied diffuse-scattering features appear to arise from 
 <italic>α</italic>-PNRs, which develop because of the correlated spatial arrangements of 〈111〉-PNRs coupled with concurrent modulation of the displacement-magnitudes.
