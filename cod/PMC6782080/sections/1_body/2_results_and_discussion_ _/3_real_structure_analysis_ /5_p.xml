<p>During the HRTEM investigation, severe beam-damage effects under observation with an unmodified electron dose led to dissipation of the carbon matrix and subsequent release of the specimen into the microscope. Further, the very thin specimens suffered rapid material loss due to electron knock-on damage, as demonstrated by the large void in the centre of the cross section depicted in Fig. 4
