<p>We further tested the device stability and evolution of the electroluminescence. Increased driving voltage does not cause changes in the EL peak position (

 </sup> We also observe red shift of the electroluminescence spectrum (

Such color instability is commonplace in perovskite devices and is caused by halide ion migration during the device operation.

 </sup> In Br/I systems, the halide segregation is readily observed under illumination and without applied electric bias and is commonly assumed to occur under the action of the local electric field induced by free and trapped charge carriers.

 </sup> In the case of electrical charge injection, this effect might be more pronounced because of possible charge imbalance and higher electrical field. While reported EQEs of perovskite LEDs are rapidly increasing, the stability of devices remains a major obstacle. Further studies are required to unveil the factors governing the long-term stability, which may include degradation of the charge-transporting layers or the perovskite layer. We tend to assume that the fundamental issue lies with the facile electrochemical reduction of Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> to metallic Pb. If true, this degradation path should be more pronounced for higher electronegativities of halide, e.g. for chlorides.
