<p>The first ethylene complex K[PtCl
 <sub>3</sub>(C

 <xref rid="anie201909423-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Since then, this type of complexes has enormously gained in importance in chemistry as they are for example, intermediates in a broad range of industrial catalytic processes such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, or hydrosilylation.

The study of such parent HE=EH compounds can clarify the true reactivity and structural behavior of these systems without the distortions induced by sterically demanding substituents in RE=ER, which are usually required in order to stabilize the E=E double bonds.
