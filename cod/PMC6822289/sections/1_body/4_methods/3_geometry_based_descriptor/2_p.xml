 </sup> to be used for the molecular simulation, we adopted a different set of radii, consistently with the force field of the simulation. The frameworks’ atomic diameters were set equal to Lennard-Jones sigma in UFF, and we considered spherical probes with diameters of 3.05 and 3.31 Å for CO
 <sub>2</sub> (oxygen’s sigma in TraPPE) and N
 <sub>2</sub> (nitrogen’s sigma in TraPPE), respectively.
