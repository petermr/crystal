<p>A comparison between three experimental CTRs for the clean surface and water covered interface of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011) is shown in

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>. The black and blue error bars represent the experimental data for the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)-(2 × 1) and TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)/H
 <sub>2</sub>O surfaces, respectively. For ease of comparison, the CTRs for both data sets have been indexed with reference to the (1 × 1) bulk unit cell. Clear qualitative differences can be seen, particularly in the anti-Bragg regions of the [1,1,l] and [−4,0,l] CTRs (as indicated with red lines), where the asymmetrical line shape is no longer present after exposure to H
 <sub>2</sub>O, suggesting more bulk-like relaxation of the surface layers. Furthermore, the FOR intensity, which was observed for TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)-(2 × 1), is not present for TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)/H
 <sub>2</sub>O. This can be construed as a complete absence of the substrate reconstruction (i.e., that it is lifted in the presence of water) or that the domain size has reduced sufficiently to render the intensity of the FORs to background levels. To rigorously test for the presence of (2 × 1) reconstructed domains, refinement of atomic coordinates along with various nonstructural parameters of a model similar to the optimized TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)-(2 × 1) structure was undertaken.
