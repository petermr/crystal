<p>Currently, the proliferation process of carriers in the high electric field region is dominated by Schottky effect (electrode effect) and Poole–Frenkel effect (body effect) [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the charge transport mechanism is dominated by electron jump conductance [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In order to study the change of the conductivity mechanism of the four different density polyethylenes under high field strength at room temperature (25 °C), the mechanism of the above two high field strengths is briefly introduced.
