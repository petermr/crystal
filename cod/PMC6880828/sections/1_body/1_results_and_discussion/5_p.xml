<p>Next, we were interested in the guest binding abilities of cages Pd

 <sub>4</sub> and Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-

 <sub>4</sub>. The tosylate anion was chosen as it has the appropriate size to fit inside the cages. A Job plot analysis revealed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between both cage isomers and OTs
 <sup>−</sup> (Figures S3–S5, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>), which corresponds to the model in which OTs
 <sup>−</sup> serves as a guest molecule which is encapsulated inside the cages [
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR titrations with tetrabutylammonium tosylate revealed that both cages are able to bind OTs
 <sup>−</sup>, showing similar binding strengths (
