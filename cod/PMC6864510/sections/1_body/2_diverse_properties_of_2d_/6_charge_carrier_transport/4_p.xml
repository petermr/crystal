<p>The complex multiphase distribution in quasi‐2D perovskites has caused a controversy of electronic energy band pattern in different optoelectronic devices. For solar cells based on 2D perovskites, the type‐II band alignment is always used (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c). It is described that both the conduction band and valence band have higher energies with a smaller number of 
 <italic>n</italic>, compared with those of larger 
 <italic>n</italic> phase of perovskites. Thus, the electrons transfer from the smaller 
 <italic>n</italic> to the larger 
 <italic>n</italic> domains, while the holes move in the opposite direction. Such a separation of electrons and holes enables efficient solar cells.[qv: 15a] However, the type‐I band alignment is proposed in the LEDs based on quasi‐2D perovskites (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). The conduction band energy is lower when the 
 <italic>n</italic> increases, while the valence band energy is almost the same. In this way, generated electrons and holes can be concentrated into the high‐
 <italic>n</italic> region where charge radiative recombination can be achieved. At the same time, it also effectively inhibits the nonradiative recombination, thus achieving LEDs with high efficiencies.[qv: 15b] In the complex multiphase distribution of quasi‐2D perovskites, the distribution ratio of each phase is often affected by the synthesis process in different laboratories, which may lead to the low reproducibility on the synthesis and structure of materials. This could be the source of the controversy for different device applications.
