<p>As shown in

 </xref>, the absolute PLQY of the NCs reached the minimum value at 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> = 0.47, while it increased as 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> approached both 0 and 1. This result should be due to lattice distortion induced by the difference between the ionic radii of Br
 <sup>–</sup> and I
 <sup>–</sup>. The PLQY decreased with the formation of lattice defects that caused nonradiative recombination; therefore, relaxation of the distorted lattice would enhance the PLQY. Influence of defects on PLQY is generally discussed by PL decay curves. However, average PL lifetimes of the CsPb(Br

 <sub>3</sub> NCs calculated from the PL decay curves increased from 4.6 to 43.9 ns with increasing

 </sup> Intrinsically, there is a large difference in PL lifetimes of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs and CsPbI
 <sub>3</sub> NCs. The behavior of PLQY in

  <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>
 </xref> therefore could not be related to the PL lifetimes.
