<p>By analyzing the coefficients, it is possible to extract two main conclusions: (i) the calcination temperature (
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) has approximately three times the impact on the chemical composition than the time (
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>), as it was predicted by analyzing the XRD pattern in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>; (ii) the magnitude of the interaction variable (
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>12</sub>) is on the order of magnitude of 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, so, apart from the individual effects, there is a considerable interaction between both variables.
