 </sup>. The development of a comprehensive physical picture is hampered because plutonium is difficult to deal with due to its toxicity, radioactivity, and scarceness, and by strict regulatory restrictions. Theoretical work is likewise arduous because electronic and crystal structures are complex and without counterparts in the periodic table of the elements. Furthermore, the 5f electrons are dominant in plutonium and they tend to correlate in ways that are challenging to predict.
