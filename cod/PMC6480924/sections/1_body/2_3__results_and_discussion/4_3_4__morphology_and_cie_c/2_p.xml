 <sup>3+</sup> (x = 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) phosphors. Under the excitation at 453 nm, the CIE coordinates of Bi

 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor were calculated and dropped in the green-yellow light region. The CIE coordinate point gradually shifted to the yellow light region with increasing Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. The PL quantum yields of the selected samples Bi

 <sup>3+</sup> (x = 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01) under excitation at 453 nm were measured to be 35.4%, 30.8%, 24.9%, and 25.1%. Although the quantum efficiency values of BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors were still lower than those of commercial phosphors, they could be increased through purification, surface coating treatment, or doping with other rare earth elements (e.g., Sm, Y, Li, and Bi) prior to further commercial applications [

It can be seen that the fabricated w-LED device could emit white light, combining with a blue light chip and some red phosphors. All these results indicate the BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors have good thermal stability, green-yellow spectrum, and light luminescence efficiency, which indicates that BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> can be used as a green-yellow phosphor material and widely used in blue-light-based w-LEDs.
