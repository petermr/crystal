<p>BET measurements were performed on the three samples. Sw surfaces extracted from BET are 12.25, 64.55 and 155.45 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g for the yellow, the black and the blue samples, respectively. Calculation of the crystallite size was performed considering in first approximation that (i) the whole surface of the crystallite is accessible, (ii) all the crystallites have a spherical shape and (iii) all the crystallites have a same diameter. The crystallite diameter is deduced from the expression: Sw = 6 Ã— (WO
 <sub>3</sub>)/D, with Sw the specific area of the compound, (WO
 <sub>3</sub>) the oxide density and D the crystallite diameter. The crystallites diameters D calculated for the yellow, the black and the blue samples are equal to 68.4, 13 and 5.4 nm, respectively. This result is in perfect agreement with the TEM photographs.
