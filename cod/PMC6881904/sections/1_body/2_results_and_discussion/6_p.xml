<p>To optimize the Na

 <sup>3+</sup>, a series of emission spectra were recorded under excitation of 420 nm, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>c. The emission intensity of 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) → 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> increases to a maximum until an elevated concentration of 60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> and then decreases obviously because of the concentration quenching effect. Such an effect mainly results from the energy consumption via energy migration over Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> sublattice sites and finally to the quenching sites, like impurities/defects particularly as the higher Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration in Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub> makes the Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>-to-Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> interatomic distance much smaller.

 <sup>3+</sup> exhibits about 5-fold enhancement. The QY value was measured to be 75 ± 5% under excitation of 420 nm, which is comparable to the QY value ∼68% reported by Torchia et al.

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>c show the distinct red-shift from 715 to 745 nm, which would benefit the color component manipulation according to the varied specific applications like in phototherapy and/or photomorphogenesis. The red-shift results from the perturbation effects of crystal field strength on the 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) spin-allowed state of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> with increasing Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration in Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>. Generally, the crystal field strength (
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>q</italic>

 <sub>6</sub> by substituting Al
 <sup>3+</sup> sites (radius ∼0.535 Å) will lead to a longer

 <italic>D
  <sub>q</sub>

 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) spin-allowed state of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>. Besides, by greatly increasing Cr

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
