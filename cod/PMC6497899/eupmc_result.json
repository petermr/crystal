    "Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), due to their high quantum yield (QY), tunable bandgap, and simple preparation. However, the red-emitting perovskite QDs are usually containing iodine (I), which is not stable under continuous light irradiation. Herein, perovskite-based WLED is fabricated by lead-free bismuth (Bi)-doped inorganic perovskites Cs2SnCl6 and less-lead Mn-doped CsPbCl3 QDs, which emits white light with color coordinates of (0.334, 0.297). The Bi-doped Cs2SnCl6 and Mn-doped CsPbCl3 QDs both show excellent stability when kept in the ambient air. As benefits from this desired characteristic, the as-prepared WLED shows excellent stability along with operating time. These results can promote the application of inorganic perovskite QDs in the field of WLEDs."
