<p>The preclinical success of LB-100 argues that the PPP-family of phosphatases can indeed be targeted for the development of new antitumor drugs. However, it also brings up the question of which phosphatase(s) should be targeted. In addition to LB-100, other PPP-family inhibitors with antitumor activity include fostriecin, tautomycetin, tautomycin, and cantharidin [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All of these inhibitors are natural products, and they each inhibit PP2AC. However, to many, targeting PP2AC appears counterintuitive in the respect that several studies indicate PP2AC acts as a tumor suppressor. The role of PP2AC as a tumor suppressor originates from studies revealing that both Simian Virus 40 small T antigen and murine polyomavirus middle T antigen inhibit PP2AC, as part of the process by which they transform epithelial cells [

 <italic>i.e.</italic> SET/I2PP2A and CIP2A) were shown to act as natural suppressors of PP2AC activity [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These observations argue that increasing, not inhibiting PP2AC activity, could circumvent tumor formation or progression. A counterpoint to this argument is that the genetic disruption of either

 <italic>PPP2CB</italic> expression in mice results in early embryonic lethality. This observation indirectly supports the concept that inhibition of PPP2CA/B could have cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.
