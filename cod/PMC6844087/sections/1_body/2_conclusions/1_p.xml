<p>In this work, copper ferrite nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by means of a simple polymer-assisted solâ€“gel method. The process and the conditions have been described, and the process has been studied in a wide range of conditions. A multivariate analysis, by means of the design of experiments approach, has allowed us to do a multivariable analysis of the effect of the calcination time and temperature on the nanoparticle properties. Furthermore, it has been proved a higher agglomeration of particles for stronger calcinations.</p>
