<p id="Par20">The change in the directionality of the droplets was investigated by manual z-tracking (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). We found that the droplets reorient in a direction characterized by the angle 
 <italic>θ</italic> that defines a cone of probability for the reorientation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Larger values of the number of spiral turns 
 <italic>N</italic>, measured at the moment of chiral inversion, are associated with larger reorientation angles 
 <italic>θ</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). The precession angle between the path of the helical trajectory and the droplet axis also increases with 
 <italic>N</italic>, and this affects both the radius R and pitch P of the helical trajectory during steady motion (as seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Hence, we argue that the increase of precession angle with 
 <italic>N</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) is also key to define the reorientation angle, when the angular velocity reverts instantaneously. This understanding is in line with the key role played by precession angles in the swimming behavior of unicellular organisms
