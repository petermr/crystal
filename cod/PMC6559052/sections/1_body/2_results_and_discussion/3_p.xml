<p>First, we consider the structural model resulting from DFT + 
 <italic>U</italic> calculations in this work (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b04383/suppl_file/jp9b04383_si_003.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S2</ext-link>) for hydroxyls bound to every Ti
 <sub>5c</sub> site. The best χ
 <sup>2</sup> achieved (4.10) suggests poor agreement between experiment and this structure. This was found to be due to the relatively large atomic relaxations of Ti(1) and Ti(2) induced by the adsorption of OH forming “tight” bonds with Ti
 <sub>5c</sub> sites, when a monolayer coverage is assumed. When considering a model in which alternate Ti
 <sub>5c</sub> sites are occupied

 </sup> where the large displacements of surface titanium atoms are suppressed (

 </xref>), a χ
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.83 is achieved, which is indicative of excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated data (

A total of 93 parameters were optimized during the structure refinement process, incorporating 78 atomic displacements, 10 Debye Waller (DW) factors, a scale factor, a surface roughness parameter, a surface fraction parameter, and 2 occupancy parameters—one for the (2 × 1) reconstructed domain and one for the adsorbate. The surface fraction parameter confirmed that the entire surface adopts the structure obtained in this analysis. The optimum roughness parameter was β = 0.15, increasing from β = 0.09 for the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)-(2 × 1) structure. This is believed to be due to a combination of the change in the substrate termination and a manifestation of the dynamic nature of the water overlayer.

 </sup> It should be noted that the presence of ordered water molecules in contact with the substrate or above the OH contact layer was tested for during data analysis. However, unlike the (110) surface of titania,
