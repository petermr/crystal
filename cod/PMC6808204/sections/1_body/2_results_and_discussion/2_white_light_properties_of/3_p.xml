<p>So far, we have investigated the white-light properties of WLEDs comprised of drop-cast PVP/N-CDot composite films with and without red phosphor. In addition to preparing PVP/N-CDot composite films via drop-casting, one can also produce PVP/N-CDot composite fibers via electrospinning. The electrospinning technique is a well-known and facile procedure that leads to the formation of thin fibers by applying a high potential difference between the nozzle of a solution container and the associated grounded conductive collector [

The composition of the PVP/N-CDot mixture used to produce the fibers is identical with the one that was drop-cast to yield the PVP/N-CDot composite films. Figure S4 of
