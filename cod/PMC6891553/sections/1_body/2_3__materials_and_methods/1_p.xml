<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the main objective of the work was to measure, in a sandy environment, the acoustic attenuation obtained by different ABs (classics and SCASs) taking into account the sand accumulated at the base of each AB by airflow. The measurement of the amount of sand accumulated was done with SLST to obtain the most accurate values. In order to carry out this work, it was necessary to develop a complex prototype on a scale that allowed, under controlled conditions, the dragging of the sand by means of airflows, the subsequent measurements of its accumulation at the bottom part of the different ABs designed, and finally the acoustic evaluation of each prototype tested under the different conditions of sand accumulation.</p>
