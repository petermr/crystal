<p>Second, the Fermi level is located almost exactly in the center of a pseudo‐gap, again in contrast to a typical clathrate‐like DOS. Such a situation may arise if “anti‐bonding” states change character because of lone‐pair‐like configurations (“non‐bonding” states) or direct (multi‐center) interactions between silicon and magnesium (bonding states). In line with this picture, the integration of the electronic DOS in the window between −0.62 eV (first dip in the DOS below 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub>) and the Fermi level yielded quite precisely two electrons per formula unit. These findings of the DOS analysis were used as the starting point for a detailed study of the chemical bonding in MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> by positional‐space quantum‐chemical techniques.
