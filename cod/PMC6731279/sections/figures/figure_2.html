 <caption> Electrical transport properties of CaHfO 3/SrTiO 3 (CHO/STO) heterointerfaces. a, b Temperature dependence of R sheet for the as-grown CHO of various thicknesses grown on TiO 2-terminated STO (T-STO) and SrO-terminated STO (S-STO), respectively. The same samples were post-annealed ex situ in O 2, and the corresponding results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. c, d Temperature dependence of R sheet for the in situ annealed CHO (8 uc) grown on T-STO and S-STO, respectively. Each curve represents a sample that has been annealed in situ under P(O 2) = 200 mbar, at the conditions as labeled. More in situ annealing results on samples of different thicknesses are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7. e, f Temperature dependence of R sheet for the ex situ annealed CHO (8 uc) grown on T-STO and S-STO, respectively. In each case, one as-grown sample was annealed ex situ subsequently from low to high annealing temperature, under P(O 2) = 1 bar, in a tube furnace. For clarity, double-logarithmic coordinates were used in a– d, and semi-logarithmic coordinates were used in e, f </caption>
