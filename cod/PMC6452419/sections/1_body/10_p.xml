<p>At ambient pressure, DORI captures a rich network of noncovalent interactions around a single BCA molecule (see 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>) and distinguishes between CH···O interactions, pseudo π–π stacks, and hydrogen contacts. The seven nonredundant CH···O interactions experimentally characterized in the BCA crystal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>
 </sup> are reflected by the directional DORI domains (see red basins in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>), typical for hydrogen bonding.

Many nondirectional van der Waals regions that span all around each BCA at ambient and high pressure are also clearly visible in blue. The monitoring of this noncovalent network upon compression discloses which interactions cause the largest changes in the covalent bonding patterns.
