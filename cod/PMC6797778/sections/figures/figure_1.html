 <caption> ( a) Stacking-dependent spontaneous polarization of bilayer 3R MoS 2. ( b) Energy of the bilayer structure depending on the stacking sequence. Φ NEB is the ferroelectric switching barrier calculated from the NEB method. ( c) Displacement patterns of the interlayer shear mode ( Q LS ) and the infrared mode ( Q I R ) mode along the in-plane polarization direction r. ( d) Phonon dispersion of the bilayer 3R MoS 2.The zone-center Q LS mode at 0.6 THz and Q IR mode at 11.4 THz are denoted by arrows. </caption>
