<p>An elemental chemical analysis for the determination of K and Mn was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, PERKIN ELMER, model 3110, (Perkin Elmer Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) and by using a standard procedure for sample digestion. The sample digestion process consisted of dissolving 100.0 mg of sample powder in 2.0 mL of 37% HCl and 1.0 mL of distilled and deionized water (DDW). The sample was then heated up to 100 °C, for about 30 min, until the solution became transparent and there were no undissolved solid particles. The Mn and K contents were determined at wavelengths of 279.5 and 766.5 nm, respectively. The average oxidation states (AOSs) of the manganese in the samples were determined by potentiometric and colorimetric titration [

 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, the pH of the solution was adjusted to between 6.5–7.0, and then it was titrated with KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> standard (around 1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> M). The final point for this titration was taken when the potential increased to more than 100–150 mV. In the second step, about 40 mg of sample was dissolved in 10.0 mL of ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) solution under constant nitrogen flow, and the volume was adjusted up to 100 mL with DDW in order to reduce Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> and Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> to Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>. For the final step, 10.0 mL of this solution was back titrated, with a permanganate standard, until a color change occurred. All measurements were repeated three times in order to obtain the standard deviation.
