<p>The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was measured by dilatometric analysis, in order to determine the mechanical compatibility of the material with the components of the cell. The analysis was carried out between 400 and 900 °C for several cycles and the data were collected only during the heating runs.

 <sub>3−δ</sub>, which is approximately linear in the considered temperature range, and does not display discontinuities that could suggest decompositions. The TEC parameter, measured in air between 400 and 850 °C, is also shown. The determined value of TEC for the prepared oxide is substantially higher than those that normally have the components of the cell, but it is typical for cobaltites, which have been successfully used as cathodes in SOFC. In fact, the porous nature of the electrode once it is deposited on the electrolyte is able to accommodate the excessive dilation upon heating, avoiding cracking problems or delamination from the electrolyte.
