 </sup>. The band structure calculations have been carried out in Brillouin zone connecting the different high symmetry points, X, M, Y, Z with the internal coordinates being (0, 0, 0), (0.5, 0, 0), (0.5, 0.5, 0), (0, 0.5, 0) and (0, 0, 0.5) in units of (2

 <italic>a</italic>; 2

 <italic>b</italic>; 2
 <italic>π</italic>/

 </sup>. This is a common drawback of DFT however, it does not affect the accuracy of transport parameters estimated from band structure because, transport parameters are estimated from the slope of the valence or conduction band and not from the band gap.
