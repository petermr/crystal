<p>In the observation of IFRB, there is another possible blurring effect caused by the different travelling directions between the beams in the BbB and the B3bB modes. The difference in the directions of these two beams is approximately 300 nrad. As the distance from the sample to the nuclear plate is 100 mm, the resultant difference in the arriving positions on the plate is 30 nm. This difference is much smaller than a period of the IFTB of 0.3 mm and the blurring effect is negligible. A similar blurring effect is expected in the observation of IFMRB and IFTB. This is also negligible in the present setup.</p>
