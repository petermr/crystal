<p>Conventional three-electrode cells were employed for the electrochemical measurement. The composite/thin film electrodes were used as the working electrodes. The counter electrode was a platinum or magnesium foil. The reference electrode had a silver wire immersed in 0.05 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>(Wako) in acetonitrile: AN (Kishida) solution with two liquid junctions with microporous glass membranes to avoid contamination of the Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ion into the electrolyte solution. A 1.0 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide:Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> in AN solution (Kishida) was used as the electrolyte solution. We also prepared glyme-based electrolyte solutions. The Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> salt (Kishida) was vacuum dried at 170°C for 8 h. The glyme-based solvents monoglyme: G1 (Kishida) and butylmethyltriglyme:BuMeG3 (Wako) were dried over activated molecular sieve (5A) for 36 h until the water content reaches &lt; 15 ppm. Subsequently the Mg(TFSA)
 <sub>2</sub> was dissolved in the solvents to use as the electrolyte solutions. The water content of the solvents and solutions were measured by Karl Fischer titration method (Mitsubishi Chemical Analytics).
