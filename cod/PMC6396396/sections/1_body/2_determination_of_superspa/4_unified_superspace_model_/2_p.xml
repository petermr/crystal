<p>A unified superspace model without Al/Si ordering was suggested by Klar 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2017
 <italic>a</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb37"> ▸</xref>) for the range 0 ≤ 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.5. Combining this suggested model with the approach of Section 3.2
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.2"/> and the comparison of this section allows us to define the occupational modulation parameters as a function of the vacancy concentration 
 <italic>x</italic>. Thus, a unified superspace model is established assuming that there is a unique ideal Al/Si ordering pattern describing mullite with 0 ≤ 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.5.
