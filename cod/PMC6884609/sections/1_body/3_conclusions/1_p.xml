<p id="Par24">In summary, the shape evolution of bcc Fe nanoplates with low-index surfaces was investigated by MD simulations. The discrepancy in structural stability leads to diverse patterns in morphology transformations. (110) nanoplate is the most stable and keeps its initial configuration until the highest temperature. By contrast, (111) and (001) nanoplates are not able to firmly exist, both of them tend to collapse into irregular particles even below the room temperature. However, prior to this final collapse, the surface of (001) nanoplate converts into (110) facets with different orientations and meanwhile forms a saddle shape, which maintains in a relatively broad temperature range. This transformation process is driven by the shear stress, whose distribution is closely associated with the facet arrangement. Further bending and buckling during the subsequent heating correspond to the stress release. Moreover, simulations were performed on the modulated (110) nanoplate, (001) nanoplates with different diameters and thicknesses, and other bcc metallic (001) nanoplates. The results show that the shape evolution can be tuned by facet orientations, plate sizes, and components. This study discloses the atomic-level mechanism of shape evolution of bcc metallic nanoplates andÂ thus provides a theoretical basis on the morphology controlling in syntheses of metallic nanomaterials.</p>
