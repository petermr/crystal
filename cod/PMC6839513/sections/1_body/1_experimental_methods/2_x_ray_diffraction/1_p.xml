<p>Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was performed at the XRD1 beamline at the synchrotron ELETTRA (Trieste, Italy). In these experiments, the bending magnet radiation was monochromatized to a wavelength of 0.14 nm and guided through slits before interacting with the sample. The sample was mounted on a κ-goniometer and fixed with a custom-made vacuum holder which allowed in addition to level the sample surface with respect to the beam. A Pilatus 2 M detector (Dectris, Switzerland) collected the diffracted intensity. The blind detector areas due to detector construction are eliminated to a certain extent by taking images at slightly different detector positions. A self-written software, GIDVis,
