<p id="Par13">After heat treatment, the Ti, Ni, and Cu peak heights were all reduced to a large extent, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, suggesting that a significant amount of interdiffusion has occurred in the Ti
 <sub>75</sub>Ni
 <sub>15</sub>Cu
 <sub>10</sub> multilayered thin film. The range of Ti ions was reduced, confirming the distinct diffusion of Ti in the reacting layers. The distribution of Ni and Cu was almost flat, indicating that they are well mixed during annealing. In the meantime, Ti diffused rapidly and passed through the Ti/Ni and Ni/Cu interfaces. The Ni peak was slightly leaning to the Cu layer, while the peak position of Cu was almost unchanged. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, the Ti peak in the Ti
 <sub>10</sub>Ni
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>40</sub> multilayered film was broadened and shifted towards the Cu layer after heat treatment. Overall, the distribution of Ti changed the most in both multilayered thin films, as a result of the fast diffusion in the solid-state reaction. The peak positions of Ni and Cu both moved to the Ti/Ni and Ti/Cu interface. Unlike Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the amplitude of the Ni and Cu curves became larger. Therefore, under the current experimental condition, the stack was not completely mixed in the depth direction.
