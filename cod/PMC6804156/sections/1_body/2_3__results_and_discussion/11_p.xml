<p>The normalized emission spectra (Î»
 <sub>ex</sub> = 393.5 nm) of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) sample recorded at 77 and 500 K are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. These spectra consist of the same five sets of emission lines as spectra recorded at room temperature (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The only difference between emission spectra recorded at 77 and 500 K is increased broadening of the lines at higher temperatures. This phenomenon can be attributed to the increased lattice vibrations at elevated temperatures which leads to distortion of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> local surrounding. This results in Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> emission at slightly different wavelengths; hence, the broader emission lines.
