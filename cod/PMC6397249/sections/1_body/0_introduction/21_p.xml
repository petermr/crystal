<p id="Par22">In conclusion, a concept is introduced for designing color in polychromatic metallic glass-forming alloy systems with large lattice mismatch. The concept relies on forming composites consisting of a metallic glass matrix and finely dispersed gold microdendrites (MGMCs), with the matrix and dendrites being of dissimilar color but the composite displaying an overall visually-unresolved average color. Here we exploit the large lattice mismatch and broad chromaticity range in the Au-Si metallic glass-forming system to design a series of Au-based MGMCs. The developed MGMCs display uniform overall yellow colors within a broad chromaticity range and high overall hardness. The approach may potentially be expanded to other polychromatic metal alloy systems, leading to a new generation of metals that combine advanced performance with cosmetic attributes.</p>
