 </xref>) reveals that no negative values of the wavenumbers are evident for these sulfides. Because the presence of negative values of the phonon frequencies is typically indicative of a dynamic instability for a given material,

 <sub>f</sub> (M

 <sub>31</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu) implies that the tendency to form the metal-deficient sulfide is rather influenced by subtle effects in the electronic (band) structures. An inspection of the phonon densities-of-states for the zirconium-containing sulfides, i.e., ZrS and Zr
 <sub>29</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>), shows that imaginary wavenumbers are evident for both sulfides, which, accordingly, should be dynamically unstable. Note that the phonon frequencies in ZrS correspond to more negative values than those in the zirconium-deficient Zr
 <sub>29</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub>. This outcome suggests that the incorporation of zirconium vacancies may alleviate the dynamic instability. In this context, it is also remarkable that the experimentally determined phase width of the zirconium sulfide spans a more metal-deficient existence range relative to the remaining sulfides (see above).
