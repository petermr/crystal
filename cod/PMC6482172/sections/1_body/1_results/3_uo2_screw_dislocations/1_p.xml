<p id="Par23">Finally, to understand the generality of the dissociated vacancy mechanism, we consider the case of a screw dislocation in UO
 <sub>2</sub>. UO
 <sub>2</sub> is the most commonly used fuel in light-water nuclear reactors. Further, UO
 <sub>2</sub> is isostructural with other important fluorite-structured oxides, including PuO
 <sub>2</sub>, ThO
 <sub>2</sub>, and CeO
 <sub>2</sub>, the latter being an important material for the study of solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen transport. Thus, the behavior of defects at dislocations in CeO
