<p>It can be clearly observed that a lower growth rate does not favor the growth of nanopillars even though particles have more time to hop over the surface to find their own species. It is expected that the formation of the pillars depends on the islands that are formed in the initial stage of growth.

 </sup> The diffusion length of the two components plays a critical role in the resulting island size

 </disp-formula>where ν is the diffusion attempt frequency, 
 <italic>a</italic> is the characteristic jump distance, and 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> is the activation energy for diffusion. At low frequencies, the long LMO diffusion length leads to the growth of a few larger islands. For higher frequencies, the diffusion length rapidly drops, resulting in the growth of many smaller islands on the surface. For such higher frequencies, the diffusion length of both LMO and LLTO species becomes comparable, and vertically aligned structures are formed. This limits the pillar diameter to about 90 nm for VAN growth at higher frequencies, in good agreement with experimental results in previous studies.
