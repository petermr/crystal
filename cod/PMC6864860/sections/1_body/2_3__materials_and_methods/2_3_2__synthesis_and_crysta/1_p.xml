<p>PROG-CNA: Progesterone (314.5 mg, 1.0 mmol) and an equal stoichiometric quantity of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (172.6 mg, 1.0 mmol) were placed in a clear and dry glass vial. The solvent EtOH/water (1:1,

 <italic>v</italic>) was added dropwise and the solution was mixed until the solid compounds dissolved completely. The glass vial was closed by using a serum cap with pinholes to allow the slow evaporation of the solvent. After 7 days, colorless block-like crystals could be observed. A sample of dimensions 0.05 × 0.04 × 0.03 mm was selected upon which to perform a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) analysis.
