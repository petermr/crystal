 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> illustrate individual PT events, but give no information about if such PT events can be concatenated to yield Grotthuss-like diffusion of the PHC along the surface. In order to explore proton hole diffusion, we followed the positions of the individual PHCs in time and calculated the mean squared displacement projected onto the two primary surface crystal directions (±[12[combining macron]10] and ±[0001] for ZnO(101[combining macron]0), and ±[11[combining macron]00] and ±[0001] for ZnO(112[combining macron]0)). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> shows the calculated mean squared displacements and some example trajectories of the PHCs.
