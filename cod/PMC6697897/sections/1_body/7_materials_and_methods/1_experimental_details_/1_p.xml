 <sub>4</sub> clathrate samples were prepared using the well-established method described in ref. 
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. For Raman measurements, samples were loaded cold and compressed in a diamond anvil cell to have enough pressure to stabilize the sample at room temperature. All spectra were measured at room temperature, upon increasing pressure in small steps. Further details on sample preparation, Raman measurements, and analysis are given in
