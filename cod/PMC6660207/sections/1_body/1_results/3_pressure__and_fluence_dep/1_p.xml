<p>At each pressure, we monitored the dependence of PL intensity on excitation laser power. A typical experiment at 2.7 GPa is shown in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, where the PL intensity increases linearly with increasing laser power. 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> shows the power-dependent intensity of all pressures. We can see that in the pressure range less than 3.5 GPa, the photon counts are high and nearly the same. A sudden drop occurs when the pressure exceeds 4 GPa. All the traces can be well fitted by 
 <italic>I</italic> = α
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>W</sub>, where 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>W</sub> is the excitation laser power and α is the intensity coefficient. α is plotted as a function of pressure in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> (blue square). It is nearly constant at first, suggesting that the light-emitting efficiency is unmodified by pressure. However, α drops sharply when the crystal encounters a pressure range greater than 4 GPa, indicating a very poor emission efficiency.
