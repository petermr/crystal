<p id="Par5">In this work, we propose and demonstrate a thermomigration-based method to controllably grow metallic nanowires such as Al, Cu, Ag, and Sn, directly from the surface of a hot solid by simply drawing a cold tip back after touching. Our proposed method combines the advantages of the traditional Czochralski method

 </sup> of pulling single crystal out of liquid and conventional metalworking process of wire drawing, to make single-crystal nanowires directly from a solid reservoir without a holed die. Previously, it has been demonstrated that diffusion from free surface into 1D dislocation and GB can lead to superplasticity
