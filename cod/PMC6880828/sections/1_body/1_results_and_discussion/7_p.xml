<p>Subsequently, the photochemical and thermal isomerizations of cages Pd

 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> and Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> were followed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Irradiation of Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable

 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> in a CD
 <sub>3</sub>CN/CD
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> 1:1 mixture at 312 nm at −70 °C was performed to isomerize ligand stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> to unstable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> (vide infra), followed by allowing the sample to warm to room temperature to form stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>i). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of this newly formed complex is identical to the spectrum of Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> prepared directly from 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>ii), showing that cage Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> is effectively converted to Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub>. An intermediate complex containing unstable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> ligands was not observed, even at low temperatures, most likely due to the low barrier for THI of this isomer. Conversion of cage Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> to Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> by photochemical 
 <italic>E</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic> isomerization of ligand stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> to unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> was performed by irradiation of a sample of Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> at 312 nm at −20 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>v). Signals of cage Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> disappeared and the formation of a new set of signals was observed. DOSY NMR confirmed the formation of an assembly with a hydrodynamic radius which was similar to that of the cage Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub>. Precipitation of the metal centers in this assembly using tetrabutylammonium glutarate liberates the ligands and they were identified as unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>. Combined, these results confirm that the photogenerated complex is indeed Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub>. Subsequent irradiation of this sample containing Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> at −20 °C at 365 nm converts the unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold> ligands back to stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>, reforming Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(stable 
 <italic>E</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). These experiments highlight the reversible formation of Pd
 <sub>2</sub>(unstable 
 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <bold>1</bold>)
 <sub>4</sub> through photochemical 
 <italic>E</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic> isomerization of the ligands.
