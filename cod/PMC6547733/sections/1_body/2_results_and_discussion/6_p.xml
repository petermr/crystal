<p id="Par15">In order to evaluate the electronic changes associated with electronic excitation and excitation induced structural deformations, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows the modifications of the projected density of states for the monoclinic LTO crystal under 0.8% electronic excitation, without and with excitation induced structural deformations. While Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref> shows the same characteristics than Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref> but to a lesser degree, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> indicates that the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules in the structure, as induced by electronic excitation, tend to reduce the number of O 
 <italic>2p</italic> unoccupied and partially filled states near the Fermi level. The structural distortions also play a role in lowering the energy of unoccupied Ti 
 <italic>3d</italic> states, which contributes to reduce the energy gap between unoccupied O 
 <italic>2p</italic> and Ti 
 <italic>3d</italic> states of the material compared to the pristine monoclinic LTO.
