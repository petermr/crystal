<p id="Par11">The propulsion mechanism can be understood as follows: the solubilization of the liquid crystal by the micelles induces an inhomogeneity of the surfactant at the droplet interface, and consequently an inhomogeneity in the interfacial tension. The resulting gradient in interfacial tension initiates a flow, known as Marangoni flow, which propels the droplet: a larger concentration of surfactant at the front of the droplet combined with a smaller concentration at the rear drag the interfacial fluids from the front to the rear

 </sup>. The motion is sustained by a continuous supply of surfactants from the surrounding. Meanwhile, as the surfactant diffuses at the droplet interface, motion ceases when the shrinking droplet is small enough that the diffusion process dominates over the supply of surfactant and the droplet is finally covered by surfactants homogeneously.
