<p>Greenish‐yellow crystals of the oxohydroxoferrates (yield &gt;99 %) were obtained as plates of various shapes by reacting iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate with a mixture of the respective alkali metal hydroxide and water (
 <italic>q</italic>(K)=1.1 and 
 <italic>q</italic>(Rb/Cs)=0.7) in a PTFE‐lined stainless steel autoclave. The use of a closed autoclave with a PTFE inlet is required due to the corrosivity of the medium and the necessary constant base concentration, although almost no pressure is generated during the reaction.

In air, the crystals of the oxohydroxoferrates quickly decompose to a red powder of an amorphous iron oxo‐compound.
