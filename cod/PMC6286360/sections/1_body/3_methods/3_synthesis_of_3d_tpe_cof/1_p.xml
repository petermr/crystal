<p id="Par16">A Pyrex tube was charged with TAPM (25.5 mg, 0.067 mmol), TPE-Ph-CHO (50 mg, 0.067 mmol), 2.0 mL 
 <italic>o</italic>-dichlorobenzene and 2.0 mL mesitylene. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min, followed by slow addition of 0.6 mL of 6 M aqueous acetic acid. After that, the tube was degassed by three freeze−pump−thaw cycles, sealed under vacuum and then heated at 120 °C for 7 d. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the resulting precipitate was filtered off, exhaustively washed by Soxhlet extractions with tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and dichloromethane for 24 h. The resulting yellow powder was dried at 80 °C under vacuum for overnight to give 3D-TPE-COF in 85% yield. Elemental analysis for the calculated: C, 89.74%; H, 4.96%; N, 5.30%. Found: C, 84.58%; H, 5.28%; N, 4.85 %.
