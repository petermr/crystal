<p>Samples were prepared by placing a diluted dispersion of nanocrystals in toluene in a quartz cuvette with 10 mm path length. Absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 16 UV–vis–NIR spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were measured on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Hamamatsu R5509-72 PMT with a monochromator grated at 1200 nm. A 900 W Xe lamp was used as the excitation source.</p>
