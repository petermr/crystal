<p id="Par37">To investigate the thermal quenching behaviour, the relative photoluminescence intensities of SALON were measured from 298 to 500 K in a Fluoromax 4 spectrophotometer (HORIBA, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. For this purpose, a thin powder layer of SALON was prepared on top of a heating plate equipped with a thermocouple. Temperature dependent emission spectra were collected with a 25 K step size between measurements. Before each measurement, care was taken to ensure thermal equilibrium within the sample.</p>
