 <xref rid="materials-12-00948-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we list all input data that were used in the computation of the drag coefficient below. For the effective Lamé constants of the polycrystal, we have chosen to use the separate experimental values (where available) listed in those tables rather than analytically averaging over the single crystal values. The only exceptions are Mo and Zr due to lack of experimental data, and because the Voigt and Reuss bounds are very close to each other in those cases. In fact, for SOEC of cubic crystals, analytic averaging would be a viable avenue as well (assuming negligible texturing), but not so much for hcp and other crystals, see [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-00948" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and references therein. (The single crystal averages for the Lamé constants of cubic crystals agree well — within a few percent — with the experimental results listed in
