<p>For the synthesis of luminescent CuInS
 <sub>2</sub> (CIS) NCs a protocol reported earlier by Li 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>) was adapted. Briefly, 297 mg of In(Ac)
 <sub>3</sub>, 191 mg of CuI, and 5 mL of DDT were mixed and degassed under vacuum for 1 h at 80 °C. The reaction mixture was then heated under N
 <sub>2</sub> flow to 230 °C and allowed to react for 100 min. The reaction was stopped by removing the heating mantle. The NCs were precipitated with a methanol/butanol 1/1 mixture and, after centrifugation and decanting the supernatant, dispersed in 10 mL of toluene.
