<p>All the 11 systems were shocked with the same speed 
 <italic>V
  <sub>shock</sub>
 </italic> = 9 km/s at a direction perpendicular to the lattice vector. We used this shock wave speed based on a previous classical MD study, in which the breaking of the CL-20 trigger bonds was apparent at this shock speed [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The time step for the 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD simulation was set to be 0.1 fs. As shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, under this shock condition, 10 of the systems (excluding the insensitive explosive TATB) were initiated within 10,000 steps, that is, 1000 fs.
