As can be seen from the creep curve on the right, the tertiary creep stage did not occur during the 200 ps. In the primary creep and steady-state creep stages processes, it can be seen from the left part that the shape of the grains did not change significantly, and atomic diffusion occured only at the grain boundaries, indicating that in this simulation only happened grain boundary diffusion. For Video S2, it is the nanocrystalline NiAl model with a grain size of 4.5 nm at 1400 K under the stress levels of 2.0 GPa. It can be seen from the creep curve on the right, the model entered the tertiary creep stage after 20ps. As can be seen from the left part, the shape of the grains in the model were obviously elongated after 20ps, and the diffusion phenomenon was gradually from the grain boundary extend to the inside of the grains, indicating that grain boundary diffusion and lattice diffusion were existed simultaneously in the tertiary creep stage.
