 <caption> 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of a sample containing both unreacted Si (∼20 wt %) and α-SiB 3– x . The error of the deconvoluted signal contributions is conservatively estimated as 0.35(1), 0.44(1), and 0.21(1). The sample (∼300 mg) was prepared from a reaction mixture nano-Si/B = 1:3 (four pellets with 6 mm diameter), heated at 1240 °C for 24 h. </caption>
