<p>To get insight into the magnetic properties of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, we performed field-dependent magnetization measurements at 2 K with applied magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>A. The field-dependent behavior is characteristic of that of a ferromagnetic material—the magnetic moment of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub> saturates at ∼2.8 T for applied fields perpendicular to the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis and ∼4.1 T for fields parallel to the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. Accordingly, a strong anisotropy of magnetization is observed, with the easy axis in the basal plane, perpendicular to the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. The saturated magnetizations are ∼6.0 μ
 <sub>B</sub>/Eu for both orientations.
