 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> that the SDA can direct the location of Al in aluminosilicates. We have previously observed this for borosilicates, in which B atoms are preferentially located in close proximity to the N
 <sup>+</sup> centre in the SDA.

 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> In SSZ‐27, the SDA appears to be located exclusively in the heart‐shaped cavity, which suggests that the Al is likely to be at the surface of this cavity too. We hypothesize that this means that all the active sites are accessible in the side pockets created by the heart‐shaped cavities, whereas the main straight channels are relatively free of active sites, and this might reduce the potential for blockage.
