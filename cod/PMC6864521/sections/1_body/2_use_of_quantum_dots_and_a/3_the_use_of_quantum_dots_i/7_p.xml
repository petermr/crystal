<p>Recently a QD enhanced active color filter array was proposed to replace conventional color filters. In this array, QDs are printed on top of the LCD panel and work as the down converting material.

This can greatly improve the LC response time and driving voltages. Furthermore, by replacing band pass color filters, which absorb a large portion of light, these emitting color filters can improve the efficiency of LCD devices if they have a high PL QY. Their placement in front of the display panel may also increase the color accuracy at higher viewing angles. At the same time, there are several issues with this approach, as it requires an additional optical filter to reduce backlight leakage and improve the contrast and viewing angle.[qv: 56b] Additionally, the LCD stack must be changed and the QD color filter needs to be placed after the analyzer, requiring some adjustments to the LCD production process.
