<p>Compared with the efficient near‚Äêinfrared, red, and green light LEDs, blue LEDs based on perovskites still have inferior performance. The ways to achieve blue light emission of LEDs are composition engineering and dimensional engineering. In 3D perovskites, Br is replaced by Cl to widen the perovskite bandgap to achieve blue light emission. In dimensional engineering, a reduced dimension enhances the quantum confinement effect, so the PL peak is shifted to blue light.</p>
