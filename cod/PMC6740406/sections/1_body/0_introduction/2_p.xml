<p>In this work, we demonstrate the tuning of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> doping in GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> microphosphors by a high-gravity-assisted reactive precipitation-coupled calcination process. A high-gravity rotating packed bed (RPB) reactor was used as the reactor for the reactive precipitation of precursor of GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, followed by annealing to obtain microphosphors. The crystal structures, morphologies, and element distributions of GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> microparticles were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The optical properties including luminescence spectra and luminescence quantum yields under excitation of near-ultraviolet (NUV) light were analyzed. The particles obtained by using conversional stirred tank reactors (STR) were adopted for comparison study. The LED devices fabricated by the GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> microphosphors and NUV chips showed bright red emission, promising for applications in the next generation of semiconductor lighting.
