<p id="Par13">Obviously, it is instructive to take the data along the cut, which contains these special momentum regions. The next panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> (cut #3) represents a crucial dataset, which underlines the exotic electronic structure of YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> and directly proves the presence of the doubly (not quarterly) degenerate Dirac points, i.e., the long sought Weyl points. The first striking observation is that the Bi dispersions appear to be non-spin-degenerate in this particular region of the BZ. This breaking of the spin-degeneracy is key, and is not consistent with the AFM calculations. Indeed, the dispersion is seen to split between 100 and 200 meV binding energy and only one pair of split features is gapped while the other still reaches the Fermi level where they clearly cross. It is these crossing points sitting at the Fermi level are the essential components of the electronic structure of a Weyl semimetal. Since these points are also the places where the electron-like FS touches the hole-like FS, YbMnBi2 is a canonical example of type-II Weyl semimetal
