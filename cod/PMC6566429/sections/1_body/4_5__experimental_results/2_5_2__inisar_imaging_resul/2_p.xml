<p>The ISAR imaging results after signal calibration with a small rotation angle (about 4째) of three received channels are shown as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f010">Figure 10</xref>. All the ISAR images are displayed in log-magnitude and the dynamic range is 25 dB. We can observe that the ISAR images focus well. The coordinate in cross-range is Doppler frequency rather than the target location, because we assume the rotational rate is unknown, which matches most of InISAR real applications. Based on the experimental parameters, we can calculate that the unambiguous size of the target is 26.6 cm. Thus, there exists phase wrapping in cross-range direction, and it is necessary to be solved before cross-range interferometric processing. To achieve image scaling in cross-range direction, the image scaling method described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot2-sensors-19-02330">Section 4.2</xref> is adapt. Four dominant scatterers stronger than 6 dB indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f010">Figure 10</xref> are extracted, and the cross-range Doppler frequencies, interferometric phases, and unwrapped cross-range coordinates of these dominant scatterers are given in 
 <xref rid="sensors-19-02330-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Using Equation (23), we can estimate that the rotation rate is 89.9째/s, which is nearly the same as the real rotation rate 90째/s of the turntable. The estimated rotation rate has verified the effectiveness of the InISAR image scaling method proposed in this paper. The final InISAR imaging results with small rotation angle are shown as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f011">Figure 11</xref>. The algorithm reconstruction time of this InISAR imaging experiment with 4째 rotation angle is 0.784 s. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f011">Figure 11</xref>, The SA InISAR images lose part of target information due to the anisotropic scattering. Besides, the interferometric coordinates of the weak scatterers in the ISAR images exist large errors.
