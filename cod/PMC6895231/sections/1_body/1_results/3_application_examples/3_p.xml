 </sup>, however so far no quantitative information on the orientation of single particles has been provided. Here, we performed a content uniformity Raman measurement on a tablet containing carbamazepine dihydrate (CBZD) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Using MCR, these components were decomposed including the fluorescence background as shown in Fig.

 <sub>2h</sub> crystal class) (Fig.
