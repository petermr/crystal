<p>According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the finite element simulation results and mathematical model agreed well with each other. The conductivities of the unit cell increased as the volume fraction of the fibers increased, since the fiber was more conductive than the matrix material. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f005">Figure 5</xref>f, the effective Seebeck coefficient had negative values at a low fiber volume fraction, but became positive as the fiber volume fraction increased. This was because the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> phase had a negative Seebeck coefficient and Copper had a positive Seebeck coefficient. The effective Seebeck coefficient was dominated by the matrix phase at low fiber volume fractions, and by the fibrous phase at high fiber volume fractions.
