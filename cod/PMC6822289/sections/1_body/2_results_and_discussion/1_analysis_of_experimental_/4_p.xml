<p>Analyzing the collected 2D COFs we noted that in only a few cases (21) two layers are reported in the unit cell, and it is often not clear the method that was used for the generation of that particular stacking configuration over all possible ones. For the remaining 253 structures only one layer was reported, assuming AA stacking. Therefore, by consistently considering two layers in the conventional unit cell for these 2D COFs, we allow the geometry optimization to explore both the “serrated” configuration (i.e., where odd layers are slightly shifted) and the “inclined” configurations (i.e., where there is a constant offset of the layers, resulting in tilted unit cells). Note that the serrated configuration cannot be obtained when only one layer is considered.</p>
