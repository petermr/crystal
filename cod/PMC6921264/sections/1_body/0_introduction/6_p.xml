<p>While the prediction of the lattice structures of EMs remains challenging, the new FF is helpful for studying the behaviors of neat LLM-105 under high pressures, which is crucial for the prediction of its detonation performance. In this work, we developed a tailored FF for LLM-105 based on first-principles calculations. After parameterization has been carried out step by step, the validity of the FF has been evaluated by the MD simulations. The FF possesses good performance to describe the LLM-105 molecular and crystal structures and present structural response on pressure. Our work provides not only a tailored FF for LLM-105, but also a powerful tool to explore the response mechanisms of LLM-105 at the atomic scale, which is helpful to improve the understanding about the balance between energy and safety in EMs.</p>
