 </sup> DZVP-MOLOPT-SR contracted Gaussian basis sets, and an auxiliary plane wave basis set. The plane waves cutoff is set to 600 Ry cutoff, and these are mapped on a 4-level multigrid, with relative cutoff of 50 Ry and progression factor of 3. The orbital transformation (OT) method was used, and if a band gap &lt;0.1 eV was found, the calculation was rerun from scratch using Broyden diagonalization and Thomas–Fermi smearing at 300 K.
