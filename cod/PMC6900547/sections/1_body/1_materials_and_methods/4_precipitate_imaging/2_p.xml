<p>Precipitates from different experiments were attached to carbon stickers and coated with 6 nm of platinum before being examined using a FEI Helios Nanolab G3 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a focused ion beam. Chemical analysis of the precipitates was conducted during the SEM analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Lithium cannot be analyzed using conventional EDX detectors; therefore, the presence of C and O, but absence of a cation, was used to identify the Li-carbonate phase. Crystal aspect analysis was conducted based on the system described by Um et al.

 </sup> for ice crystals, which show a morphology similar to the crystals formed in the synthesis experiments. Analysis of crystal morphology aspect parameters: total length, total width, height from central face to top of crystal, width of central face, and width of side faces, was conducted in Adobe Photoshop. Crystals used in the aspect analysis were chosen that were lying with the longest crystal axis parallel to the electron beam to limit measurement errors due to image perspective effects. In addition, only crystals where the entire length of the crystal could be seen were chosen. These requirements limited the number of crystals that were measurable, and thus aspect ratios for 10 crystals from each experiment without and with the highest concentration of additional ions were obtained.
