<p id="Par54">In order to provide efficient simultaneous off-axis and on-axis Raman scattering signal registration we designed and constructed custom Raman microscope objective (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Zoomed area in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12A</xref> illustrates the difference between collecting cones of light scattered in the Silicon sample at on-axis and off-axis geometries. Immersion-type objective allows performing off-axis measurements at 45° with regard to the surface normal. However, due to high reflective index of Si, real collected scattering angle from depth of the sample was around 15°. We confirmed resulting internal angle by the fit of off-axis experimental data on Si wafer with plane (111) (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4E</xref>).
