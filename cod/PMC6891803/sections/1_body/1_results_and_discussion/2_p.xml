<p>LMO is a high voltage cathode material
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
 </sup> exhibiting a spinel structure with a lattice parameter of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 8.245 Å, while LLTO is a high ionic conducting electrolyte
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
 </sup> with a perovskite structure (
 <italic>a</italic> = 3.904 Å), making them an interesting combination, similar to previous successful spinel–perovskite VAN formations.

 </sup> The successful phase separation of both materials into a nanopillar matrix structure within the nanocomposite can be observed in the SEM images, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>a,b, while the purity and crystallinity of both specific phases are confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD),

 </xref>c. The out-of-plane (100) crystal orientations of both LMO and LLTO phases within the VAN films are aligned with the orientation of the STO substrate. The LMO and LLTO peaks show the presence of highly crystalline oriented spinel and perovskite structures, in good agreement with previous studies of individual LMO or LLTO thin films grown on STO(100) substrates.

 </sup> The small extra peaks suggest the presence of minor contributions of tetragonal LLTO (Li
 <sub>0.56</sub>La
 <sub>0.33</sub>TiO
 <sub>3</sub>), which could be randomly distributed throughout the LLTO matrix or located at specific interfaces. This minority tetragonal LLTO phase will be studied in detail in follow-up research. Also, the in-plane orientations of both cubic LMO and LLTO phases are aligned to the cubic substrate as confirmed by detailed XRD analysis (not shown), resulting in square LMO nanopillars rotated 45° with respect to the (010) in-plane direction of both the perovskite LLTO matrix and STO substrate. Furthermore, phase separation was also confirmed by energy selective backscattered SEM analysis, where contrast is determined by compositional differences (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>d), leading to a much brighter LLTO matrix because of the presence of the heavy La ions.
