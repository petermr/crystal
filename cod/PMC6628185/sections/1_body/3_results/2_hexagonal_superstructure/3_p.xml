<p>Single NWs were transferred on a Si(100) substrate and polarization-dependent spatially resolved measurements were performed at room temperature and at 5.5 K. We performed measurements using two different excitation wavelengths; here, we present results obtained with λ

 </xref>d. This mode is forbidden by selection rules in the adopted scattering geometry and is indeed absent in the theoretical results. The forbidden LO mode arises in both bulk and NW samples from the use of a high NA objective (see

The SO mode is also revealed in the spectrum collected from the WZ NW but absent in the spectrum collected from the bulk (011) GaP, confirming its origin. Both of these features (the finite size effects and the high NA of the objective) are not accounted for in the theoretical modeling and thus this disagreement is not surprising. Finally, notice that the TO mode in the experimental spectra of the ZB, WZ, and TSL is broadened to the low-frequency side. This effect, well-known in bulk GaP,
