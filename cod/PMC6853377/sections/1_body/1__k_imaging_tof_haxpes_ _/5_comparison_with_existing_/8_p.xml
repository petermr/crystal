<p>An alternative way of accessing large solid-angle intervals has been implemented in the 
 <italic>display-type analyzers</italic> by using a combination of grids. As early as 1980, Eastman 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed the first instrument of this kind with a filter stage consisting of an ellipsoidal electron mirror as low-pass and spherical grid as high-pass (Eastman 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>). Later, Daimon 
 <italic>et al.</italic> and other groups published several improved design studies (Daimon, 1988
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> ▸</xref>; Daimon 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> ▸</xref>; Matsuda 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb43"> ▸</xref>), in particular a display-type spherical-mirror analyzer that can obtain atomic stereoscopic images (Daimon, 2001
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb11"> ▸</xref>). Imaging almost the full half space simultaneously at a given energy, these instruments achieved a wealth of good results (Guo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> ▸</xref>; Daimon 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> ▸</xref>; Kato 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb44"> ▸</xref>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb46"> ▸</xref>). The micro-lens action of the grid meshes sets a principal limit to the achievable energy and angle resolution (Matsuda 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb43"> ▸</xref>); this restriction can be reduced with ultrafine-mesh grids. These instruments are window-type spectrometers, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> they acquire 2D images and the spectral information is retrieved by scanning the grid potentials.
