 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f002">Figure 2</xref> reveals the melting characteristics of four kinds of polyethylene. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f002">Figure 2</xref> that the melting temperature of LDPE is the lowest and the melting peak is small; the melting temperature of LLDPE is higher than that of LDPE, and the melting peak is lower than that of LDPE; the melting temperature of MDPE is higher than that of LLDPE, and the melting peak is higher than that of LLDPE; andthe highest melting temperature and melting peak of HDPE are very similar to those of MDPE, and the melting peak area is slightly larger than that of MDPE.

 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The crystallinity for four kinds of polyethylene was calculated by DSC test software. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> that the crystallinity from four kinds of polyethylene is different: the crystallinity of LDPE is the lowest; the crystallinity of HDPE is the highest; the crystallinity of MDPE is higher than that of LLDPE; and the crystallinity of LLDPE is slightly higher than of LDPE, although both are similar. It can also be seen that LLDPE and LDPE not only have similar density, but also have similar crystallinity. Meanwhile, it is known from experiments that the crystallinity increases with the density.
