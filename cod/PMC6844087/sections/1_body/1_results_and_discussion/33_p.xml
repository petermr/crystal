 </xref> provides an overall comparison of our results with those previously reported by other authors. The sample prepared at 850 Â°C has been used for the comparison because its conditions are similar to those in other studies and it may be considered to represent the optimal conditions found in the second DoE. Only studies with the same crystal structure have been considered for a more rigorous comparison.
