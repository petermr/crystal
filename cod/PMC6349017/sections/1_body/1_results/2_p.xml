<p>Similar to the perspective of “proton hole” diffusion for exploring the Grotthuss mechanism of OH
 <sup>–</sup> diffusion in water, we here adopt the convention of exploring “proton hole diffusion” at the ZnO–water interface. To this end, we define “proton hole centers” (PHCs) to be typical proton acceptors, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> “free” (unprotonated) surface oxide ions, O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup>, as well as the combination of adsorbed hydroxide ions (O*H
 <sup>–</sup>) and the corresponding surface Zn ion. We use the term proton hole in this context simply as an indicator for a “missing” proton; our use of this term does not imply that the proton hole diffusion mechanism on the surface, which will be explored below, is equivalent to the archetypal proton hole diffusion mechanism for OH
 <sup>–</sup> in water (for a full account of the differences between 
 <italic>proton</italic> and 
 <italic>proton hole</italic> diffusion mechanisms in water, see 
 <xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">ref. 1</xref>). In our analysis, we could in principle have explored proton diffusion instead, but this would have led to rather complicated definitions of “proton centers” (see ESI
