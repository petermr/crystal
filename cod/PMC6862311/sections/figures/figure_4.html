 <caption> Scheme of an X-ray diffraction experiment in transmission geometry. The focused X-ray beam can probe different spatial positions on the sample. Diffraction pattern recorded by a 2D detector positioned behind the sample and polar coordinate system for evaluation of the angular cross-correlation function C ( q 1 , q 2 , Î” ) are shown. The intensity of the diffraction pattern is coded by color. </caption>
