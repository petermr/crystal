<p>Alongside the high kinetic energy, the key feature of the new ToF momentum microscope is the increased diameter of the 
 <italic>k</italic>-space images. This is achieved by a strongly enlarged electron optics (lens diameters 100 mm instead of previously 20–40 mm) and a DLD with 80 mm diameter (previously 40 mm). The result is a strongly enhanced 
 <italic>k</italic>-field-of-view up to ∼25 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> diameter, revealing many BZs in parallel. A particular challenge was the development of an objective lens that keeps the image aberrations small despite very large phase-space volumes. In addition, this lens allows imaging in the conventional acceleration mode (extractor at high positive voltage), at zero extractor field and in the space-charge suppression mode using a strong decelerating field in front of the sample surface. This aspect of space-charge correction and suppression is discussed by Schönhense
