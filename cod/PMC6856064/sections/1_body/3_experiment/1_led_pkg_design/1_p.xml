<p id="Par23">In this study, eight middle size chips of each LED chip manufacturer were selected and compared with each other. The test LEDs were fabricated in this study using various LEDs developed by multiple companies. Considering the luminous efficacy and CRI points, we have used 2140 LED chips in this study. In order to realize high CRI and improve the light efficiency of the PKG, six power terminals (two for each LED) were used to control the currents of the bonded chips individually. Also, the PKG includes an integral heatsink for absorbing heat generated from the chip and dispersing the heat into a heat radiator and a terminal for applying an external power source. The PKG designed in this study is characterized by the structure of a single encapsulation for phosphor that can bond blue and UV chips simultaneously and phosphors that can absorb the excitation light of two wavelengths (UV and blue).</p>
