<p>The electrode endurance was studied in open circuit conditions and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01957-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows the symmetric cell impedance under OCV at 0 h compared with a constant current density of 200 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> after 20 h and 40 h at 850 °C and 800 °C. It is possible to observe that under the electrical flow of direct current, the 
 <italic>dc</italic> current flux produces an alteration in the electrode polarization resistance, increasing the electrolyte resistance and the polarization resistance, probably indicating an incipient reaction in the interface.
