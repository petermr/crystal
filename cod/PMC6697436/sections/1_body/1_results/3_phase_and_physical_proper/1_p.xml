<p>To understand the excellent OER activity in Shandite Co

 <sub>2</sub>, the phase and physical properties of the bulk single crystal are investigated in detail. 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and fig. S7 show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a typical crystal for physical and electrocatalysis measurements. Bulk single crystals with dimensions of up to several centimeters can be grown and can easily be exfoliated into lamella. The sharp and clear ordered diffraction spots from the Laue diffraction pattern confirmed the high quality of the single crystal (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This high quality and the purity were further confirmed by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (figs. S8 and S9). A possible structural transition is excluded by performing single-crystal XRD measurements down to 100 K using a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer. As revealed by the refinement parameters (table S1), the R-3
 <italic>m</italic> space group is maintained throughout the measured temperature range, with only a slight thermal expansion. As shown in fig. S10 (data S1 and S2), the crystal structure at 100 K is characteristic to the Shandite family; the Co atoms, which are octahedrally coordinated by four Sn and two S atoms, form a Kagome net perpendicular to the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis. However, the cobalt-centered octahedra are compressed, with significantly shorter Co-S distances (2.17 Å) than the Co-Sn (2.67 Å) distances (table S3). For high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations, a thin lamella was fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) micromachining. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and fig. S11, the well-defined lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.27 nm could be readily indexed to the (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The temperature (
 <italic>T</italic>) dependence of resistivity measurements was measured in four-probe configuration from 2 to 300 K along 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> axes, respectively. The low anisotropy of the electrical resistivity indicated that the Co 
 <italic>d</italic> electrons are itinerant. The room-temperature resistivity along the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis [exposing the (001) surface] was only 337 μohm cm, which is much lower than that for nanostructured electrocatalysts deposited on an electrode or conductive substrates (

 <sup>−3</sup> by Hall measurement. The combination of high conductivity and high carrier concentration in the single crystal could improve the electrocatalytic activity remarkably (

 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>C</sub>) was determined to be 175 K from zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) measurements of magnetization (fig. S12). Susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss law, and an effective moment of 0.31 μ
 <sub>B</sub>/Co was observed (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This is consistent with the results of band structure calculations and the fact that the band dispersion near

 <italic>d</italic> orbitals and having a polarized magnetic moment of about 0.33 μ
