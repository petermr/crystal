 <caption> Vibrational spectra for ε, β, γ and ζ polymorphs of CL-20 crystals. The characteristic peaks of the vibrational spectra are marked by vertical red lines and are indexed by blue texts. For each of the four polymorphs, the molecular conformation and the temperature ( T initiation ) the crystal starts to decay under shock are also shown. </caption>
