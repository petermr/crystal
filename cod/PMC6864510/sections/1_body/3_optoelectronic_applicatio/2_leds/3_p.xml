<p>In order to achieve higher efficiency in LEDs, maximized radiative recombination is desired, while nonradiative recombination should be suppressed, which requires the regulation of basic material properties, such as defect state density, carrier mobility, and exciton binding energy. Quasi‚Äê2D perovskites have large exciton binding energy, so electrons and holes can stay in a limited region for a period longer than decay time, providing a greater possibility for the radiative recombination (the radiative recombination rate depends on the overlapping ratio of wave functions of electrons and holes).
