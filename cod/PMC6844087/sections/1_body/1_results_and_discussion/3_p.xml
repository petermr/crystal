<p>By analyzing these results, it is possible to corroborate that the desired CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> phase is predominant in all of the experiments. It has a tetragonal structure with cell parameters of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> = 5.8444 Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 8.6340 Å. Moreover, smaller quantities of rhombohedral Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and monoclinic CuO are also detected. The presence of these structures is in good agreement with the obtained results under similar conditions by other authors.

 </sup> The characteristic CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> peak at around 18° is present in all of the samples, but it seems clear that the peak at 24°, which corresponds to Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, disappears as the thermal treatment becomes more intense (larger times and higher temperatures). Therefore, it is seen that higher temperatures and longer times favor the ferrite formation, as could be expected. Considering that the relative peak intensity is directly proportional to the presence of each phase, and that all of the samples have been consecutively measured in the same device and under the same conditions, it is possible to make a first approximation to determine their relative purity.
