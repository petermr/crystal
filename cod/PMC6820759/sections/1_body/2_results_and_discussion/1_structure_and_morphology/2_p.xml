 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(B)</xref>. As shown, the doped phosphors’ curves are slightly different from the CLSO host, with same absorption peaks at 924 cm

 </sup>, [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] tetrahedron vibration absorption peaks located on 1100–900 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 600–400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively correspond to the asymmetric Si-O bond stretching modes and the [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] silica tetrahedron bending modes. In this host, the asymmetric stretching of Si-O bond produces an absorption peak of which wavenumber is 924 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and a multiple absorption peak at 538–400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> should be assigned to silica tetrahedron bending. Figure
