<p id="Par7">During the limited time of the synchrotron radiation X-ray analysis, the 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell was heated by a ceramics heater to approximately 55 °C to improve the ionic conductivity of the dry polymer and LLZ, which realized a high CV sweeping rate of the cell. Terminals A and B were used to supply the current for the heating. The 
 <italic>operando</italic> cell was set on the cell holder in a glove box and transferred to 3DnanoESCA without air exposure.
