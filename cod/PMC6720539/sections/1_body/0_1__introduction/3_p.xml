<p>At present, molecular simulation technology has been successfully used to study the hydration characteristics of montmorillonite. Marry and Mignon studied the behavioral characteristics of different cations (Li
 <sup>+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup>, and K
 <sup>+</sup>) in the hydration process of montmorillonite by methods of MC and MD simulation, and found that as the water content between the smectite layers increased, Li
 <sup>+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> were easily separated from the montmorillonite interlayer, while K
 <sup>+</sup> moved to the surface of the siloxane tetrahedron and was bound to the surface [

 <sub>2</sub> concentrations in Na-MMT, which has its layersâ€™ charge concentrated in its octahedral sheet, weak ion-surface interactions result in fully hydrated ions and, therefore, more extensive swelling than in I-MMT [

 <sup>+</sup>, Li
 <sup>+</sup>) has higher expansion and hydrophilicity [

 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On the contrary, montmorillonite with weaker hydration cations (K
 <sup>+</sup>, Cs
 <sup>+</sup>) has lower swelling ability, poorer hydrophilicity, and its hydrophilicity is also affected by various factors (such as temperature, pressure, etc.) [

However, montmorillonite formed in different geological processes usually has different crystal chemical properties and layer charge characteristics, which will inevitably affect the hydration properties of montmorillonite, and therefore affect the physical and chemical performance of its derivatives [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As can be seen from the above, the previous studies in this field mainly focused on the influence of the interlayer cation types, temperature, and pressure conditions on hydration properties of montmorillonite [

 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are few studies about the effect of layer charge density on the hydration properties of montmorillonite.
