 <sub>2</sub>CaSiO
 <sub>4−δ</sub>N
 <sub>2/3δ</sub> (LCSON), Li
 <sub>2</sub>SrSiO
 <sub>4−δ</sub>N
 <sub>2/3δ</sub> (LSSON), and Li
 <sub>2</sub>BaSiO
 <sub>4−δ</sub>N
 <sub>2/3δ</sub> (LBSON), secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis was used. It is well known that SIMS gives the best detection limit for identifying elements with very low concentrations compared to other techniques in surface analysis area. The elemental composition using SIMS can be quantitatively determined with an ion-implanted standard material.

 </xref> shows the atomic intensity and concentration versus the sputter depth of the compounds. For Li, Si, and O atoms among the three phosphors, no difference in the secondary-ion intensities was observed, while the intensities of secondary-ion for Ca, Sr, and Ba atoms changed because of the different sensitivities of the elements. The concentrations of N atom are analyzed as a function of sputter depth from the surface to the inner region of the grains (∼5000 nm) for the three samples. The contents of N
 <sup>3–</sup> ion were calculated as shown in

 </xref>d. The average contents of N
 <sup>3–</sup> ion for LCSON, LSSON, and LBSON were 0.003, 0.009, and 0.032, respectively. It is remarkable that the N
 <sup>3–</sup>-ion content increases with larger alkaline-earth metal-ion size (Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> &gt; Sr
 <sup>2+</sup> &gt; Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>), probably implying that Li

 <sub>4−δ</sub>N
 <sub>2/3δ</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors with the larger ion size can easily accommodate more N
 <sup>3–</sup> ions in the crystal sites. The framework of the Li
 <sub>2</sub>MSiO
 <sub>4</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) structure is connected by SiO
 <sub>4</sub> and LiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra with M
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, where two SiO
 <sub>4</sub> and LiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra are linked through sharing of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the bond lengths of MO
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> polyhedra may be affected by the N
 <sup>3–</sup> content introduced into the host lattice. The average bond distances for the three compounds (see
