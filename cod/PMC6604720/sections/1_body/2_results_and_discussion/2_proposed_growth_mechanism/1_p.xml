<p>The growth mechanism of the resulting Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> crystals was investigated by considering both the SEM and TEM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The growth mechanism that governs almost the entire nucleation and crystal growth process here was reported already by Hussain et al. [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] in detail, where the authors employed hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) during the fabrication of La(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> crystals. HMTA degrades into ammonia that acts as hydroxide source. In this study, HMTA was replaced with LiOH, and Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> crystals were obtained through the interaction of OH
 <sup>−</sup> ions released from LiOH with Y
 <sup>3+</sup> ions from the yttrium source in water at room temperature. Even at 5 min, Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> crystals were formed as in a needle-like shape. Such a fast crystal formation may indicate fast nucleation, and here (which is similar to the idea proposed by Hussain et al. [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] where the authors argued that the excessive NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> ions may accelerate the reaction between La
 <sup>3+</sup> and OH
 <sup>−</sup>), excessive Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions in the reaction media may be responsible for this rapid growth. Extending the reaction time to 15 min, the crystals grow into larger structures and rod-like structures appear in the form of nanorod bundles, probably due to crystal splitting. For 60 min of reaction time, rod-like structures transform into rice-like shapes that are in contact mainly with each other as a part of a self-assembly process occurring as a result of a saturated splitting process [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, multipod-like (or flower-like) morphology was also observed for some particular crystals, which are probably the result of this self-assembly process where there is more time to act on these particular crystals. The crystal growth mechanism is summarized and illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>. Compared to HMTA, which decomposes into ammonia and releases OH
 <sup>−</sup> ions slowly, LiOH is able to give OH
 <sup>−</sup> ions through complete dissociation directly to the reaction medium. Since the rate of hydroxide release is a strong parameter to control the size, size distribution and defect content of the resulting crystal, it is expected to obtain a variation for these values in the case of comparing the effect of HMTA and LiOH on the crystal growth. Moreover, such a difference between HMTA and LiOH in terms of the rate of OH
 <sup>−</sup> release may allow the formation of these crystals even at room temperature (as reported in this study), while the authors that used HMTA kept the reaction mixture at 75 °C. On the other hand, crystal growth splitting, as observed for various material systems such as SrTiO

 <sup>3+</sup> and La
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] in the literature, is associated with fast crystal growth. A possible cause could be the oversaturation of reactant species. When the concentration of reactive species appears to be higher than the threshold (which may vary for each material depending on its chemistry), fast crystal growth takes place. This fast growth may force a high density of crystal defects, i.e., the atoms do not have enough time for placement in the crystal array and the metal atom misplacement may occur during the fast growth. These defects gradually develop nuclei sites developing branches, leading eventually to splitting.
