<p>The simulation of IR spectra of crystalline melamine was based on harmonic analysis that was executed in three-dimensional periodic representation of crystal structure in Crystal 09 software (Aethia Srl, Italy) [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. An infinite 3D model of crystal lattice of melamine was constructed by defining the primitive cell, in accordance with the experimental structural data obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. An unconstrained and full geometry optimization was performed, in which both the atomic centers and cell parameters underwent the treatment prior to all subsequent calculations. The following procedural parameters were set throughout the geometry and vibrational computing steps. The Monkhorst–Pack reciprocal space was sampled over a shrinking factor that was equal to eight. The self-consistent field (SCF) direct procedure was iteratively converged with a tolerance of 10
 <sup>−13</sup> atomic units per unit cell; the truncation of Coulomb and exchange sums in direct space was controlled by setting the Gaussian overlap tolerance criteria to 10
 <sup>−8</sup>, 10
 <sup>−8</sup>, 10
 <sup>−8</sup>, 10
 <sup>−8</sup>, and 10
 <sup>−16</sup>. With the objective of accelerating the convergence of the SCF procedure, a linear mixing of Fock matrices by 25% between adjacent steps and an energy shifting of 0.8 hartree for the first SCF cycle were employed. The electron integrals were numerically calculated over a dense (XL) integration grid. The periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations were performed with the use of B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr) [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] single-hybrid density functional, as implemented in Crystal 09 software.
