 </sup> According to our results, a much higher migration barrier (1.20 eV) should be overcome for migration to the Co–O layers, and it seems that the discrepancy comes from the missing quantum mechanical description of a strong Co–O chemical bonding and dealing with high temperature up to 1573 K in ref (
