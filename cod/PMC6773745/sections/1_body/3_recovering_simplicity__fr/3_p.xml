<p id="Par11">There is a particular beauty in the finding that complex structures can emerge from simple interactions. Many examples are known, but Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e–h</xref> illustrates the specific case of skyrmion magnets. Here, a handful of ingredients—ferromagnetism, lattice chirality and antisymmetric exchange—give rise to a hierarchical ‘skyrmion crystal’ phase at specific combinations of temperatures and magnetic field

 </sup>. So this ostensibly complex magnetic structure can be captured much more simply in terms of very few microscopic interactions. The system complexity is reduced fundamentally by shifting from atomic positions to atomic interactions. An obvious question is whether the hierarchical structure of PMN shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref> might also emerge from relatively simple interactions. Indeed an interaction-based model for PMN was developed in ref.

 </sup>, and the immediate community will no doubt wish to compare the results of that study with the recent RMC work. In particular, if it can be shown that both arrive at essentially equivalent real-space descriptions, then the structural complexity evident in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref> arises entirely from a combination of simple cation-ordering rules and the interactions between neighbouring Pb–O, Mg–O, Nb–O and O–O atom pairs. Having reduced the system to these few parameters, one might more straightforwardly assess how to vary these parameters to control the relaxor state.
