 <p>Skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric magnets are vortex-like spin arrangements, viewed as potential candidates for information storage devices. The crystal structure and noncollinear magnetic structure together with magnetic and spinâ€“orbit interactions define the symmetry of the skyrmion structure. We outline the importance of these parameters in the Heusler compound Mn
  <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn which hosts antiskyrmions, a vortex-like spin texture related to skyrmions. We overcome the challenge of growing large micro-twin-free single crystals of Mn
  <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn, which has proved to be the bottleneck for realizing bulk skyrmionic/antiskyrmionic states in a compound. The use of 5d-transition metal, platinum, together with manganese as constituents in the Heusler compound such as Mn
  <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn is a precondition for the noncollinear magnetic structure. Because of the tetragonal inverse Heusler structure, Mn
  <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn exhibits large magneto-crystalline anisotropy and

  </sub> symmetry, which are necessary for antiskyrmions. The superstructure in Mn
  <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn is induced by Mn-vacancies, which enable a ferromagnetic exchange interaction to occur. Mn
  <sub>1.4</sub>PtSn, the first known tetragonal Heusler superstructure compound, opens up a new research direction for properties related to the superstructure in a family containing thousands of compounds.
