 </sup> that yielded a fingerprint of the local environment of each atom. In the crystalline solid, 55% of atoms had a bcc entourage and about 7% were fcc or hcp. The remaining atoms had no crystal symmetries in their local surroundings due to boundary atoms between the K matrix and the Na cluster. In contrast, in the amorphous solid none of the atoms had a bcc crystal entourage, only 10 atoms had fcc-, and 2 had ico- surroundings. Altogether, an insignificant number of atoms in the amorphous solid was characterized by a local surrounding with definite crystal signature.
