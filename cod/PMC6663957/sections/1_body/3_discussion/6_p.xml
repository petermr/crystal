<p id="Par62">As for the spatial resolution, the simulation results show that the new model improves the images compared to the standard cylindrical model. The line profiles across the point sources show that in the transaxial plane, the spatial source distribution is much sharper for the block model, while in the axial direction, the two models give similar results. The reason is that the difference between the two models in the axial direction is only a gap between the two detector blocks while in the transaxial plane, the difference is more significant because all detector elements are slightly dispositioned for the cylindrical model.</p>
