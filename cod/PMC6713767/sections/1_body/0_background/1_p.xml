<p id="Par13">Luminescent materials are widely used in many fields, such as lighting and display devices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Over the years, rare-earth (RE) europium (Eu)-activated luminescent materials have received more attention due to their unique optical properties, such as high brightness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], high chemical stability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and excellent eco-friendliness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In particular, Eu ions have two oxidation states of divalent (Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>) and trivalent (Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>), exhibiting different emitting characteristics. Generally, Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are mainly as a red-emitting activator which originated from 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> → 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>J</sub> (
 <italic>J</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) transitions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, their 5d electrons located in the outer orbitals, are susceptible to their surroundings. Thus, their emissions are easily affected by the crystal field environment, having a wide region from ultraviolet (UV) to red. Chen et al. prepared Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated fluorophosphates Ba
 <sub>3</sub>GdNa(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>F with blue and red double-color-emitting phosphor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Sato et al. reported red-emitting Ca
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>4</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Lin et al. synthesized Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca
 <sub>9</sub>Mg(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub>F
 <sub>2</sub> phosphors with blue to yellow color emission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is suggested that Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated phosphors caused by parity-allowed 5d–4f electronic transitions show strong broad emission band [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated phosphors are the main focus of luminescent materials in the recent years.
