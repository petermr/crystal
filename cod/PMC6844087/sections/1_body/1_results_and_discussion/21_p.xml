<p>All of the analyzed samples have the same predominant crystalline CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> phase found in the first batch, with smaller traces of CuO and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. It is worth noticing that the characteristic peaks of these undesired phases have been considerably reduced and are difficult to be detected with this view. Again, to make a better comparison between the different synthesis conditions, some peaks are zoomed and shown in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>. The selected peaks are the same as those in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure
