<p>where 
 <italic>I</italic> is the emission intensity, 
 <italic>X</italic> refers to the activator concentration, and 
 <italic>K</italic> and β are constants under the same excitation condition for the given host crystal. θ is a constant of multipolar interaction, and θ = 6, 8, 10 denotes electric d–d, d–q, q–q interactions, respectively. The relation between log(
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>x</italic>) and log(
 <italic>x</italic>) is linear and the slop is −0.70, indicating that the nonraditive energy transfer mechanism among the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions in the host is the d–d interaction. These results further demonstrated that the performance of GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors was closely related to the mesoscale behavior and the uniform doping of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> in GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> microparticles.
