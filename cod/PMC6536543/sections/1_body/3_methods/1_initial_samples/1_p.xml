<p id="Par21">Naturally occurring tilleyite crystals from the Crestmore quarry in the Jurupa mountains (Riverside County, California, USA) were kindly provided by the Yale Peabody Museum (Specimen YPM MIN 041104). A few crystals were optically selected under the microscope and crushed with a mortar and pestle, giving a fine white powder without lustre. Qualitative chemical analyses were done on a Philips XL30 scanning electron microscope by the method of energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Only traces (&lt;1â€‰wt%) of Al and K were found apart the Ca, Si, C and O atoms present in the ideal Ca
