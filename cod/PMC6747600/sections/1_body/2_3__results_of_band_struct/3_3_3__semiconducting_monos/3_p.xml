<p>Density functional theory in GGA approximation commonly underestimates the band gap of semiconductors due to many-body effects. Usually, this underestimation can be corrected by using hybrid functionals, better describing nonlocal exchange effects in electron–electron interactions. For FeSi, a B3LYP hybrid functional and Hartree–Fock calculations were performed in Ref. [
