<p>In addition to uniform alignment, the photoalignment approach offers the possibility to align the light emitting QRs on patterned surfaces.[qv: 35c] The azo dye‐based alignment layer has the ability to reorient the alignment direction upon subsequent irradiation by polarized light with a different polarization azimuth. This allows us to realize multi‐domains alignment of QRs: by adding an amplitude mask for the second irradiation, a micro‐scale alignment pattern for the QRs can be achieved with a distinguishable easy axis of alignment. Using this technique, domain sizes as small as 2 µm could be realized for the binary alignment domains, as shown in
