 </xref>). Briefly, chloroauric acid was first mixed with tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr) and excess thiol (PhCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SH) in methanol to form Au(I)-SR polymers. Then, Au(I)-SR was reduced by sodium borohydride (aqueous solution) to form nanoparticles. After a size-focusing process lasting for ~4.5 hours, the precipitated product was washed with methanol and isolated using PTLC. The Au

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Ph)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> product was confirmed by ESI-MS (see fig. S1). Triangular prism-like single crystals were grown by vapor diffusion of acetonitrile into a toluene solution of the purified nanoparticles over 1 week at room temperature (fig. S2). As a close comparison, block-like crystals of PET-protected Au

 <sub class="sub">60</sub> were also grown in the same manner but were unfortunately unresolvable (fig. S3), similar to earlier reports by others (
