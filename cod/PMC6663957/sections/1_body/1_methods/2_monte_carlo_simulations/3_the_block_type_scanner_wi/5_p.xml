<p id="Par32">A Derenzo phantom with sphere diameters of 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.8 mm made of water was used in order to evaluate the effect of spatial resolution on the image quality. The initial activity of 100 MBq of 
 <sup>18</sup>F was distributed uniformly inside the spheres, with the same activity per volume in the spheres. The acquisition time was 5 s. The spheres were located inside a water cylinder with 25 mm length and 30 mm diameter. Therefore, the effect of positron range was present in the simulation.
