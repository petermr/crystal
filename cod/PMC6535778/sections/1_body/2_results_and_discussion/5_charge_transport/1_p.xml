<p>The transport of electrical charge in materials where interactions between different states may be present is of interest. The temperature-dependent resistivity for a single crystal of EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, measured in the (001) plane, is thus shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>A. Decreasing resistivity with decreasing temperature, i.e., metallic behavior, is observed. The charge transport is sensitive to the magnetic state of the system: ρ
 <sub>
  <italic>xx</italic>
 </sub> (the resistivity in the 
 <italic>x</italic> direction with the electric field applied along the 
 <italic>x</italic> direction; 
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> directions are in the plane of the layers, while 
 <italic>z</italic> is perpendicular to the layers) shows a drop below the Neel temperature (∼30 K). The in-plane resistivity ρ
 <sub>
  <italic>xx</italic>
 </sub> increases slightly at temperatures above the magnetic ordering temperature, starting near 58 K. Also, as seen in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>B, a linear relation between the Hall resistivity ρ
 <sub>
  <italic>yx</italic>
 </sub> (field is applied along 
 <italic>z</italic>, electric field along 
 <italic>x</italic>, and resistivity measured along 
 <italic>y</italic>) and applied magnetic field 
 <italic>H</italic> is seen at various temperatures. From this data we are able to calculate the concentration of the dominant carriers (
 <italic>n</italic>), which are holes, by using 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1/(
 <italic>eR</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>) (where 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> is the Hall coefficient, obtained from the slopes of 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>B, and 
 <italic>e</italic> is the electron charge).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
 </sup> We find that, at 2 K, 
 <italic>n</italic> is about 2.9 × 10
 <sup>20</sup> cm
 <sup>–3</sup>, a relatively large hole concentration. The slope of the ρ
 <sub>
  <italic>yx</italic>
 </sub> (
 <italic>H</italic>) curve decreases somewhat with increasing temperature, and thus the carrier concentration is increasing with increasing temperature.
