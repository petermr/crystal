<p>The high-pressure hydrate structure formed by methane—and also krypton, argon, and nitrogen—at pressures of a few GPa was first observed by Loveday

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The water to methane ratio in MH-III is close to 2, although the precise stoichiometry is likely linked to the filling ratio of the precursor clathrate phase. Below

 </inline-formula>3 GPa, the dynamics of the enclathrated methane are not very different from those of the isolated molecule at low pressures. As pressure increases in MH-III, the O–C distances shorten and methane vibrations become more and more entangled with those of the neighboring water molecules. Above
