<p>At the beginning, conventional methods of DSC and thermal expansion tests were used to detect the phase transformation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn. DSC result in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows a wide and weak endothermic peak at about 330 K during heating process, and the corresponding exothermic peak during cooling process was too weak to be clearly observed. The thermal expansion measurement result in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f001">Figure 1</xref>b shows an obvious turning at about 330 K, which means the thermal expansion coefficient of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn changes at this temperature. It is quite possible that the solid state phase transformation of intermetallic Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn indeed exhibits at room temperature (~330 K from thermal expansion test result) as suggested by DMA results in [
