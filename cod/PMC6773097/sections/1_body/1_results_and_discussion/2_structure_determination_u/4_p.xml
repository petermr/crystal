<p>Recently, we showed that physically meaningful anisotropic ADPs can be obtained from ED data, provided these are of sufficiently high quality.
 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> ADPs are known to act as a “fudge factor” for poor quality data. For this reason, they are often refined isotropically or their physical meaning is ignored. In the case of SSZ‐27, the anisotropic refinement of the ADPs was stable without the addition of restraints and their values are physically sensible (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> b,c). They are slightly elongated along the 
 <italic>z</italic>‐direction, which we attribute to lower data redundancy along this direction. The ADPs of the O atoms are slightly larger than those for Si, and elongated in the direction perpendicular to the plane formed by the Si‐O‐Si bonds. The fact that reliable ADPs can be obtained for submicron‐sized crystals from ED data may open up new possibilities for studying the atomic vibrations or static disorder in zeolites that do not grow large enough for X‐ray single‐crystal analysis. Finally, we attempted to find the position of the SDA from the ED data. To do so, the SWAT instruction was removed, and a difference map generated. Although the difference map clearly revealed two large clouds of residual electrostatic potential (Supporting Information Figure S3), refinement of the SDA in the heart‐shaped cavity was not stable, so we had to conclude that the data do not support refinement of the SDA at this stage (see also the Supporting information).
