<p>Possible scenarios for Eu doping in a Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> crystal is also investigated by state-of-the-art first principles calculations. Total energy minimization calculations suggest that while substitutional doping of Eu atoms by Y, O or H is energetically unfavorable, interstitial doping at the holey site surrounded by the H atoms is a preferable adsorption site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). It was observed that the interstitial doping of Eu atoms slightly enlarges (0.5%) the bonds between neighboring atoms belonging to the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> crystal. Regarding the stability or robustness of Eu dopants in the host material, molecular dynamics calculations show that Eu atoms, covalently attached to the host lattice with a binding energy of 2.34 eV, maintain their atomic position in the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> crystal for more than 5 ps at room temperature.
