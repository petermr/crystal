 <p id="Par2">The irreversible layered-to-spinel phase transformation is detrimental for many cathode materials. Here, the authors show that reversibility can be realized in crystal water containing sodium birnessite by controlled dehydration, leading to enhanced ion diffusion kinetics and improved structural stability.</p>
