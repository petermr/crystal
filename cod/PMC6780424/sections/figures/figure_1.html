 <caption> Dynamics simulation method of shock wave tests. ( a) Schematics of the simulation method. ( b) Validation of the code by comparing the Hugoniot curve of a single crystal model of octogen (HMX) single crystal to the reported experimental and calculational results in the literature. ( c) Accuracy verification of the code by comparing the lattice lengths of the studied eleven energetic single crystals to the experimental values obtained by X-ray crystallography. </caption>
