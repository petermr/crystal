<p>As shown in §
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3a">3.1</xref> and also demonstrated in both experiment and theory, cubic structure Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi Heusler compounds are ferromagnets with considerably large magnetic moments. Magnetic variation under tetragonal distortion is also of high interest and great importance because it is directly related with the magnetic shape memory effect and the development of spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory. The calculated total and atom-resolved magnetic moments for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in both tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> and tetragonal XA structures under different 
 <italic>c/a</italic> ratios are shown in figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F10">10</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F11">11</xref>, respectively. We can see that the variation of the total magnetic moment is still mainly from the Fe atoms, the same as in the cubic structure. Consequently, we focus our discussion on the magnetic moment of Fe atoms. For the tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> structure in both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi, the two atoms in sites A and C always have the same moment values and thus overlap throughout the whole 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> variation because of the same surrounding environment even in tetragonal structure. In order to detail the moment variation of Fe atom, we need to go back to the crystal structure. As an example for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> structure, the two Fe atoms in sites A and C have the same surrounding atoms of four Si atoms and four Ni atoms forming two tetrahedrons, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F1">figure 1</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>. By varying the 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio, the distance between Fe atom and its nearest Si atom is calculated and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F10">figure 10</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>. It is found that this distance value is increased when the 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio is changed from 1 on both sides. As discussed in §
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">3.2</xref>, this distance plays an important role for the magnetic moment of Fe atom and its increase would lead to the moment gain of Fe atom, as found in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F1">figure 1</xref>
 <italic>a</italic>. For Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in tetragonal XA structure, the two Fe atoms have different environments so that we need to calculate the nearest Fe–Si distance for each of them, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F10">figure 10</xref>
 <italic>d</italic>. The magnetic moment variation of the two atoms can be still related with the Fe–Si distance change in the same way. For Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in both tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> and tetragonal XA structures, the partial moment variation of Fe atom can still be understood with the Fe–Si distance in the same way.
