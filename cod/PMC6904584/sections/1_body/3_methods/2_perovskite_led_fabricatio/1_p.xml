<p id="Par16">The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol by sonication. The cleaned substrates were treated in UV ozone for 15 min. The, PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) aqueous solution was spin-coated at 3500 round per minute (RPM) for 40 s and baked at 125 °C for 30 min in ambient air. After that, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox and perovskite solution was spin-coated on top of substrate at 4000 RPM for 40 s. Five hundred microliters of chloroform was poured onto perovskite film 20 s after the spin coating started. The perovskite films were annealed at 90 °C for 20 min. Finally, the fabrication of PeLEDs was completed by thermally evaporating TPBI (40 nm), LiF (&lt;1 nm), and Al (100 nm) electrode. The device area was 0.10 cm
 <sup>2</sup> as defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrode.
