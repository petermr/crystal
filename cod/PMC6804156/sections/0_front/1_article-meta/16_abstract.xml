 <p>There are several key requirements that a very good LED phosphor should meet, i.e., strong absorption, high quantum efficiency, high colour purity, and high luminescence quenching temperature. The reported Rb
  <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
  <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
  <sub>4</sub>):Eu
  <sup>3+</sup> phosphors have all these properties. The Rb
  <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
  <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
  <sub>4</sub>):Eu
  <sup>3+</sup> phosphors emit bright red light if excited with near-UV radiation. The calculated colour coordinates show good stability in the 77â€“500 K temperature range. Moreover, sample doped with 50% Eu
  <sup>3+</sup> possesses quantum efficiency close to unity. Besides the powder samples, ceramic disks of Rb
  <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
  <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
  <sub>4</sub>) specimen were also prepared, and the red light sources from these disks in combination with near-UV emitting LED were fabricated. The obtained results indicated that ceramic disks efficiently absorb the emission of 375 and 400 nm LED and could be applied as a red component in phosphor-converted white LEDs.
