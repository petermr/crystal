<p id="Par6">These observations from past studies make it clear that despite being small, the defects induced by helium-implantation at room temperature can significantly alter the physical and mechanical properties of tungsten. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear. To prevent these undesirable helium-implantation induced changes, it is essential to understand how the induced defects interact with the surrounding microstructure and evolve. This is also vital for enabling accurate predictions of the evolution of structural and functional properties and the lifetime of irradiated tungsten armour components; a critical aspect for the successful design and operation of commercially viable fusion reactors.</p>
