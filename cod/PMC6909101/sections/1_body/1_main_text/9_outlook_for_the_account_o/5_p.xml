<p id="p0695">Thus, in the general case (that is, taking local vibrations into account) in our picture, just as in the Franck-Condon picture, MQT occur in two stages. However, while in the Franck-Condon picture the rapid quantum jump (in the electron energy) precedes the slow process of nuclear reorganization, in our picture, on the contrary, the quantum jump (in the vibrational energy of the nuclei) occurs when the reorganization of the nuclei, as a result of the electronic transition, has already been completed. The construction of an adequate mathematical technique for the accurate description of such a physical picture is a separate and rather complex problem, the solution of which will require the collective efforts of the scientific community in the future. Until this solution is obtained, one can continue to use successfully the standard and essentially erroneous Franck-Condon explanation given in the existing literature (see Refs. [
