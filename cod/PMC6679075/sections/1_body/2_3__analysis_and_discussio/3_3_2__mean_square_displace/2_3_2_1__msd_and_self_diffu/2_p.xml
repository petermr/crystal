<p>Compared with the influence of the charge position, the charge density of the montmorillonite had a more significant effect on the diffusibility of the water molecules in the interlayers, and the diffusibility of the water molecules decreased with the increase in the layer charge density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). The reason was that as the charge density of montmorillonite increased, the polar attraction of siloxane to water molecules increased; water molecules moved toward the siloxane surface, and the number of hydrogen bonds formed by the combination of O in the siloxane surface (O
 <sub>t</sub>) and H in the water molecule (H
 <sub>w</sub>) increased. This is consistent with Greathouseâ€™s conclusion that water molecular diffusivity is related to hydrogen bond fracture among layers of montmorillonite [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the action of hydrogen bonding, water molecules are bound to the surface of the montmorillonite tetrahedron and difficult to diffuse. This phenomenon was more pronounced when the ratio of tetrahedral isomorphism was higher in montmorillonite.
