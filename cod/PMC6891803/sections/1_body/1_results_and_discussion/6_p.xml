 </xref> shows the KMC simulations for the VAN surface after 300 pulses of nanocomposite growth at a 20 Hz deposition rate in the temperature range 700–900 °C. The KMCS results are in good agreement with the variation in VAN formation in the experiments as shown by the AFM images in

 </xref>. The LMO and LLTO components phase-separate into well-defined and evenly spaced nanostructures. The KMCS model does not incorporate anisotropic interaction energies to reflect different crystal facets and disregards the thermodynamic processes for energy minimization at the interfaces between the different material phases, that is, the nanopillars and matrix. The two components show some intermixing because the interaction energies are relatively close, while increasing the difference between these values will lead to stronger phase separation.
