<p id="Par12">In this 
 <italic>operando</italic> measurement, we confirmed no drastic change of electronic structure of Co and the importance of strong hybridization of the Co 3
 <italic>d</italic> and O 2
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals. Precise discussion should be provided in the future development of the 
 <italic>operando</italic> measurement system using all solid-state LIBs with oxygen free solid state electrolytes like sulphide.
