<p id="Par10">Analysis of the PDF derived from X-ray scattering data reveals that local structural distortions due to electronic fluctuations emerge at the Curie transition of magnetite. This confirms that fluctuations in Fe–Fe bonding are the dominant electronic instability that couples charge and orbital fluctuations to the magnetic order and hence are the origin of the Verwey transition. Although many experimental studies of magnetite have been carried out at temperatures around

 <sub>V</sub>, changes near 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> are much less investigated and will be important to explore the incipient electronic fluctuations further. Such ‘hidden’ local instabilities may also be important to the physics of other spin-polarised conductors and orbitally degenerate materials, and the assumed uniformity of their high temperature structures may require critical reassessment.
