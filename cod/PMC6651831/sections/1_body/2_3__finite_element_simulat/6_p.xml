 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f006">Figure 6</xref> provides temperature distributions on the yâ€“z plane for both cylindrical fiber model and square fiber model at 30% fiber volume fraction. Enlarged views of the top surface are shown in the insets. For both composites in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f006">Figure 6</xref>, a temperature gradient caused by the transverse Peltier effect can be clearly observed in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction, the temperature was uniformly distributed except at the ends of the electrodes. In the insets of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the abrupt temperature change at the interfaces of the fiber and matrix phases was the result of the Peltier effect.
