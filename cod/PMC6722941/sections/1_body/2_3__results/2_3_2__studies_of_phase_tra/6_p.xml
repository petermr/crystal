<p>In accordance with the presented data, a rise in the lattice parameters is attributable to an alteration in the concentration of elements in the structure, the processes of introduction and substitution of atoms in the lattice sites under thermal annealing, as well as the formation of new phases and a drop in regions of disorder (results of 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). A rise in the temperature of annealing contributes to the migration and subsequent removal of oxygen from the structure of nanoparticles. That results in ordering of the crystal lattice with the following formation of the magnetic phase of hematite in the structure. At an annealing temperature of 800 °C, the content of amorphous inclusions in the structure does not transcend 13%, which demonstrates a high degree of orderliness of nanoparticles. A decrease in dislocations density, which gives rise to a decrease in dislocation defects and distortions in the structure, also indicates a drop in amorphous inclusions and an ordering of the crystal structure.
