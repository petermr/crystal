<p>The QB 220-A4-503YB type has shown a better performance of output power and sound level value. The large size of the piezoelectric transducer is able to convert a higher mechanical energy from sound wave into electrical energy. An energy harvester of piezoelectric transducer accomplished constant stage with the maximum amplitude at sound level of 96dB. It accomplished maximum power response performance at the 96 dB with 33.133 dB (Î¼W) as shown in
