 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-materials-12-01804">Section 4</xref>, it has been mentioned that the two approaches adopted in this paper to extract displacement information were the analysis of the elementary crystalline cell and a field approach. This section is devoted to the development of the second approach.
