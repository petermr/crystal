<p id="Par30">From the above results, it is also clear that the long-range Coulombic interaction between the jogs, while aiding in their formation, barely counters the attractive elastic force between the jog pairs. This is reflected in the conclusion from the elasticity analysis that, for both MgO and UO
 <sub>2</sub>, the dependence of the total energy change on the jog pair separation width during the vacancy dissociation is fairly weak. In the case of MgO, this is validated by the atomistic modeling result as well.
