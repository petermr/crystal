<p>As is evident from the represented data, the decrease in amorphous inclusions in the structure result in a rise in the number of cycles of endurance tests at which the specific discharge capacity does not decrease below 80%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-f009">Figure 9</xref>b presents a graph of the lifetime with the storage capacity exceeding 80% for the initial and modified nanostructures when cycling in the charge capacity mode of 1000 mA h/g. An increase in the lifetime for samples annealed at 600 °C and 800 °C is due to the formation of a hematite phase in the structure, which leads to a rise in crystallinity and a drop in amorphous inclusions in the structure, which have a negative effect on the degradation rate of the electrode material. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01079-f009">Figure 9</xref>c shows the SEM images of the studied nanoparticles after life tests. The decrease in battery life associated with a decrease in capacity below 80% of the initial value is due to the degradation of structural properties due to an increase in the content of amorphous-like inclusions and partial degradation of nanoparticles as a result of lithiation processes. Since the main processes of lithiation occur through reactions involving the exchange of oxygen, which leads to a change not only in the oxygen concentration, but also in partial degradation of the structure as a result of breaking chemical and crystalline bonds in the lattice.
