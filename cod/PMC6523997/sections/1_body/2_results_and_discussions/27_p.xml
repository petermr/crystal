 </sup> Zinc(II) has a smaller ionic radius compared to Pb(II) and, as it is incorporated in the crystal lattice, fits in V
 <sub>Pb</sub> or interstitial sites to passivate defects. It might also be possible that the decreases in the bulk defect density is a consequence of the increase of the formation energy of defects. Furthermore, the reduction of grain boundaries due to grain enlargement induced by 3-CPACl reduce the amount of dangling bonds, which are usually present in those regions, improving the overall quality of the film.
