 </sup> The PHREEQC speciation simulations predict that 27% of the carbonate present in the system studied here is incorporated into Na-carbonate ion pairs in the LiBr-Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solutions at 20 °C. At the same temperature, the number of ion pairs between Na and carbonate increases to 76% and 32% in the 1 and 0.1 M NaCl solutions, respectively. Elevating the solution temperature to 80 °C is expected to make the ion pair formation less thermodynamically favorable with only 9% of carbonate occupying these ion pairs in the LiBr-Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and NaCl solutions at this temperature. No ion pairs were predicted in the presence of K
 <sup>+</sup>, as there is no thermodynamic data available for these species. This is consistent with the absence of experimental evidence for the formation of K-carbonate contact ion pairs and our solution concentration, which was lower than that required to form solvent mediated ion pairs.

 </sup> Only Li–chloride and Li-sulfate ion pairs can be modeled using the llnl database. When 1 M of Cl is present, 1.5% of Li in solution is predicted to form an ion pair with Cl
 <sup>–</sup>. These ion pairs are expected to increase to 2.5% of the total Li
 <sup>+</sup> in the experiments at 80 °C. In contrast, 12% of Li
 <sup>+</sup> is predicted to form Li-sulfate ion pairs with the highest concentration of sulfate in solution. As for the carbonate ion pairs with Na
 <sup>+</sup>, the Li-sulfate ion pairs are expected to be less favorable at higher temperatures, with 10% of the Li
 <sup>+</sup> occupying these complexes at 80 °C.
