<p>Similarly to MOFs, we see a rapid increase in the number of novel COFs that are being reported. Often these materials are synthesized with a particular application in mind, and experimental data are often limited to this application; it is simply not practical to experimentally test a novel material for all possible applications. For such studies a computational screening to identify the most promising candidates is often the most efficient first step. Essential in these computational studies is that all experimental structures are curated in, what is referred to in the literature as, “Computation-Ready Experimental” (CoRE) structures,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
 </sup> The importance of this curation step cannot be emphasized enough, and as we will argue in this work, in particular for COFs, the lack of a systematic approach makes it impossible to reliably compare structures for different applications.
