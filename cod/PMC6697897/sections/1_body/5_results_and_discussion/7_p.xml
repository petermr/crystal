<p>We point out that there is no signature of free methane in the measured spectra and that both the methane stretching and the IV modes are remarkably stable and recognizable with increasing pressure. These facts show that the MH-IV phase remains stable at least up to the maximum investigated pressure of 150 GPa, i.e., well beyond all previous observations in gas hydrates. Our simulations and theoretical analysis indicate that the repulsive interactions between host and guest molecules still dominate after the transition and that, up to 150 GPa, there is no evidence of hydrogen bond formation between methane and water molecules.</p>
