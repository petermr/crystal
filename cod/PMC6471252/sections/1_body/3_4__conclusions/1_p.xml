 </inline-formula>. We performed X-ray structural analysis at several pressures in the range of 0.001–2.6 GPa, as well as UV-Vis fluorescence analysis and theoretical calculations. The material turned out to be an indirect semiconductor, with the crystal structure stabilized predominantly by dispersive interactions between molecules organized in infinite

 </inline-formula>-stacking can be related to the unique spectroscopic properties of the material, namely its increased fluorescence efficiency and red shift of the fluorescence in the solid state. In particular, it appears to facilitate the formation of the efficiently red-emitting multi-component excimers of
