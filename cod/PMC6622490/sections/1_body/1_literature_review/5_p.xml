<p>Egypt has a big source of wasted energy in the form of noise pollution as an unwanted sound. This wasted energy could be converted to a beneficial source of energy through using the suitable approach with the appropriate technology. As mentioned earlier in this research that according to the third law of thermodynamics, mechanical energy can be converted to electrical energy, thus sound as a form of mechanical energy can be converted to electric energy. There are three approaches to convert sound to electric energy; by heating, by using the diaphragm and through using piezoelectric materials. [
