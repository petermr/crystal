<p>Owing to the increased inelastic mean-free path, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) in the X-ray range is rapidly gaining importance for electronic structure analysis of solids. Pioneering work (Claesson

Today, instruments for soft X-ray ARPES exist at several synchrotron radiation sources and have reached very high performance. Excellent results are being published with an increasing pace (

In the hard X-ray range the situation is different because rapidly dropping subshell cross sections and increasing background due to phonon scattering make hard X-ray ARPES (HARPES) a difficult task.
