<p>The role of Fourier transform (FT) in recovering displacement information from gray levels recorded by a 2D sensor is discussed in detail in References [

 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The FT provides the components of projected displacement vectors corresponding to Cartesian coordinates x and y. This process requires the introduction of two orthogonal carriers in the case of Cartesian coordinates [

 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that provide two projected displacements vectors that added give the final displacement vector. Due to the hexagonal structure of the crystal, the carriers are aligned in three different directions. It is necessary to point out that in 2D the tensors associated with the displacement field can be obtained if information on displacement in three different directions is provided.
