 <caption>
  <p>Secondary structure of representatives of the three classes of riboswitches within the purine family. Sequences are based upon those used for determination of the crystal structure of (
   <bold>A</bold>) the 
   <italic>B. subtilis xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch aptamer domain (PDB ID: 4FE5), (
   <bold>B</bold>) the 
   <italic>M. florum</italic> I-A class-I 2′-dG riboswitch aptamer domain (PDB ID: 3SKI), and (
   <bold>C</bold>) the 
   <italic>env1</italic> class-II 2′-dG riboswitch (this study). The secondary structural elements which are common to all three classes, are labeled as P (paired), J (joining) and L (loop). Nucleotides highlighted in red directly interact with the ligand nucleobase and nucleotides in blue within the 
   <italic>env1</italic> sequence represent key differences in the ligand binding three-way junction between the 
   <italic>xpt</italic> and 
   <italic>env1</italic> RNAs. The dashed lines represent two sets of base-base interactions in the junction that distinguish the three classes of riboswitches.
