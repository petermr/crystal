<p id="Par7">The activation of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> is further evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which shows a reduction in charge transfer resistance (R
 <sub>CT</sub>) by half after 100 cycles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Moreover, the reaction kinetics displayed a significant change upon potential cycling of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub>, with Tafel analysis after 100 cycles suggesting a possible change in the rate-determining step (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). TMDC electrocatalysts have been proposed to operate via the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism of hydrogen evolution, with the electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky) known to be slow, e.g., rate-limiting (Table
