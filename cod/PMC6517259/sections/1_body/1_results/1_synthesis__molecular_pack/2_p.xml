<p id="p0045">High-performance organic HTLs are always amorphous to ensure a complete coverage of the underlying perovskite in PSCs. The thin films are usually grown rapidly via spin-coating to prevent the formation of crystallites. However, the alignment of adjacent molecules in these films likely resembles that in the single crystal to some extent (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Baldo et al., 2001</xref>). To elucidate the molecular packing and charge transport characteristics of O5H-OMeDPA in the solid state, we grew its single crystals by slowly evaporating a saturated, racemic solution of dichloromethane/heptane. The as-grown O5H-OMeDPA single crystals present an overall crack-free morphology and distinct borders (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). X-ray crystallographic structure analysis was carried out to define the molecular packing (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). As displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D, a pair of enantiomers 
 <italic>M</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> are observed in the crystal. As 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref> presents, the oxa[5]helicene segment distorts with a torsion angle of 30.89°, which is slightly larger than that of DFT-optimized geometry (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). For the O5H-OMeDPA geometry from single crystal, HOMO is also wholly delocalized over the electronic skeleton (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>B). The enantiomers form an antiparallel face-to-face dimer. The dimers stack on top of each other to form slipped columnar motifs along the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis, via the C-H⋅⋅⋅π interaction of the terminal methoxyphenyl with the oxa[5]helicene core. Within the crystallographic 
 <italic>bc</italic>-plane the dimers arrange in T-shape herringbone pattern, and their cohesion is achieved by London dispersion forces.
