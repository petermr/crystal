<p id="Par12">We investigated the distribution of yttrium in the CsPbBr
 <sub>2.4</sub>Cl
 <sub>0.6</sub> and PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films, to understand its functions in PLQE enhancement. We first examined whether yttrium ions incorporated into the 3D perovskite phase. We grew single crystals of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> with the presence of YCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the solution. The Y distribution in the crystal was studied by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry, which is a sensitive technique to detect trace metal ions as low as particle per quadrillion. The details about crystal growth can be found in the Methods section

 </sup>. The single crystal was sliced into small pieces and the compositions of the crystal at different depth were measured. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the Y/Pb ratio in the crystal center is 0.5%, demonstrating yttrium ions could incorporate into CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite crystals. In addition, it was interesting to find the Y/Pb ratio gradually increase from the crystal center to surface, yielding an yttrium concentration gradient in the crystal. A gradient distribution of Y ions can be explained by the enhanced chemical pressure in the solution during the growth of crystal, because more Y ions excluded into solution during crystal growth increase its concentration in solution. Similar to single crystal growth, the larger amount of Y added in solution for thin film growth should also cause a concentration gradient, as illustrated in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref> revealed the bandgap of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> was increased by Y incorporation. We also found a high density of yttrium on the perovskite film surface using surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The XPS spectra of PEACl:CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> (1:1) films with different ratios of YCl
 <sub>3</sub> are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>. The Y 3

 <sub>3/2</sub> peak at 160.4 eV obviously increases with yttrium incorporation in the films. The Y/Pb ratios on the surfaces of the films derived from XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>. The Y/Pb ratios on the film surfaces are three to seven times higher than the corresponding Y/Pb ratios in the precursor solution, indicating that yttrium ions accumulate on the film surfaces or grain boundaries.
