<p id="Par38">The crystal structure of coesite-V was determined only at one pressure point at 56.7(9) GPa, where no admixture of coesite-IV was present. At higher pressures, the amount of the reflection peaks was not enough to refine the crystal structure properly, since the crystals tend to amorphize and few high-angle diffraction peaks could be observed.</p>
