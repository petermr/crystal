<p>In the current work, we synthesized a series of polycrystalline Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>:
 <italic>x</italic>% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0–100) phosphors by means of a facile hydrothermal reaction. A broad 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) → 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> emission band spanning 640–850 nm can be efficiently generated under excitation of UV/blue/orange light. Moreover, emission peak of 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) → 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> was obtained with a continuous red-shifting from 710 to 745 nm as Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration increases to 
 <italic>x</italic> ∼ 100. It is of great interest that the intensity of 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub>(4F) → 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2</sub> monotonically increase until higher Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration 
 <italic>x</italic> ∼ 60 with a maximum QY of 75 ± 5%. Energy transfer dynamics of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions and the capabilities of photobiological application were systematically analyzed by means of time-resolved spectra and by an encapsulated blue light InGaN LED device, respectively.
