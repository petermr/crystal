<p>Sn (II) attracted much attention due to its similarity of the electronic structure with lead atom. Thus, the tin-based perovskites are potentially applicable in the field of optoelectronic devices. In the work [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a simple and efficient solution-phase method to synthesize Cs
 <sub>2</sub>SnX
 <sub>6</sub> (X = Br, I) with a good yield, well-defined crystal structure, and long-term stability was demonstrated (

 <sub>2</sub>SnX
 <sub>6</sub> single crystals show excellent stability against light and moisture due to the unique vacancy-ordered defect-variant structure, stable Sn

 <sub>x</sub> millimeter-size single crystal, with the reaction mixture color continuously changing from transparent to yellow and, finally, to dark red. In addition, the band gap can be changed by the halide composition of single crystals, which leads to continuous tuning of the absorption spectra from near violet to orange spectral region. Also, for these structures, strong surface charge recombination of the excess carriers near the crystal surfaces created by short-wavelength light was observed.
