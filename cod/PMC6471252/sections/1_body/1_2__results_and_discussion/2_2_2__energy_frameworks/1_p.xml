 </inline-formula>-stack, as well as in inter-stack interactions. There is no interatomic interaction present, in which the electrostatic term would play a dominant role (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01107-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The total intermolecular interaction energy of the stacked molecules is ca. −62 kJ/mol, comparable with strong H-bonding. Notably, the values of lattice and intermolecular interaction energies at ambient pressure conform well to the CrystalExplorer estimates. It is also clear that the interactions between the stacks are at least twice weaker than inter-stack ones. The next strongest interaction in the crystal lattice, involving the weak C–H⋯O bonds, results in intermolecular interactions no stronger than −28 kJ/mol. The energy framework viewed along the [100] direction is a typical [
