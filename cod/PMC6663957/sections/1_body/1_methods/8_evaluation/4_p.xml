<p id="Par46">The cylindrical and block models were also evaluated in terms of time and memory consumption. For this purpose, the computations were performed on a single core of a local computer (Intel® Core™ i7-4710MQ CPU at 2.50 GHz × 8). Single forward and backward projections as well as iterative OSEM reconstruction were implemented on a data set from the 
 <italic>Scanner B</italic> with different sizes of the system matrix. In order to create different sizes for the system matrix, maximum ring difference of the 3D sinogram was changed from 0 to 15 by steps of 5. The number of subsets and subiterations for the OSEM algorithm were six and 12, respectively. The OSEM reconstruction was run without using the MPI option and with caching the system matrix enabled. Currently, the standard cylindrical model utilized symmetries existing in the system matrix in axial and transaxial directions. The number of symmetries in the block geometry is smaller than the cylindrical geometry. Only axial symmetries have been implemented for the block model in the new version.
