<p id="Par13">Analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) confirmed the composition of SALON. The STEM micrograph (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) shows two phosphor particles, both with diameters of a few hundred nanometres (100 nm at their thinnest, 500 nm at their thickest point), embedded in a SrO-matrix. This matrix is the result of the sample preparation process which was carried out on a larger SALON particle and not inherent to the sample. EDX element maps, obtained by plotting the lateral distribution of the EDX signal intensity of the respective X-ray lines within the spectrum, indicate that the crystals are rich in nitrogen, aluminium, and strontium, and also contain oxygen (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The surrounding matrix is rich in strontium and oxygen. A quantification of the EDX spectra acquired from the phosphor particles resulted in an element ratio of Sr:Al:O:N approximately equal to 1:1.8:2.1:1.7. Within the accuracy of the measurement, this result is very close to Sr:Al:O:N equals 1:2:2:2, thus in agreement with the X-ray diffraction data.
