<p id="Par12">Real photocathodes are also subject to the possibility of oxygen contamination due to residual gases of K and Cs dispensers. A detailed region spectrum of the Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic> and O 1
 <italic>s</italic> regions for P007 is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The oxygen contamination of a sample can be calculated from this plot by extracting the relative peak intensity of the O 1
 <italic>s</italic> and Sb 3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>5/2</sub> states. Since the binding energies shown in the plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> (bottom panel) are so close, the spectrum has been deconvoluted to identify the individual contributions of the O 1
 <italic>s</italic> and the two Sb species (3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>5/2</sub>) with oxidation state Sb
 <sup>3−</sup> (blue and orange dashed lines) and Sb
 <sup>(0)</sup> (red and purple dashed lines). For reference, the raw measured data is reported with offset (black solid line) together with the Shirley background (black dashed line), which has been subtracted to obtain the deconvoluted spectrum in the foreground. From this graph it is clear that the P007 sample is dominated by antimony atoms with Sb
 <sup>3−</sup> oxidation state. Very minor contributions from Sb
 <sup>(0)</sup> can be seen only for the 3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>5/2</sub> electron at 527.6 eV. For P007 we also see some oxygen contamination identified by the broad peak centred at 532.6 eV, which is visible also in the stoichiometric analysis reported below (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The analysis of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> is exemplary to the characterization of a photocathode sample which highlights the chemical nature of the grown material, which contain oxygen impurities and non-stoichoimetric composition, as discussed below with reference to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.
