 <caption> ( a) The structure of η-Al 41Sm 5 showing two Sm-centered motifs: ( b) the 1-6-6-6-1 motif marked in blue, and ( c) the 1-5-6-5-1 motif in grey. Pink (blue/grey) represents Al (Sm) atoms. ( d) The formation energy of known stable and meta-stable phases at 0 K as a function of the Al composition. The solid line connects the thermodynamically stable phases (black squares) shown in the phase diagram. The red circles are the meta-stable phases. </caption>
