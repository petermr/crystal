<p>The base concentration 
 <italic>q</italic>(
 <italic>A</italic>) of the hydroflux turned out to be the most important factor for the synthesis of the oxohydroxoferrates. With KOH, four phases were found in different concentration ranges: 
 <italic>α</italic>‐Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, K
 <sub>2−x</sub>[Fe
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>7−x</sub>(OH)
 <sub>x</sub>],
 <xref rid="open201900287-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic>, and KFeO
 <sub>2</sub> (Figure 
 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 
 <italic>q</italic>(K)≤0.5 results in phase pure 
 <italic>α</italic>‐Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> in the form of dark‐red hexagonal crystals (Figure S1, Supporting Information). With increasing base concentrations, red hexagonal plates of K
 <sub>2−x</sub>[Fe
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>7−x</sub>(OH)
 <sub>x</sub>] form in addition and their relative amount grows until phase‐pure K
 <sub>2−x</sub>[Fe
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>7−x</sub>(OH)
 <sub>x</sub>] is obtained at 
 <italic>q</italic>(K)=0.7 (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). At 
 <italic>q</italic>(K)=0.9, few crystals of 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> appear besides K
 <sub>2−x</sub>[Fe
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>7−x</sub>(OH)
 <sub>x</sub>], at 
 <italic>q</italic>(K)=1.1, phase‐pure synthesis of 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> is achieved (Figure S4 and S5, Supporting Information). Above this concentration, KFeO
 <sub>2</sub>, the anhydride of 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic>, starts to form as ochre green distorted octahedra, and exceeding 
 <italic>q</italic>(K)=1.4, this is the only product (Figure S6 and S7, Supporting Information). No other product was found up to the highest tested 
 <italic>q</italic>(K) of 1.8. To conclude, with increasing KOH concentration, the K to Fe ratio in the products increases until the hygroscopic nature of the hydroflux leads to the formation of an anhydride with 
 <italic>n</italic>(K) : 
 <italic>n</italic>(Fe)=1. Extreme base concentrations have no significant influence on the hydroflux reactions, but affect the melting point of the hydroflux, making the syntheses impractical. Up to now, the only other concentration dependent product formation in hydroflux reactions was reported for copper, where compounds with copper in different oxidations states were obtained.
