 <caption> Experimentally measured cross-correlation function (CCF) C ( q , Δ ) at four different values of the momentum transfer q 1 = 0.027 nm −1, q 2 = 0.029 nm −1, q 3 = 0.031 nm −1, q 4 = 0.044 nm −1 (top) and modelled CCFs assuming ideal face-centered cubic (fcc) (middle) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) (bottom) structures. Curves are shifted vertically for better visual appearance. (adopted from [ 85]). Used under CC-BY 4.0. </caption>
