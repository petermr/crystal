<p>However, to improve agreement with the experiment, one has to consider real scattering mechanisms beyond CRTA. This effect can be considered, using CoSi or GeSi semimetals as an example. In these materials, the electronic spectrum near the Fermi level is quite complicated and contains both electron- and hole-like bands, and also branches with parabolic-like and nearly linear dispersion.</p>
