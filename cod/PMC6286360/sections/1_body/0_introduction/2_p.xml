<p id="Par4">Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is a novel photophysical phenomenon in which the luminogens are non-emissive in dilute solution but become highly emissive in aggregate state

 </sup>, and so on. The construction of AIEgen-based 3D COFs, which will precisely integrate AIEgens into 3D porous crystalline organic framework, should be very interesting

 </sup>. First, the rigid skeleton can restrict the intramolecular rotation, vibration, and motions of AIEgens. Consequently, the obtained 3D COFs may be fluorescent, which can provide a unique platform for us to understand the underlying mechanism of AIE. Second, as solid-state fluorescent porous materials, these 3D COFs may find interesting applications in different areas, for example, sensing and optoelectronic devices. However, due to the synthetic challenge, AIEgen-based 3D COFs have not been reported yet.
