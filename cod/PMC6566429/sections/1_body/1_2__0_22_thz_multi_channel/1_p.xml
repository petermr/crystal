<p>The radar system is based on linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulse principle and has a synthetic bandwidth of 5 GHz. The transmitter is a chirped signal from 217.1 GHz to 222.1 GHz, thereby realizing a 3 cm theoretical range resolution. The echo signals are received by four receiving channels simultaneously. The schematic diagram of the radar system is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The 0.22 THz multi-channel radar system consists of five modules: the signal generator, radio frequency (RF) front-end, intermediate frequency (IF) processing module, data acquisition module, and cone-shaped horn antennas.
