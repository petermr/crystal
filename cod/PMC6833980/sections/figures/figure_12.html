 <caption> Dispersion surfaces and diffraction geometry in the vacuum. The glancing angle α is taken to be the same as the Bragg angle , for simplicity. T′ 0 and T′′ 0 represent the dispersion surface for the beam with and that with , respectively. represents the dispersion surface for the beam . LaO, L′aO and AO represent the vectors , and , where is the component vector of parallel to the lattice plane. </caption>
