  <p>Representative X-ray diffraction profiles. These were taken from a disk surface of the Al-Mg system after HPT for 100 turns and after natural aging. Comparison with the reference XRD profiles for an as-received Al and the Al after HPT for 5 turns suggests that the Al-Mg system after HPT for 100 turns and after natural aging for 60 days has a pure 
   <italic>fcc</italic> structure with significant peak shifting influenced by grain refinement and compositional straining.
