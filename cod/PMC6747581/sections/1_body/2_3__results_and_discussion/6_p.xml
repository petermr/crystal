<p>All four conditions for the mechanical stability of tetragonal-TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> given in Equations (1)–(4) are satisfied, and this finding indicates that tetragonal-TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> phase is mechanical stable. From the calculated elastic constants, the bulk (B
 <sub>v</sub>, B
 <sub>R</sub>) and shear moduli (G
 <sub>v</sub>, G
 <sub>R</sub>) are calculated from Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximations [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our calculated values of bulk moduli (B) and shear moduli are 22 GPa and 20.143 GPa from the elastic constants, respectively. The critical G/B value that differs the ductile and brittle materials is 0.5 [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-02667" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As known, when the G/B value of materials is lesser than 0.5, then those materials are ductile—otherwise, they are brittle. The value of G/B for TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is 0.916, which shows that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is brittle.
