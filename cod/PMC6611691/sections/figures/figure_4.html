 <caption> Identification of the critical angle. ( A) Blowup of the unit cell of LMO showing the alignment of the critical angle θ CR (purple arrow) with the polar axis of the MoO 6 octahedra. ( B) Rotation of the unit cell’s frame of reference to the polar axis. ( C) A pair of MoO 6 octahedra showing the orientation of the d yz orbitals along this polar axis. A dark exciton, composed of d yz (in green) and d xz (not shown) orbitals, is formed in adjacent octahedra residing in two zigzag chains within a unit cell. Both orbitals have the same quantization axis (again indicated by the purple arrow). Crystallographic drawings were produced using VESTA ( 44 ). </caption>
