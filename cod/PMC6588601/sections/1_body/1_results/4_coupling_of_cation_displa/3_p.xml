<p id="Par23">Atomic configurations obtained from X-ray and neutron-scattering data represent structural snapshots with superposition of both the static and dynamic displacements (see the Methods section for a discussion of the effects of energy integration on both types of data); the latter reflect contributions from acoustic and low-frequency optical phonons. Our observations of the negative correlations between the oxygen and Pb/Nb displacements indicate that the oxygen-shifts involved in such optical modes are sufficiently large to overcome the usually dominant effect of acoustic motion.</p>
