 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f007">Figure 7</xref> is the RDF of Ca-O
 <sub>t</sub> of montmorillonites with different layer charge density. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f007">Figure 7</xref>, we can find that with the increase in the charge density of montmorillonite, due to the fact that the negative charge sites on the Si-O surface increases, under the action of electrostatic attraction, some of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> are pulled towards the Si-O surface; therefore, some new peaks appear around 2.6–4.5 Å, which is more obvious when the layer charge density of the montmorillonite is higher; this further indicates that calcium ions are close to the negative charge sites on the Si-O surface. The simulation results are consistent with
