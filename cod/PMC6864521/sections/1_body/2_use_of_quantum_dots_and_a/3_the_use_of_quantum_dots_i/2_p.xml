 </xref>. With the spectral profile of the three well‐defined emission peaks, QD‐based BLU provides better color saturation and thus a wider color gamut. It has been reported that with an optimized QD‐based BLU, one can achieve a color triangle with greater than 115% of the NTSC standard in 1931 color space (via CIE coordinates).[qv: 2a,5] There are three possible configurations
