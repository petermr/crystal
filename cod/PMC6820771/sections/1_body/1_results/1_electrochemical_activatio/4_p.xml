 <sub>2</sub> undergoes an increase from 68 ± 4 mV decade
 <sup>−1</sup> when inactivated to 116 ± 17 mV decade
 <sup>−1</sup> after activation, thus indicating that the activation process results in the discharge (Volmer) step now being rate-limiting

 </sup>. Upon cycling, there are also substantial changes in the exchange current density (from extrapolation of the Tafel slopes) and turnover frequency, with these parameters peaking at 0.503 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and 0.12 s
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0 mV respectively after 100 cycles (Supplementary Table
