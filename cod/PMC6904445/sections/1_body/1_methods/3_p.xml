<p id="Par21">The IDEs (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> of Supplementary Material) consist of N = 50 gold electrodes, deposited by evaporation using an 
 <italic>Edwards e-beam evaporators Auto 306</italic>, filling the trenches previously made by ion beam etching and after removed by lift-off the resist and the corresponding excess of gold. These electrodes have length L = 7 mm, width W = 20 μm, interspacing G = 20 μm and depth of about 90% of the thickness of the deposited film, in order to avoid a significant dielectric response coming from the substrate. The lithographed IDEs on the prepared GMO films (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> of Supplementary Material) shows a regular pattern of 20.0 ± 0.5 µm wide channels and steps. This technique is fundamental to optimize electric measurements in the film phase across multiple and broader 20 μm region between IDEs, rather than to be limited to gauge the film thickness (&lt;&lt;100 nm) between top and bottom electrodes. Moreover, rare-earth manganites are known to be relatively prone to current losses or even tunneling within such nanometer scale, which would hamper dielectric and polar measurements. As the electrodes are parallel to the substrate edges, which in turn are parallel to the axes of the STO cubic cell, and the GMO film has the in-plane crystallographic axes at 45° relatively to the STO axes, the electric polarization was measured along the [110] direction.
