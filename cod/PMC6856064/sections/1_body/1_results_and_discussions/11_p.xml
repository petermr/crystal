<p id="Par13">Each coordinate in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram represents the CCT value and the coordinates of CIE (x, y), respectively. The CCT and CIE (x, y) coordinates of each PKG are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, an enlarged view is shown. (a), (b) and (c) are the color coordinates and CCT of 1B-Y, 1B-GR, and 1B-BYR LED PKGs and, (d), (e) represents the corresponding coordinates of PKG-1-1UV2B-GR and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LEDs respectively. When compared to 1B-Y LED PKG, all other LEDs exhibit much warmer emission because of the contribution of the red component in the 1B-GR, 1B-BYR, PKG-1-1UV2B-GR, and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LEDs. Moreover, the CIE coordinates of PKG-1-1UV2B-GR and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LEDs lie below the black body locus. Studies suggest that the many observers prefer sources with the CIE coordinates below the blackbody locus

 </sup>. The preference to the sources with the CIE coordinates below the blackbody locus is because of the combined effects of chromaticity and color rendering effects. Studies based on simulations reported that the light sources with chromaticity below the blackbody locus are more likely to have higher scores for relative gamut while maintaining high scores for fidelity.
