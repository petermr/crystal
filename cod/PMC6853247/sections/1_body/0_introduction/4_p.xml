<p>However, in both studies, the stability of Anh‐B phase relative to olivine (or wadsleyite or ringwoodite) + MgO was studied in a system with a very high Mg/Si ratio (=2.8). In the real Earth, (Mg+Fe)/Si is lower (=1‐2) and a more likely reaction is the formation of Anh‐B and stishovite from olivine (or wadsleyite or ringwoodite). However, the details of this reaction remain unclear. Ganguly and Frost (
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) calculated the thermodynamic parameters of Anh‐B and predicted that Anh‐B + stishovite might be present in a cold slab. However, this prediction has not been tested experimentally.
