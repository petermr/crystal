<p>Core-level signals are selected by setting the proper sample bias, such that the binding-energy region of interest is accumulated [

The space charge problem is less serious when recording XPD, because quasi-monoenergetic core-level patterns can be extracted much easier than valence-band patterns, even when Coulomb repulsion in the beam leads to a Lorentzian deformation of the raw data [
