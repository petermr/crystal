<p>Many scholars have undertaken a significant amount of research on the conductance property of polymer nanocomposites. However, most have only studied the modification of low-density polyethylene matrix nanocomposites [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There are very few studies on the conductance property of polyethylene with different densities. In addition, due to the complexity of the structure of polymer materials, there is currently a lack of sufficient understanding of the conductance mechanism of polyethylene. Based on the existing research on polyethylene and polyethylene nano-polyethylene [

 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], this paper studies the effects of different crystallinity on the DC breakdown strength as well as the conductance property of different density polyethylene. It also discusses the effects of crystallinity of polyethylene with different densities on its conductance property based on XRD and DSC.
