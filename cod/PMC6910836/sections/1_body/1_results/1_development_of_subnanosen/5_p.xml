<p>The signal enhancement properties of Au@Ag SHINs with core sizes of 70 and 115 nm (fig. S1, B to G) were also evaluated to confirm the superiority of 100-nm SHINs, as suggested by the 3D-FDTD simulations (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Raman enhancement ratios of eight and nine times were found for 70- and 115-nm Au@Ag SHINs, respectively, while 100-nm particles enhanced the signal by a factor of 33 (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This notable quantitative agreement between simulated and experimental results substantiated the significant enhancement obtained from the current 100-nm Au@Ag SHINs. This phenomenon can be explained by the coupling effect between the absorption wavelength of the surface plasmon resonance from the Au@Ag NPs (fig. S1B) and the wavelength of the incident laser source (532 nm).
