 <caption> Original coordinate system ( X, S) for the inclined X-ray diffraction geometry; 0 Y-axis is perpendicular to the ( X, S)-plane. Φ is the crystal rotation angle around the diffraction vector h parallel to the 0 X-axis. The detector plane is perpendicular to the unit vector s h =  k h|/k along the diffracted wave propagation. </caption>
