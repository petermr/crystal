 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> presents the X-ray diffraction pattern of representative Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> particles having 7.5% dopant ratio (Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>) prepared at various reaction times. The pattern of the starting material (i.e., unreacted yttrium acetate) is given for the comparison. The reflections can be indexed to hexagonal phase (space group of P63/m) Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> with lattice constants of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 6.261 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 6.261 Å, and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.544 Å corresponding to JCPDS: 01-083-2042. The evolution of the crystal is clearly seen in the stack plot of the patterns. When the yttrium acetate is treated with alkaline water for 5 min its reflections begin to disappear. The extension of the synthesis time to 15 min reduces the intensity of the precursor reflections, at the end of 45 min, and characteristic signals of the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> labeled with their corresponding planes become more evident. After 60 min of reaction time, the reflection signals of the resulting product were found to be perfectly matched with the crystallographic data of JCPDS: 01-083-2042. The primitive unit cell of the resulting Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> host crystal is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. This crystal structure indicates two yttrium atoms located at one face of the hexagonal phase and shared oxygen saturated with hydrogens. To investigate the crystal formation of the samples fabricated at 5 min, several low-magnification high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM micrographs were taken and are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. These micrographs reveal that the sample consists of agglomerated nanoparticles. The clusters formed by the sub-10 nm nanoparticles have sizes between 50 nm to a few micrometers. It is possible to visualize the individual nanoparticles in the lower left HAADF STEM micrograph where the building blocks of these agglomerates seem to have sizes smaller than 5 nm. The photoluminescence spectrum of the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors that were synthesized at varying times was registered at 365 nm excitation wavelength (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). At the first 5 min, sharp emission signals appear at 592, 595, 613, 616, 690, 697 and 700 nm, indicating specific D–D and D–F transitions of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> states may be due to crystal splitting by the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> host. As the synthesis time is extended, the intensity of the signals at 592 and 697 nm shows a significant increase while the ones at 613 and 700 nm diminish upon crystallization.
