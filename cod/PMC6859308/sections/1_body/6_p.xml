<p>With these considerations in mind, we undertook a correlative X-ray microscopy study to establish the mode of action of established drugs like chloroquine via its localization within hydrated malaria parasites in their native, albeit rapidly frozen, environment. We provide evidence that both mechanisms take place and argue that the interaction is sufficient to disrupt heme detoxification. We used bromoquine (BrQ), an analog of chloroquine (cf.

 </xref>), to take advantage of the identifiable X-ray fluorescence signal of the bromine substituent, assuming that BrQâ€™s molecular biological properties do not differ significantly from that of chloroquine (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We found that BrQ accumulates at high concentrations in the digestive vacuole, thousandfold exceeding that in the culture medium. Within the digestive vacuole, BrQ caps the hemozoin crystal surface. Such a coverage, defined as the fraction of surface docking sites capped by BrQ and found to range between 4% and 15%, is sufficient to hinder the deposition of oncoming heme molecules. We also observed that BrQ covers hemozoin crystals isolated from the parasites to the same extent as in the digestive vacuole. This suggests a persistent binding of BrQ to the crystal surface. We deduce that BrQ forms a complex with isolated heme, which accumulates at the digestive vacuole membrane, possibly spreading to other parasitic membranes, leading to their disruption.
