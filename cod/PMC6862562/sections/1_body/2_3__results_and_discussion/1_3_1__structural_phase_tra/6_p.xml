 <xref rid="materials-12-03612-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> clearly shows the evolution of the 4c Wyckoff positions at (x, 1/4, z) with the variation of the pressure. The 4c Wyckoff positions x and z of Ge and Se are pressure dependent. The fractional coordinate of Ge(z) monotonically decreases with the increasing pressure, whereas the Se(z) increases robustly. When the pressure reaches 34 GPa, Ge(z) and Se(z) approach the high-symmetry values of 0.0 and 0.5, rendering Ge–Se–I and Ge–Se–III equal in the 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> phase. In addition, the pressure dependence of the fractional coordinates from 0 GPa to 5 GPa is sharper than the others, which is similar to the pressure dependences of the lattice parameters and bond lengths. The evolution of bond length and fractional coordinates outlines a displacive space group transformation from 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> (62) to 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> (63) for GeSe with applied high pressure.
