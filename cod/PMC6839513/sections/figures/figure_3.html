 <caption> (a) PBE-TS and (b) PBE-D2 lattice energy landscapes for phenytoin, classified by H-bonding motif and packing mode (c). Each of the 67 symbols denotes a crystal structure, and each distinct symbol denotes a packing mode. Experimental structures are highlighted with red circles and arrows; structures labeled with structure ID number ( Table S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information) show packing similarity with the experimental structures. The structures encircled with a dashed ellipsoid show high resemblance in packing and H-bonding motif with form I. </caption>
