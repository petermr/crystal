<p id="Par14">When the bond alternation along the 
 <italic>a</italic>-direction is introduced, a band inversion induces a gap between the low-energy and high-energy bands, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>. If the alternation is very small, the structure factor becomes very close to that represented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. Thus, the intensities of the low-energy and high-energy bands greatly vary around a crossing point of 0.74 r.l.u., indicated by arrows in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>; the intensities of the high-energy band significantly increases above the crossing point, while those of the low-energy band become undetectable. Even at different 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic>, the band crossing occurs at the same energy, 
 <italic>J</italic>, since the two dimers are symmetrically equivalent. Consequently, the wavevector-independent gap centered at 
 <italic>J</italic> appears between two triplon bands. Note that the alternation is only allowed along the 
 <italic>a</italic>-axis owing to the symmetry. Therefore, the observed triplon bands can be labeled to be along 
 <italic>H</italic> or 
 <italic>K</italic>, as denoted in Fig.
