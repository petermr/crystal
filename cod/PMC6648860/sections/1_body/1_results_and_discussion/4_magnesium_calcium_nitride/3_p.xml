<p>The Ca–N and Ta–N bond distances (see 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>) are consistent with ionic radii values. The refinement of the occupation factors resulted in a slight Ca deficiency, with Ca/Ta ratio being 0.89(1). The presence of a minor impurity phase with main diffraction peaks at sin(θ)/λ of ca. 0.208 and 0.246 Å
 <sup>–1</sup> was also detected, which may correspond either to CaO or TaN. A Ca/Ta ratio close to 1 was also inferred from EDX with distribution of both elements being homogeneous (see
