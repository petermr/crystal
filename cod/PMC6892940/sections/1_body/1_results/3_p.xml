<p id="Par7">The electrical resistivity (
 <italic>ρ</italic>) of the two end member compounds as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The resistivity data were fitted using an activated transport model as well as using variable range hopping model. Both the data were nonlinear on a 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>−1</sup> scale and was found to be linear on a 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>−1/4</sup> scale (see inset to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a,b)</xref>), in accordance with a three-dimensional variable range hopping transport model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. The insulating nature of the compounds can be explained by the fact that Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>; 3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sup>8</sup> effectively provides electrons of 
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> symmetry at the valence band as the 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> bands are completely filled up, while Re
 <sup>5+</sup>; 5
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> has partially filled 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> bands, thus from the symmetry consideration the electron hopping is prohibited (see the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>). However, a nonzero hopping probability is realized if the bond angles deviate sufficiently from 180°, thereby enabling Ni
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub>-Re 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> hybridization via oxygen (compare the inset to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>). Replacing Sr
 <sup>2+</sup> by the smaller Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ion, we anticipate a larger octahedral distortion that can provide a route for hybridization between the Ni
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> and Re 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub>. Indeed a larger amount of distortion is achieved as understood from the crystal structure of LaCaNiReO
 <sub>6</sub> and consequently a clear decrease in the resistivity is also observed, although the temperature dependence still suggests that the material is best described as an insulator/semiconductor.
