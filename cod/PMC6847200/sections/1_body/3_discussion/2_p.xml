<p>The two 2′-dG binding classes diverge in how they fully establish both high affinity and selectivity for 2′-dG over guanine beyond differences in J2/3. Structural and mutational analysis of the 
 <italic>Mfl</italic>-IA(2′-dG-I) RNA revealed that both local and distal differences in the RNA are required to achieve high affinity, selective binding for 2′-dG over guanine (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These differences include an altered conformation of the 2′-dG-I A33 (A24 equivalent) nucleotide in the three way junction to form a triple at the base of P2 that is not observed in the guanine/adenine and 2′-dG-II classes, as well as an L2-L3 interaction that preserves the G–C Watson–Crick pairs between the loops but differs substantially otherwise. In contrast, the 2′-dG-II class of RNAs appears to exploit only local differences around the ligand binding pocket to achieve high affinity and selective binding of 2′-dG, which is driven in part by a unique two-nucleotide insertion in J3/1. The ability of classes of riboswitches to exploit local changes around the binding pocket to yield differences in ligand binding selectivity has also been observed within the 
 <italic>ykkC</italic> family of riboswitches. This family contains classes that recognize guanidine, PRPP or ppGpp that are distinguished by sequence and structural differences around and within the junctional binding pocket that include a point substitution and an insertion element (the P1 helix) (
