<p id="p0055">The concentrations of chemical elements were determined by the method of fundamental parameters [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] using standard software of the spectrometer. Five areas with the size of 1 × 1.5 mm
 <sup>2</sup> were selected on the flat surface of each of the samples, each of which contained 100 points — uniformly distributed positions of the micro-focus of the polycapillary lens. Studies were performed with an exposure of 300 ​m ​s at each point. This corresponded to five local regions of the surface in which the intensities were measured and their averaged values were calculated. Thus, for each chemical element, the average values collected on the sample with a total volume of 500 measurements were used in calculating the concentrations.
