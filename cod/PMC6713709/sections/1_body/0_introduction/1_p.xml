<p id="Par2">Development of high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with large energy density, high power performance, high charge-discharge cycle stability, and high safety is strongly demanded to promote the use of clean energy devices, such as electric vehicles, to build a sustainable low-carbon society

 </sup>. In the development of negative electrode materials for LIBs, strategies for the materials design have been established and metal lithium or silicon-lithium alloys have attracted much attention as high capacity materials

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. However, strategies for such innovative materials to be used at the positive electrode have not been established because there are a lot of unknown charge-discharge mechanisms that occur at the positive electrode

 </sup>. To overcome this situation, researchers have undertaken cutting-edge analytical techniques to further understand these positive electrode materials and to create a strategy for materials design. Various kinds of analytical techniques, like two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

 </sup>, have been widely used in the research of battery materials, and these methods have unveiled a lot of information on the microscopic structures in LIBs, such as the partial structure of organic compounds at the solid-electrolyte interface, distributions of each element like lithium, metal, and oxygen, and cross-sectional mapping information in a large area of the coated electrode films.
