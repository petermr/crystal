 <caption> Comparison of real HRTEM and simulated microstructure: ( a) HRTEM bright field image of TaNbHfZr HEA annealed at 1800 °C for 4 days oriented along [1 0 0] zone axis and principal lattice directions. ( b) corresponding scaled simulated atomic structure evolved after 25 MC swaps. Ta, Nb, Hf and Zr atoms are depicted with green, blue, orange and maroon colours, respectively.
