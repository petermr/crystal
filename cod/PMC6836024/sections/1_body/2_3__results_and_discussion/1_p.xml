<p>The yttrium aluminum/gallium garnets crystallize in a cubic structure of Ia3d space group. The general formula of garnets is expressed as follows: A
 <sub>3</sub>B
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>, where three different metallic sites are represented by dodecahedral site (A), octahedral site (B) and tetrahedral site (C), which in our case are occupied by eight-fold coordinated Y
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, six-fold coordinated Al
 <sup>3+</sup>/Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions and four-fold coordinated Al
 <sup>3+</sup>/Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, respectively. The optically active ions introduced to the structure may occupy different crystallographic sites, which results from the similarities in the coordination number, ionic radii and ionic charge between the host and dopant metal. Therefore, lanthanides (Ln
 <sup>3+</sup>) prefer to replace A site, while (TM) mainly substitute B and C sites. Additionally, depending on the size of TM ion, they occupy larger (B) (ionic radii 0.67 Å for Al
 <sup>3+</sup> and 0.76 Å for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>) or smaller (C) (0.53 Å for Al
 <sup>3+</sup>and 0.61 Å for Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>) metallic sites. An XRD analysis was used to verify the phase purity of synthesized materials. It is evident that the obtained diffraction peaks of V-doped Y
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>5−x</sub>Ga
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> nanocrystals correspond to the reference patterns of cubic structures of adequate host materials (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Observed peaks broadening can be assigned to the small size of the nanoparticles. The 
 <italic>a</italic> cell parameter increases linearly as the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>-dopant concentration increased, which results from the enlargement of the crystallographic cell associated with the difference in the ionic radii of Al
 <sup>3+</sup>and Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions (rAl
 <sup>3+</sup> &lt; rGa
 <sup>3+</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). However, it was found that Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions preferentially occupy four-fold coordinated sites of Al
 <sup>3+</sup> rather than the octahedral counterpart. This phenomenon can be explained based on the stronger covalency of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup>-O
 <sup>2−</sup> bonds with respect to the Al
 <sup>3+</sup>-O
 <sup>2−</sup> ones and the lowering of repulsive forces between cations, providing stabilization of the crystal structure [

 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. On the other hand, the slight shift of the XRD peaks with respect to the reference pattern arises from the implementation of V ions into Y
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>5−x</sub>Ga
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> lattice. It was found that Y
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>5−x</sub>Ga
 <sub>x</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> matrix is a suitable host material for three different V oxidation states, namely V
 <sup>3+</sup> and V

 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The replacement of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> and Al
 <sup>3+</sup> ions by V ions is possible due to their comparable ionic radii, which in the case of four-fold coordinated V
 <sup>5+</sup> and V
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are 0.54 Å, 0.64 Å, respectively, and for six-fold coordinated V
 <sup>5+</sup>,V
 <sup>4+</sup> and V
 <sup>3+</sup> ions are 0.68 Å, 0.72 Å and 0.78 Å, respectively. As can be seen from the TEM images, synthesized powders consist of well-crystalized and highly agglomerated nanocrystals (
