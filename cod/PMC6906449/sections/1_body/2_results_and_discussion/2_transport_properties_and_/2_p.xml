 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> presents the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficients (
 <italic>α</italic>). All the 
 <italic>α</italic> values are positive, indicating that the materials exhibit a p-type semiconductor behavior. At first, the 
 <italic>α</italic> values for most samples increase as the temperature increases up to ~620 K, and then they rapidly decrease until at 660 K. Above ~660 K the 
 <italic>α</italic> values increase again as the temperature increases. Such a zigzag-shaped relation is likely attributed to the phase transition in the materials, which will be discussed below.
