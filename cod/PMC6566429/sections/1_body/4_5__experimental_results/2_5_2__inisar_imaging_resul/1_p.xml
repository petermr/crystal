<p>To verify InISAR imaging of complex targets, an experiment on an Airbus A380 model was carried out. The length, wingspan and height of the airplane model are 45 cm, 52 cm and 17 cm, respectively. The experimental scenario is shown as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f009">Figure 9</xref>. In the experiments, the A380 model was located on the low scattering bracket, and had a pitch angle of about 30Â°. The experimental parameters are identical to the previous experiment. Considering the anisotropy of the complex target, reflected signals with a large range of rotation angle were collected to achieve high-quality InISAR images.
