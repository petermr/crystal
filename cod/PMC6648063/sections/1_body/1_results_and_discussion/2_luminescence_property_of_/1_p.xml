 </xref>a represents the photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. By the excitation of 380 nm ultraviolet light, the sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> shows intense yellow fluorescence. The PL spectrum consists of the asymmetric broad band with the main emission peak located at 580 nm and the wavelength ranging from 450 to 750 nm, which belongs to the allowed transition of 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup> → 4f
 <sup>7</sup>.

 </sup> BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> can also be excited by a light source with the wavelength ranging from 250 to 520 nm, corresponding to 4f
 <sup>7</sup> → 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup> that allowed the transition of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>.

 </sup> The PL spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> consists of the main emission peak located at 580 nm and a broad peak located at 500 nm. The emission spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> may be the combination of multiple emission light of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion. The position and intensity of the emission wavelength located at different lattice sites are different. Therefore, the asymmetric emission peak of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is generated. In the matrix with multiple crystal lattice sites, Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is usually preferred to occupy the easily substituted Ba
 <sup>2+</sup> ion site.
