<p>In this section, the synthesis routes are enumerated, describing them in a general way. Further along in this review, more details are presented for each particular alanate. However, all of the alanates have the need for protective atmospheres during handling, synthesis, and actual hydrogenation or dehydrogenation reactions in common. All of the the alanates can be classified as dangerous materials due to their flammability when exposed to oxygen or humidity. Definitely, they ignite and release hydrogen in contact with water, some more violently than others. Thus, great precautions and security measures must be taken when working with alanates.</p>
