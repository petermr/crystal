<p>In general, the MR of a monoclinic crystal is asymmetric, with respect to the crystallographic axes (

  <italic>32</italic>
 </xref>). However, the inclined angle in LMO is so small (~0.61Â°) that the system can be taken to be orthorhombic within experimental uncertainty. This agrees well with the experimentally observed mirror symmetry of MR at high temperature and with the theoretically calculated Fermi surface (

  <italic>30</italic>
 </xref>). The unexpected breaking of the mirror symmetry at low temperature, nonetheless, points to a marked change in the electronic structure that can be enhanced by strong magnetic fields.
