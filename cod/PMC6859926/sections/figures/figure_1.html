 <caption> Superimposed surface representation of PP2AC and PPP5C with LB-100M/endothall positioned using the coordinates from the PPP5C:LB-100 complex. Red: residues that are conserved between PP2AC and PPP5C; blue: residues with similar physiochemical properties; yellow: residues with different physiochemical properties; green: conformation of residues unique to the crystal packing of PPP5C; orange: conformation of residues unique to the crystal packing of PP2AC; cyan: PPP5C metal ions; magenta: PP2AC metal ions; and grey: the 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarbonyl moiety of LB-100. PDB ID 2IAE (PP2AC) [ 11] and 5WG8 (PPP5C:LB-100 complex) [ 2]. </caption>
