<p>Metal oxides are abundant in the environment and have found many applications in chemistry. On metal oxide surfaces, water molecules often spontaneously dissociate, for example by transferring a proton to the oxide ion of the substrate. The populations of dissociated and molecular water molecules depend on the substrate, the presence or absence of defects, the coverage of water, the pH, and many other factors. Often, a mixed molecular/dissociated water layer forms at the surface.</p>
