<p>In the process of crystal geometry optimization, it was assumed that the montmorillonite layer remained rigid, the unit cell parameters a, b, α, and γ remained unchanged, and both c and β were variable. This paper selected the smart minimizer algorithm, the parameters were set as follows: The Root Mean Square (RMS) force standard was 0.1 kcal/molÅ, the energy difference was 2 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> kcal/mol, and the RMS displacement standard was 1 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> Å. The RMS stress of the cells was 100 GPa. The long-range electrostatic action used the Ewald summation method; the short-range van der Waals used the atom-based summation method. The vacuum cutoff spacing was 12.5 Å [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the spline width was 1 Å, the buffer width was 0.5 Å, and the number of iteration steps was 5000.
