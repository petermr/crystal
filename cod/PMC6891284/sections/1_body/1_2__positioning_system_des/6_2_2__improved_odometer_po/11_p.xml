<p>The traditional odometer positioning method has high accuracy and good stability for a short duration and short distance. However, for a long duration and long distance, it cannot accurately reflect the coordinates of the delivery robot. The improved odometer positioning method based on the IMU is less stable than the traditional odometer positioning method, but it can reflect the coordinates of the delivery robot accurately over a long duration and long distance.</p>
