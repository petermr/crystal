<p>In the CURATED database, covalent organic frameworks are labeled using 7-character strings (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>) that encode information about their structure (charge state and dimensionality) as well as their provenance (publication year, article ID, and structure ID).
