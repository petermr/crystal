<p id="Par30">The crystal structure of coesite-III was refined only at 27.9(5) GPa, due to weakness of the diffraction data in other datasets. At this pressure point, no additional phases (coesite-II or coesite-IV) were found, but instead several domains of coesite-III were observed. The number of overlapped peaks between the most two intense domains did not exceed 20% of the total peak number. The second domain is rotated relative to the first one by ~178.8Â° about the
