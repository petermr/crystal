<p id="Par16">Magnetic measurements performed by SQUID in the thin film samples are not accurate enough to conclude about the magnetic properties of the tetragonal GMO film (for details, see 
 <italic>Supplemental Material</italic>). The magnetic contribution of the GMO phase, subtracted from the diamagnetic signal of the substrate, shows no hysteresis and a small paramagnetic signal (χ ~3.10
 <sup>−3</sup> at 5 K). Besides, no relevant anomalies are observable near 32 K.
