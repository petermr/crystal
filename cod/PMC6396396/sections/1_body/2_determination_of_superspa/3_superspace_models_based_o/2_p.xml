<p>The geometrically optimized models can be used to determine displacive and occupational modulation functions. It is a common step to represent physical space sections of (3+1)-dimensional superspace models, especially for visualization purposes. These sections are subspaces of superspace perpendicular to the fourth axis 
 <bold>a</bold>
 <sub>s4</sub>. Different axis intercepts correspond to different physical space models, which in incommensurate cases only differ by a structurally irrelevant origin shift. Structural aspects of all sections are analysed in 
 <italic>t</italic> space, where 
 <italic>t</italic> is defined by the axis intercept. To determine the modulation function from the supercell coordinates the atoms of the supercell are embedded in a (3+1)-dimensional unit cell defined by the modulation wavevector 
 <bold>q</bold> and a basic unit cell (Pérez-Mato
