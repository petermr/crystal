<p id="Par13">To the best of our knowledge, hurlbutite-II, -III, and -IV are the first examples of experimentally observed inorganic compounds possessing beryllium in coordination higher than four. Moreover, it appears to be the first structural report on an element of the second period manifesting such increase of coordination number. In a framework of classical Pauling’s model
