<p>The highest LE values were obtained for light sources obtained from Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) ceramic discs and 375 nm emitting LED. The LE values increased from 130 to 186 lm/W
 <sub>opt</sub> with increasing ceramic thickness from 0.36 to 0.80 mm. This is associated with decreasing fraction of 375 nm LED emission for which human eye is extremely insensitive. Similar results were observed for the light sources obtained using 400 nm emitting LED. Here the LE values increased from 98 to 156 lm/W
 <sub>opt</sub>. The lower LE values, if compared to devices with 375 nm emitting LED, are obtained because a larger fraction of LED emission remains unabsorbed. Finally, the lowest luminous efficacy values were calculated for light sources using 455 nm emitting LED. In this case the LE values were only 55 and 73 lm/W
 <sub>opt</sub> for devices with the thinnest and the thickest ceramic disks, respectively. This is due to emission of such light sources in the blue and red spectral regions were the human eye sensitivity is low.
