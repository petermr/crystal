<p>In the geometric optimization, it was assumed that the TOT sheets of the calcium-based montmorillonite remained rigid, the unit cell parameters a, b, α, and γ remained unchanged, and c and β were variables [

 <xref rid="B37-materials-12-02318" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, the Smart Minimizer algorithm was selected. The parameters were set to the following: the RMS Force was 0.1 kcal/mol·Å, the Entergy Difference was 2 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> kcal/mol, the RMS Displacement was 1 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> Å, and the RMS Stress was 100 kPa. The Ewald summation method was for long-range electrostatic interaction and the atom-based summation method as for the short-range van der Waals forces. The vacuum cutoff spacing was 12.5 Å, the spline width was 1.0 Å, the buffer width was 0.5 Å, and the number of iteration steps was 5000.
