<p>In this section, we will focus on the development of the BO order in the vicinity of the smectic-hexatic phase transition. The smectic-A (Sm-A) phase in thermotropic LCs can be seen as a set of equidistant parallel molecular layers, in which elongated molecules are oriented perpendicular to the layer plane (
