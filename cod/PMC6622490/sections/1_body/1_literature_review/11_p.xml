<p>The piezoelectric transducers used through the investigation were (Q220-203YB, Q220-303YB, Q220-503YB, D220-303YB, D220-503YB and EH220-503YB) and some of their profile configurations and sizes are shown in

 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Through the experiment these transducers were acts as a transducer, which converts the vibration from the sound waves to AC electricity. The results of variety piezoelectric transducer to harvest and convert the sound wave energy are shown in
