<p id="Par5">In order to get deep insights into the natural sodium feldspar, the surface states of phosphor particles were analyzed in a detail. Figure

 <sup>3+</sup> respectively, it can be seen that samples are irregular particles. The sample before thermally-treated shows an irregular morphology with smooth surfaces. Contrast, the surface of thermally-treated sample seems to be etched and molten, and some small particles are observed, which are initially assumed to be the corrosion products falling off from the natural sodium feldspar particles during the treatment process
