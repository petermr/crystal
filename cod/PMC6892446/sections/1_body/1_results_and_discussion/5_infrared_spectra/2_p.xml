<p>IR spectroscopy was performed to trace the hydrogen bonds in all three oxohydroxoferrates at room temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The two different hydrogen bonds in 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic> give rise to one very broad valence band with maximum at 3189 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The spectrum of 
 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic> has one broad band at 3136 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with two shoulders at 3315 and 3405 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The broad band seems to be caused by the hydrogen bonds of the 
 <italic>Cmce</italic> modification, which is structurally related to the one of 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic>. The sharper shoulders are probably caused by the 
 <italic>Immb</italic> modification, which lacks an extended hydrogen bonding network. The shorter oxygen distances in the 
 <italic>Immb</italic> modification suggest that these bands have higher wavenumbers than those of the 
 <italic>Cmce</italic> modification. Similarly, 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic> shows a broad band with maximum at 3272 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and two sharper main bands at 3399 and 3446 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with shoulders at 3351 and 3494 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The strength of the hydrogen bonds of the alkali metal oxohydroxoferrates is similar to the simplest oxohydroxoferrate 
 <italic>β</italic>‐FeOOH (akaganéite), which has a broad doublet at 3480 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 3390 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>.
 <xref rid="open201900287-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> The energy of vibrations in the IR spectra depends on different factors, the Fe−O and 
 <italic>A</italic>−O bond length and the atomic masses of the metal atoms being crucial factors, so that a qualitative comparison of the hydrogen bond strength between the alkali metal oxohydroxoferrates is not possible.
