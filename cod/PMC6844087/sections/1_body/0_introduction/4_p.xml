<p>Although there is an extensive list of interesting publications regarding the sol–gel preparation of CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, there is a lack of a deep analysis of the process under a wide range of conditions. Previous papers tend to work under specific conditions, or only one variable is modified when its effect is explored. In this work, we provide a multivariable analysis, by means of the design of experiments (DoE) approach,

 </sup> to numerically quantify the effect of the calcination time and temperature. Thus, our work explores two variables at a time and accounts for their possible interaction. Moreover, two analysis cycles are performed to explore a wider experimental domain. The effect that each variable has on the chemical composition and magnetic properties is determined. This work leads to an optimization of the polymer-assisted sol–gel synthesis
