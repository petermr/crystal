 <caption> (a–d) Real and inverse space patterns for the zone axis [001] and [100], respectively. (e) Observed and calculated powder XRD patterns. The inset shows the pattern with hkl labels for the higher superstructure reflections. For comparison, we show the simulated pattern corresponding to the disordered crystal structure in space group I4̅ m2 with missing superstructure reflections. </caption>
