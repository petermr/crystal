<p>Intermetallic framework compounds
 <xref rid="anie201907432-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> constitute fascinating inorganic phases, in which a majority of framework atoms enclose a minority of guest species. In recent years, this class of materials attracted significant interest in preparative solid‐state chemistry and current basic materials science research because several members exhibit beneficial thermoelectric or superconducting properties.
 <xref rid="anie201907432-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> The structural organization covers a wide variety of compositions involving three‐dimensional frameworks usually based on four‐bonded tetrel atoms such as Si, Ge, or Sn. Generally, the connectivity of the network atoms is related to the electron count by the 8−
 <italic>N</italic> rule although silicon compounds may tolerate a certain electron excess.
