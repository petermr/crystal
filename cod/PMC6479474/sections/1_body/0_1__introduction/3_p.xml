<p>The nature of NIR spectra (overlaying overtones and combinations) [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] largely limits their interpretability [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Chemometric methods do not provide physical insights on the analyzed sample, and NIR spectroscopy is often used as a “black-box”. In contrast, for IR and Raman spectroscopy, this limitation is less severe due to its more simple spectra with milder fundamental band overlapping [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Coincidently, quantum chemistry offers affordable methods (harmonic approximation) for the adequately accurate simulation of IR and Raman spectra [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast, prediction of NIR bands require resource intensive anharmonic methods [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The difference in resource demand (harmonic vs. anharmonic approximation) is significant, and theoretical NIR studies of complex molecules have only recently appeared [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and long-chain [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] fatty acids. These studies could have been used, e.g., for the interpretation of the meaningful NIR bands that influence the chemometric models used in quantification of the content of phytopharmaceutical compounds in natural drugs [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. On the other hand, simulations of IR spectra in crystalline phase that use a proper representation of infinite crystal lattice by a three-dimensional (3D) periodic model remain equally rare.
