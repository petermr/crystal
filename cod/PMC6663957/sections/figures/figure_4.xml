 <caption>
  <p>Direct sinograms in the center of the 
   <italic>Scanner B.</italic> Rows and columns of the sinograms represent views and tangential positions, respectively. 
   <bold>a</bold> Sinogram of the plane source located perpendicular to 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis in cylindrical geometry, 
   <bold>b</bold> Sinogram of the plane source located perpendicular to 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis in block geometry, 
   <bold>c</bold> normalization factors’ sinogram in cylindrical geometry, and 
   <bold>d</bold> normalization factors’ sinogram in block geometry. The color bar in each row is common to both sinograms. However, for the cylindrical geometry, there are values which are more than the maximum value in the color bar. These values are depicted in white. Therefore in the sinogram (
   <bold>a</bold>), bins are greater than or equal to 300, and in the sinogram (
   <bold>c</bold>), bins greater than or equal to 0.0012 are white
