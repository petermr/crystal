 <caption> Crystal structure of cage complex Pd 2(stable E- 1) 4 (top left) and DFT optimized structures of cage complexes Pd 2(stable E- 1) 4, Pd 2(stable Z- 1) 4 and Pd 2(unstable Z- 1) 4. For clarity only one of the enantiomeric cages was depicted on the figure (carbon – black, nitrogen – blue, oxygen – red, palladium – cyan, chlorine – green, hydrogen – white). </caption>
