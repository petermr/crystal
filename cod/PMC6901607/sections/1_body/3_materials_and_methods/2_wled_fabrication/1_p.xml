<p id="Par16">Commercially available GaN UV LED chips with the emission peak centered at 405 nm were purchased. The quartz substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, isopropyl alcohol, deionized water, and ethanol for 15 minutes in sequence and dried naturally. The CsZn

 <sub>3</sub> perovskite NCs active layers were spin-casted from their colloidal solution at 1000 rpm for 60 seconds for different cycles (10 µL/cycle) which is then dried at an ambient atmosphere without providing any external heat. The four different emissive layers (blue, green, yellow, and red) prepared in separate quartz substrates were stacked one above another in the hierarchy of their increasing energy order in conjunction with UV LED chip to obtain white light.
