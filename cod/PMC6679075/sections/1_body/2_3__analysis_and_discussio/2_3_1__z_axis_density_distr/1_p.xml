<p>By molecular dynamics simulations, the Z-axis density distribution curves reflects the density distribution of the components in the montmorillonite interlayer in the direction of the vertical montmorillonite layer. Thus, the distribution and relative position of water molecules and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer of montmorillonite can be further studied, and the influence mechanism of charge density of montmorillonite on interlayer particles can be explained.
