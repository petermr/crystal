 </inline-formula>-phosphorous and black 
 <italic>Bmab</italic> (
 <italic>Cmca</italic>)-phosphorus have structures similar to grey-As and black-As, respectively. Phosphorus, an atom in the third period, also uses the 
 <italic>d</italic>-orbital in some cases depending on interactions with the electron shell of the binding partner. The 
 <italic>3d</italic> orbital in phosphorus, in addition to 
 <italic>3</italic> 
 <italic>s</italic> and 
 <italic>3p</italic> orbitals, may also take part in the bonding of crystalline forms by constructing hybridized orbitals. Regarding phosphorus and antimony, we would like to mention the possibility of controlling arrays in the layer with two kinds of portions similar to the 
 <italic>Pnm2</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>-As phase. The possibility of two-dimensional materials in which one-dimensional electron donors and electron acceptor rods alternate in a layer may be expected as a quantum material.
