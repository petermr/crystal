<p>The following conclusions can be drawn from this work:
 <list list-type="roman-lower">
  <list-item>
   <p>The reversible thermal induced phase transformation of Ti
    <sub>3</sub>Sn is demonstrated by the means of XRD and thermal expansion experiment;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The temperature of forward phase transformation during cooling is 270–300 K, and this phase transformation is reversible with a hysteresis of 10–30 K according to XRD results;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The phase transformation is determined to be a hexagonal → orthorhombic transition, the lattice parameters of the new orthorhombic phase are: a = 5.87 Å, b = 10.37 Å, c = 4.76 Å respectively, α = β = γ = 90°, the space group is Cmcm (No. 63). The atomic Wyckoff positions for orthorhombic Ti
    <sub>3</sub>Sn are also provided;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The orientation relationships between orthorhombic and hexagonal phases are suggested as: (110)
    <sub>orthorhombic</sub>//(100)
    <sub>hexagonal</sub>, &lt;001&gt;
    <sub>orthorhombic</sub>//&lt;001&gt;
    <sub>hexagonal</sub>;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The hexagonal → orthorhombic phase transformation is calculated to be reasonable according to thermodynamics theory.</p>
