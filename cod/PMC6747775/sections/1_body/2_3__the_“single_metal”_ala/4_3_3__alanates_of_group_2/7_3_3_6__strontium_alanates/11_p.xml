 <sub>2</sub> + 2Al (70 bar, 260 °C, two days) did not succeed. In this last case, stearic acid was used as a process control agent (PCA) to avoid the cold welding of Al during mechanical milling. Possibly, another PCA might lead to successful hydrogenation. Unfortunately, the dehydrogenation curves of Sr
 <sub>2</sub>AlH
 <sub>7</sub> were not presented in these studies.
