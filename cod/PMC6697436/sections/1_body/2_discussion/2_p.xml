<p>In conclusion, we synthesized high-quality Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> bulk single crystals with well-defined atomic surface termination. Our magnetic, electrical resistivity, electrochemical measurements, XPS, STM, and density functional theory calculations uncovered the local spin structure and ligand environment of the surface Co atoms. The results provide new insights into the understanding of the surface water oxidation process. First, the nontrivial surface states derived by Co atoms are robust to surface distortion and modification. They are located just above the Fermi energy and can accept electrons from the adsorbates. In addition, loss of coordination of the Co atoms provides new open sites for the uptake of OH
 <sup>−</sup> species. This facilitates the electron transfer through coupling between the

 <sub>g</sub> orbital of Co and the O-

 <sub>σ</sub> orbital of OH
 <sup>−</sup>. The present study provides a promising strategy to create highly efficient and robust catalysts by using the surface states around the Fermi energy.
