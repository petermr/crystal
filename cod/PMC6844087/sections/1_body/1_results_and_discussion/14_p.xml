<p>Now, it is clear that small particles have been synthesized, but due to the calcination effect, they behave as building blocks that sinter each other, forming bigger agglomerates. The size of the individual small particles is difficult to be determined with these images, but it is clear that their size is below 1 μm. Furthermore, by looking below the big aggregates, it is possible to find a distribution of particles that are smaller in size than those particles forming the agglomerates. This smaller distribution, which is considerably below 1 μm in diameter, may be a representative of those nanometric particles that have not sintered with others, keeping in this way their original size. Even though the shape of the aggregates is irregular, individual nanoparticles seem to be spherical shaped.</p>
