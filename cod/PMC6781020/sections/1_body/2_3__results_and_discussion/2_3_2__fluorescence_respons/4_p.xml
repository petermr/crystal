<p>Apart from the present SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs, the Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> detection has to be completed by other QDs in a variety of circumstances. Hydrophobic core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs were used for Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> sensing in organic solvent. A similar non-linear dependence of fluorescence response on Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration was observed [
 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In CdS QD sensors, the correlation was found to be linear at low concentration and it became non-linear when a high Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration was introduced [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, the sensing performance was found to be dependent on pH condition [
 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thioglycolic acid capped CdTe semiconductor in aqueous solution was applied as the fluorescence sensor, which could determine Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> without any tangible influence of a few interfering ions [
 <xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Imidazole modified carbon dots were also employed for photoluminescence sensors with limit of detection of 0.93 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mol/L [
 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Compared to those sensors, the present SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs show promising properties to develop photoluminescence sensors, which take advantages of the chemical stability, non-toxicity and low cost. On the other hand, highly sensitive spectroscopic techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and square wave anodic stripping voltammetric (SWASV), provide precise results with low limit of detection [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For example, the limits of detection of ICP-OES are 1.2, 1.1, 1.0 and 6.3 µg/L for Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Cd
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-09-01294" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, these techniques are usually of high cost and need complex operations by experienced staffs. The present photoluminescence sensor of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs would be beneficial to the design of in situ devices for heavy metal ions in contaminated water.
