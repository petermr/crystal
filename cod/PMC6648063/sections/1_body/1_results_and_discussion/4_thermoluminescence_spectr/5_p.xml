 </xref>b shows the thermoluminescence curves of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> at different excitation light. Generally, the wavelength of the excitation light is shorter, the energy is higher, and the rate of the energy storage is faster. However, the thermoluminescence intensity of the sample excited by a 250 nm light source is the lowest. With the increase in the excitation light wavelength, the intensity of thermoluminescence curve increases gradually. The thermoluminescence curve is the strongest at the excitation of a 460 nm light source. However, the main excitation peak of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> excitation spectra is located at around 380 nm. According to the analysis above, we can assume that the trap in the material has its own energy level distribution, and the lowest trap level must be lower than the bottom level of the d band of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in the material, so that the persistent luminescence property of the sample is better when excited by the blue light with lower energy.
