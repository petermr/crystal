<p id="Par64">In the Derenzo phantom, it may look like the image intensity is higher in the center of the phantom, but this is not the case, because the average intensity stays the same across larger regions in the phantom. This can be inferred from the line profiles where the peak values decrease to the peripheral area but the valley values increase. This is due to the spill-over effect that is caused by degraded spatial resolution in the peripheral area. The SOR ratio is another evidence for this effect since it increases at the center of the phantom.</p>
