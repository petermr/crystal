<p>Herewith, we studied the four CL-20 polymorphs and the five novel CL-20 cocrystals, as well as the sensitive explosive BTF and the insensitive explosive triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB). For the 11 EMs studied, we optimized the crystal geometries using the conjugate gradient method on a DFT level, with the initial inputs taken from the lattice parameters and atomic coordinates from single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis [
