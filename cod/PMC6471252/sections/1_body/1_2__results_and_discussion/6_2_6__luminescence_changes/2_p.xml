<p>Notably, the emission band at low pressure appears to consist of two components: one with maximum ca. 597 nm (orange band) and another, weaker, at about 635 nm (red band). As the pressure increases, the contribution of the red-band becomes more prominent, and at above 3.0 GPa, the contribution from the orange band is hardly noticeable. While the position of the orange band appears to be constant with pressure, the red-band maximum shows a small red-shift with pressure above 2.0 GPa (
