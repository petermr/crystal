 </xref>d shows the SEM image of a nano-Si/B = 1:4 pellet after sintering at 1175 °C for 40 h. According to PXRD, this sample consisted of approximately equal proportions α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>. β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> crystallites, embedded in a matrix of irregularly shaped α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> particles, can be recognized by their sharp edges. (Note that the growth of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> single crystals is not expected at 1175 °C as this requires temperatures of 1200 °C and above.) Most of the β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> crystals actually contain B-rich inclusions, which may be attributed to a heterogeneous nature of the α-to-β conversion. Prolonged (several days to weeks) annealing experiments using Si-rich Si/B mixtures with ratios 1:2 and 1:1 also produced β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> crystals (see

 <sub>3</sub> is a thermodynamically stable binary compound in the Si–Bi system. We observed that pure β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> samples convert to a mixture of SiB
 <sub>6</sub> and Si in a temperature interval 1250–1300 °C. The peritectoid decomposition is slow and cannot be recognized in a differential thermal analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiment. Similarly, and as already noted by Knarr,
