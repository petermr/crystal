<p>Experiments have consistently reported that oxygen atoms anisotropically diffuse through the oxide. An isotope-exchange depth profile study found anisotropic diffusion in PrBaCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.5</sub> with an activation energy of 1.02 eV by monitoring the differently oriented grains.

 </sup> Oxygen diffusion has also been investigated by computational approaches, but there are variations in the calculated results. A classical molecular dynamics study found anisotropic oxygen diffusion crossing the Pr–O and Co–O layers,
