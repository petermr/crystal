<p id="p0115">Natural zeolites are referred to a middle class of sorbents with ion-exchange and shape selective properties. In accordance with mineral composition the zeolite tuffs of the Yagodnisky deposit of Kamchatka are presented by clinoptilolite (up to 70%) and mordenite (up to 10%). The share of cristobalite, quartz, mica(biotide) and clay minerals is up to 20%. In accordance with mineral composition the zeolite raw of the deposit is referred to a clinoptilolite type, clinoptilolite and mordenite-clinoptilolite subtype. Chemical composition varies, mass fraction %: SiO
