<p>Thus, the crystal structure of the η″ phase can be described as consisting of twin (orientation) variants A and B alternately stacked along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis of the orthorhombic unit cell of the parent η phase, with structural and compositional modulation at the twin boundary. Details of the structural/compositional modulation will be fully described in
