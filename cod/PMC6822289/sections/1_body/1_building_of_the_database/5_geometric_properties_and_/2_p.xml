<p>DFT-derived partial charges (DDEC protocol; DDEC, density-derived electrostatic charge) are computed for the optimized structures, utilizing the electron density that was already computed in the previous optimization stage. These partial charges are already a valuable result of our study as it allows for the modeling of the interactions with polar adsorbates such as CO
 <sub>2</sub> or H
 <sub>2</sub>O.
