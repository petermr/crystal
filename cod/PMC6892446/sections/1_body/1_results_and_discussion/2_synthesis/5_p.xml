 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic> results in pure products, both in the form of two orthorhombic polymorphs that are visually distinguishable: square plates with the space group 
 <italic>Cmce</italic> (Pearson symbol 
 <italic>oC</italic>88′) and triangular capped bars with the space group 
 <italic>Immb</italic> (
 <italic>oI</italic>88). The ratios of the polymorphs in the samples of 
 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic> were rather similar, approximately 3 : 1 (Figure S8 and S9, Supporting Information). We were not able to obtain only one of the modifications by varying the reaction temperature or the base concentration (Figure S10, Supporting Information). In contrast, 
 <italic>
  <bold>K</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oP</italic>88) forms plates with a high variety of shapes for both modifications.
