 <sub>K</sub> and [Eu

 <sub>K</sub> represent Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions substitution for K
 <sup>+</sup> ions position, respectively; O
 <sub>o</sub> represents the position of an oxygen for oxygen in the matrix crystal; and V
 <sub>K</sub> is the vacancy of K
 <sup>+</sup> ion. Superscript “*,” “**,” “′,” and “×” indicate one positive charge, two positive charges, one negative charge, and electroneutrality, respectively. During sintering, Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ion replaces K
 <sup>+</sup> position in the zeolite. To keep the charge balance, one Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ion will substitute for three K
 <sup>+</sup> ions. Thus, two vacancy defects of K
