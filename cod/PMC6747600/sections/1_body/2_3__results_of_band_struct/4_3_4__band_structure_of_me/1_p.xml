<p>In CrSi, MnSi, TcSi, and ReSi, the Fermi level is shifted downward compared to eighth-group semiconducting monosilicides; thus, they demonstrate metallic behavior (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Solid solutions of the metallic and semiconducting monosilicides can be used to tune the Fermi level to a desired position. All these materials demonstrated numerous two- and fourfold degenerate band crossings at

 </inline-formula> point. In these two compounds, a band crossing at the 
 <italic>M</italic> point can also be clearly seen. At the same time, there is large background DOS associated with other branches of the electronic spectrum at energies close to these nodes. Therefore, it would probably be difficult to experimentally detect these nodes.
