<p>QD Vision Inc. commercialized their QDs using an edge‐lit QD optic called Color IQ, which works with edge‐lit displays.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> In this configuration, the QDs are mixed with monomer were filled in an edge‐lit high precision glass tube and the monomer is polymerized. The tube acts as a strong barrier against moisture and oxygen, and is placed between the blue LEDs and a light guide in an edge‐lit backlight (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0015" ref-type="fig">15</xref>a). The concentrations of red and green converting QDs are adjusted to pass trichromatic white light, optimized for spectrally narrow color filters to maximize the throughput of the filters and deliver a wider color gamut than can be achieved with yellow phosphor LEDs. However, a significant portion of the light does not make it into the light guide, although some of it can be recaptured by integration of reflectors. Several companies adopted QD Vision's Color IQ system by 2016, including Hisense, Philips, Seiki, Sony, and TCL for TVs, as well as AOC and Philips for monitors. Importantly, the on‐edge approach for the QD implementation in displays requires a smaller quantity of QDs in comparison to the film approach. According to the estimates by Steckel et al., the worldwide consumption of QDs for the on‐edge approach, assuming 100% penetration of the QD in the LCD market, would be around 2–3 tons per year. In similar conditions, film type devices would require more than 200 tons per year.
