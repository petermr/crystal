<p>Because the crystal system of SSZ‐27 is monoclinic, none of the ED data sets had a completeness of more than 90 %, which is required for a good structure refinement. Therefore, to improve data completeness and redundancy, several data sets were merged. We performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) on the fourteen data sets using the algorithm described by Giordano and co‐workers
 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> to find the optimal selection of data sets for merging. We have found this approach to be useful for dealing with large multi‐crystal ED data sets.
 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> The distance metric 
 <italic>t</italic>, which defines the similarity between the data sets, is derived from the correlation coefficients of the common reflection intensities (

 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> a), which facilitates finding a suitable cut distance, although finding the right value involved some trial and error. Finally, a cut distance
