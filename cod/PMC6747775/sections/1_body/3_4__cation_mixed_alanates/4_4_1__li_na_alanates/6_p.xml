<p>Dehydrogenation reaction (Equation (88)) without additives occurs between 190–250 °C and it releases about 3.35 wt.%. Further reactions involve NaH decomposition at 320–380 °C and finally the reaction of LiH with Al at 380–480 °C, with the formation of LiAl and H
 <sub>2</sub>. Wang et al. demonstrated a release of 6.73 wt.% and a re-hydrogenation level of 6.6 wt.% when heating up to 530 °C under vacuum, and 285 °C and 135 bar, respectively. Small amounts of Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub> have been observed during the dehydrogenation of Na
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
