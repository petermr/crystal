<p id="Par7">To address the problem, we first need to understand the nature of defects induced by helium-implantation at room temperature. We conducted a prior study on 3000 appm helium-implanted tungsten samples, exposed at room temperature

 <sup>−4</sup>) of the implantation induced residual strain

 </sup>. At room temperature, an energetic helium ion, creates numerous Frenkel pairs. While most Frenkel pairs recombine immediately, a few are prevented from recombining, as helium occupies vacancies to form stable helium-vacancy complexes

 </sup>. It was found that the defect microstructure in such cases was dominated by di-helium vacancy complexes, to which a self-interstitial (SIA) remains tightly bound (He
