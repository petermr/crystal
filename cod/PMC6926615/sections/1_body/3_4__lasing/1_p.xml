<p>The term LASER is the abbreviation for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”. Thus, lasers are light-emitting devices via a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission in the active (amplifying) medium. The first theoretical prediction of this phenomenon was conducted by Charles Townes and Arthur Schalow [

These devices found applications in different fields from everyday life, for example CD/DVD to fabrication and scientific tasks such as microscopy with improved spatial resolution [
