<p id="Par5">On the other hand, exploring of relativistic dynamics of interacting particles has been very attractive in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Although these topics have been studied for a long time, there are still much efforts to explain significant differences between experimental and theoretical results

 </sup>. For example, relativistic two-body equation was written first by Eddington and Gaunt in 1929

 </sup> which is relatively straightforward for interacting spin-1/2 particles since it includes approximate Darwin Lagrangian as an interaction term and 2-free Dirac Hamiltonian. This effective Hamiltonian fails either the velocity of particles or distance between particles is very high. Therefore, it covers actually weak coupling approximation.
