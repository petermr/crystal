 </xref>a (top and bottom, respectively). It can be seen that the charge density distributions at the Pb and O sites are essentially isotropic in nature for the paraelectric phase. On the other hand, a finite amount of charge can be seen in between Pb and O in the tetragonal phase showing the anisotropic nature of charge density distribution. So, it can be stated that in cubic phase, the Pbâ€“O bond has more ionic character and the tetragonal phase has a mixed ionocovalent bonding character. On the other hand, the bonding between V and O is found to have substantial covalency in both the cubic and tetragonal phases as we can find notable charge density between these atomic sites. But it may be noted that the covalent interaction between V and O in tetragonal phase is stronger than that in the cubic phase. Due to this, the V atom is shifted from the center of the octahedron stabilizing the ferroelectric state.
