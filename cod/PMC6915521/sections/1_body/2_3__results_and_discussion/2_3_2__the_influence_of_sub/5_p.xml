<p>In macro-contact mechanics, the stress distribution of two contact bodies showed that the maximum stress occurred at the subsurface. There was a similar phenomenon in nanoscale contacts, and the position of maximum stress showed a certain distance from the surface [
 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This distance depends on the radius of the contact body, the applied load and the material properties. If the defects are located near the position of the maximum stress, or they coincide with each other, the influence of the defects on the sliding process will be greater. On the other hand, if the defects are far away from the position of the maximum stress, the effects will be slight, and this could be the reason that the average friction forces become lower with the increase in depth of the defects, when
