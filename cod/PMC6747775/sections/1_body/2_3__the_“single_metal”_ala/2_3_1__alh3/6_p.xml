 <xref rid="B58-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]; however, ball milling has reduced the dehydrogenation temperature below 100 °C [

 <xref rid="B60-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In particular, for the alane, the passivation is somehow beneficial, reducing decomposition during its storage and handle in the laboratory. However, in general, passivating surface oxidation is a problem. It is challenging to reduce the oxygen and humidity content of protective atmospheres (argon) until acceptable values (&lt;10 ppm) for hydrogen storage applications. This means that a hydrogen storage system that is based on alanates (and hydrides in general) must have proper filtering, trapping, or regenerative systems to reduce oxygen and humidity content, which can be costly. Ball milling of alane exposes new, fresh, and non-oxidized surfaces that improve the kinetics of the dehydrogenation reaction [
 <xref rid="B61-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The dehydrogenation pathways, as proposed by Sartory et al., are presented in
