<p>Now we return to discuss the unusual temperature dependence of the asymmetry parameter shown in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>. According to the theory, not one single transition, but a sequence of two transitions (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>38</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>39</italic>
 </xref>), is expected. The first transition at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> is into a partially ordered state, while the second transition (into a fully frozen lattice) is expected to take place at ~ 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub>/3, i.e., around 8 K. Furthermore, the magnitude of the order parameter associated with the intermediate phase order should be much smaller than the lowest-temperature fully ordered state. Both features are in agreement with the data presented in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>.
