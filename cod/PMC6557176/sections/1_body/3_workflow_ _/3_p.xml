<p>The detector gaps due to the construction restrictions of the detector leave some inaccessible areas which might cause problems. Having the possibility of recording diffraction images at different detector locations, using either a goniometer arm or a simple detector translation, the software is capable of using several data sets to generate a single merged data set without detector gaps and covering a larger volume of reciprocal space [Fig. 4
