<p id="Par20">There are a few changes compared to the old model in our previous work

 </sup>. The most important change is the addition of the interaction energy between the jog with the periodic image of dislocation

 <italic>b</italic>â€². Addition of this term changes the modeling result in a substantial way. Briefly, this interaction cancels most of the energy contribution from the interaction energy between the jog and dislocation

 <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="">9</xref>), however, this term turns out to not contribute to the total energy in a significant way (after the first change of the model is applied). Thirdly, the inherent charges for the jog pairs
