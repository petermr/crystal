<p>Furthermore, around 140000 GB atoms were selected based on the coordinates of the mesh vertex, from which a mass spectrum (mass-to-charge-state-ratio spectrum, often referred to simply as ‘mass spectrum’) was calculated, which is plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225041.g011">Fig 11(c)</xref>, alongside a mass spectrum for the entire dataset. Analysis of the mass spectrum extracted from the grain boundary provides direct information on its specific chemical composition. The signal-to-background ratio in the GB mass spectrum is also relatively higher compared to bulk (for example at peak 13.5 Da, Signal-to-background ratio of the GB mass spectrum is 5:1 whereas for bulk is 2.3:1), which could allow for the detection of low levels of impurities that would otherwise be hidden in the background when considering the bulk mass spectrum. Peaks of Al
 <sup>+</sup> and Al
 <sup>2+</sup> are predominant both in the bulk and at the GB. Furthermore, the Al
 <sup>3+</sup> peak, which is a sign that the electric field is locally slightly less elevated, thus often correlated with regions that are less affected by residual gas, is not observed in the GB mass spectrum. As a result, peaks pertaining to spurious species, such as O
 <sup>+</sup>, are not observed in significant amounts at the grain boundary. One possible explanation could be related to the low energy configuration of grain boundary. One possible explanation could be related to the low energy configuration of the grain boundary. The sensitivity that we can estimate from such a spectrum is in the range of 150 ppm, and yet, no specific trace elements located exclusively at the grain boundary appear, emphasizing the cleanliness of the sample and the low energy configuration of the Σ3(70.53°) [110](1-1-1) grain boundary [
