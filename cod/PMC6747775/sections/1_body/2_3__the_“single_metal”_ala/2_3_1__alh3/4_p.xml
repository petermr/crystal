<p>According to reports, the alane has seven polymorphs, and here we present the four most frequently reported (
 <xref rid="materials-12-02724-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The energy of phase transition between these polymorphs is low: around −1 to −2 kJ/mol H
 <sub>2</sub>; thus, the phase transitions occur spontaneously at room temperature (adding complications to the crystal structure determination) [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The common structure of the alanes is corner-shared (AlH
 <sub>6</sub>) octahedra [
 <xref rid="B54-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
