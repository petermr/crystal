<p>Diammonium hydrogen citrate and urea were selected for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped CDots. First, diammonium hydrogen citrate and urea were mixed at a weight fraction of 1:1 and homogeneously ground. The mixture was subsequently heated under reflux for 15 min in air without any solvent. After the reaction, the mixture was purified by centrifugation at a rotation rate of 6000 rpm for 20 min [

Finally, the resultants were dispersed in distilled water (DW) such that a solution of CDots/DW was obtained at a concentration of 9% with a quantum yield of 16%. The yield of this synthesis procedure was found to be 55â€“60%. The overall process is summarized in
