<p>As for the conventional amplifying materials, the random lasing occurs in perovskite thin films with grain morphology, layered (R-P type) perovskites structure, or in ensembles of perovskite NCs, where the light is efficiently scattered on the structure boundaries. In work [
 <xref rid="B111-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], it was shown that in 2D hybrid perovskite single crystals grown by slow evaporation method, a lasing is observed at room temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f007">Figure 7</xref>g). The lasing wavelength can be tuned from 520 to 625 nm by engineering the perovskite layer thickness from one layer to three layers, respectively (

 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], it was shown that TeO
 <sub>2</sub>-based glass matrix with in situ synthesized CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs is a good candidate for implementing as an active medium in lightning devices (
