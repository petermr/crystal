<p>Reports on the synthesis of Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> dates from the 1950s [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; back then, the synthesis was performed in an organic solvent by the reaction between CaH
 <sub>2</sub> and AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or AlBr
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. As other alanates, the synthesis of Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> evolved towards the metathesis reaction between NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> or LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> in an organic solvent [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], to finally take advantage of the use of mechanical milling to perform direct or metathesis synthesis. As for other alanates, the synthesis in organic solvents, such as THF, produced adducts of complicated purification without decomposition of the alanate. Thus, the synthesis that is assisted by mechanical milling is nowadays popular [
