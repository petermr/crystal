<p id="Par4">Motivated by the above priorities of AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> with substoichiometric amounts of Ag in thermoelectrics, we believe that there is still some room to improve its TE performance. Therefore, in this work we prepared Ag
 <sub>1-
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>InTe
 <sub>2</sub> (here the 
 <italic>x</italic> value representing the Ag deficiency, and the Ag vacancy concentration (V
 <sub>Ag</sub>), V
 <sub>Ag</sub> = 
 <italic>x</italic>/2) and then examined their TE performance in the range from room temperature (~RT) to ~820 K.
