 <sub>2</sub> was produced by the metathesis reaction of EuCl
 <sub>2</sub> + 2NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> or EuCl
 <sub>3</sub> + 3NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub>. The reaction was performed by means of mechanical milling in a hydrogen atmosphere (1–15 bar) and different milling times (180 min seems enough time) [

 <sup>2+</sup>, or Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, the final alanate was Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, i.e., Eu(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>. Additionally, NaEu
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>6</sub> was observed as an intermediary. Eu(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> has a hydrogen content of 3.76 wt.%. Pommerin et al. demonstrated a hydrogen release of about 1.8 wt.% (including the NaCl load) in two steps [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The first step occurred at about 100–125 °C with the formation of EuAlH
 <sub>5</sub>. The second step occurred at about 200–225 °C. Further heating led to the formation of EuAl
 <sub>4</sub>. Rehydrogenation was achieved by milling at high hydrogen pressure (50, 200, or 300 bar). Unfortunately, the rehydrogenation was not achieved under 1000 bar of static H
 <sub>2</sub> pressure; i.e., the temperature of rehydrogenation was not clearly indicated without milling. Further dehydrogenation demonstrated that the two-step reactions and temperature range are kept. However, a drastic reduction of the hydrogen release was found (about 0.8 wt.%) [
