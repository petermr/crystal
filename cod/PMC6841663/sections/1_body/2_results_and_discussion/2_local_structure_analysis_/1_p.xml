<p id="Par17">To obtain complex LCP trajectories, systems were quenched from the temperature condition of the isotropic structure (
 <italic>θ</italic> = 5.5) to that of the smectic-like structure (
 <italic>θ</italic> = 1.5). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows a snapshot of some complex trajectories. The trajectories have complex local structures, but it is difficult to visually classify each local structure. First, we examined four conventional particle-based analysis methods: centrosymmetry

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>, Voronoi atomic volume, and the Voronoi cell topology visualization and analysis toolkit (VoroTop)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. The results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. It is clear that the four conventional methods cannot distinguish any local structures of ellipsoidal rigid mesogenic systems.
