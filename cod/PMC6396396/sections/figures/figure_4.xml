 <caption>
  <p>Vacancy distribution patterns of selected mullite supercells. The oxygen coordination spheres of vacancies are shown in green. In views along 
   <bold>b</bold> tetrahedra are neglected for clarity and octahedral chains are shown with decreased opacity. Views parallel to 
   <bold>c</bold> show slabs of the models of M25 (bottom left) and M50 (bottom right). AlO
   <sub>6</sub> octahedra are shown in dark blue. Each tetrahedral site is a potential site for Si, but in this figure Al and Si are not distinguished.
