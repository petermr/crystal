<p id="Par14">At present, the mainstream LED BLU light source arrangement can be roughly divided into two types: edge-lit and direct-lit. In general, the contrast and brightness uniformity provided by the direct-lit will be better than the edge-lit. Edge-lit brightness uniformity uses a light guide plate to distribute light across the entire screen. However, the light guide plate weight becomes too great for large size LCD-TV applications. In addition, it needs to have good optical quality, resulting in high cost. Direct-lit does not use a light guide; the LED array is evenly placed directly below the LCD panel, which provides outstanding performance in brightness uniformity and good optical efficiency [

Therefore, it is very important to improve the BLU brightness uniformity. However, in actual applications, the BLU illumination uniformity is difficult to maintain. The brightness non-uniformity will be significantly different when the module becomes thinner. In order to achieve a thin LED and good uniformity, it is more challenging to design a BLU that meets the requirement. This study proposes a method to improve the LED BLU brightness uniformity. The BLU brightness uniformity was discussed through the different LED emission angles and the different QD film thicknesses.
