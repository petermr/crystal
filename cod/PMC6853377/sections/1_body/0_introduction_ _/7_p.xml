<p>The instrumental key feature is an increase of the 
 <italic>dimensionality</italic> of the recording scheme from 2D to 3D. Common HARPES hemispherical analyzers simultaneously record a certain energy band (typically 10% of the pass energy) and the angular distribution along one line in the emission pattern [
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>kin</sub>, θ) recording scheme]. The present technique is based on full-field imaging of the 2D (

 <italic>k</italic>

  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub>) momentum distribution, as described by Tusche 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2015
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb74"> ▸</xref>). Instead of energy-filtering using a dispersive analyser, we implement time-of-flight (ToF) parallel detection of many energies [
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>kin</sub>, 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub>) recording scheme]. A low-energy version of this method recently proved high performance in the soft X-ray range (Medjanik 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb47"> ▸</xref>). The new high-energy optics records initial kinetic energies up to 8 keV. The field-of-view in 
 <italic>k</italic>-space was increased by almost one order of magnitude in comparison with the previous low-energy instruments (Tusche 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb74"> ▸</xref>; Medjanik 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb47"> ▸</xref>) by a modified lens design optimized for low aberrations at high initial kinetic energies.
