<p>In conclusion, BooT-PCA demonstrated its ability to extract information regarding the topography of grain boundaries from atom probe data by using the 
 <italic>Boosting</italic> object tracker on features observed in the pattern formed on the detector. This new method for data extraction allows for filtering out both structural features, including a complete reconstruction of the grain boundary surface, as well as a composition distribution profile, with the possible extraction of atoms located specifically at the extracted feature within the atom probe data.
