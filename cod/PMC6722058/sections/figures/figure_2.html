 <caption> Parameters related to the local environment of S-atoms. d 1 and d 2 are the two nearest neighbour Au–S distances and θ 1 is the selected bond angle between S-atom and the two nearest neighbour Au-atoms. Criteria for the S–Au–S and S–Ag–S bond angles ( α) close to 180 degrees are used for adding or recognizing the atoms in a linear SR–Au–SR and SR–Ag–SR conformations and 120 degrees for three-coordinated Ag–S complexes. Spatial fitting of ligands is tested with a rigid sphere (red dashed circles) in a perpendicular direction to the two nearest neighbor Au-S bonds of each S-atom and parallel to Au–P bond for phosphines. Distance of the sphere from the binding site S-atom is also defined. Here, the sphere mimicks the first CH 2 group of phenyl ethane thiol SCH 2CH 2Ph and the whole Ph 3 group for PPh 3 ligand. d LL,1 represents the distances between of the added interface atoms which are restricted by parameters when adding special local structures or when limiting the smallest possible interface atom distances. Colors: Ag: gray, F: green, P: pink and the rest as in Fig. 1 </caption>
