<p>Electron-transparent slices of matrices containing nano­structures are typically prepared by ion-beam etching techniques such as precision ion polishing and focused ion-beam (FIB) milling or by ultramicrotomy (Huang

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> ▸</xref>). Limiting possible modifications to the sample during the preparation procedure is critical for quality high-resolution (HR)TEM investigations. This is particularly true when dealing with very sensitive nanostructures such as wires or hollow tubes. Possible sources of damage include shrinking of epoxy resins during the solidification and curing process (Cairney &amp; Munroe, 2001
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> ▸</xref>), and the introduction of residual stresses and knock-on damage (Egerton 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>; Bowden &amp; Brandon, 1963
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb4"> ▸</xref>) during the deposition of protective coatings or ion bombardment. Even diamond-knife ultramicrotomy can lead to mechanically damaged cross sections and increase the likelihood of coating delamination (Lipomi 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb30"> ▸</xref>, 2003
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb29"> ▸</xref>), and milling under small grazing angles and lower energies during the final milling steps.
