<p id="Par25">Our in situ hot-drawing experiments were carried out with a Hysitron PI95 H1H Picoindenter holder, which was used in a Hitachi H-9500 Transmission Electron Microscope operated in high vacuum (&lt;4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> Pa). The MEMS heater mount, where the aluminum foil sample was attached, was screwed onto the picoindenter holder, which can feed electrical current for heating up the sample. The MEMS heater mount allows a maximum heating temperature of 400 °C, and real-time temperature monitor can be achieved with software control of an embedded resistance temperature detector. The cold end is a tungsten wire with tip radius &lt;100 nm. The tungsten tip is movable, controlled with a two-stage positioning system consisting of piezoelectric precision positioning and mechanical knob coarse positioning.
