<p>The benefit of first-principles calculations for the investigation of modulated structures was demonstrated using the example of mullite. A systematic study based on FF and DFT calculations on supercells of different compositions and with different Si distributions allowed us to determine for the first time the details of the ideal Al/Si ordering pattern in mullite for vacancy concentrations 0 ≤ 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.5. Quantitative modulation functions describing the displacive and occupational modulation were determined and compared, which indicated that the ordering mechanisms for all compositions are the same. On this basis a unified superspace model for the investigated solid solution range of mullite was established. A comparison with modulation functions based on X-ray diffraction experiments indicates that the applied method correctly determined the underlying Al/Si ordering pattern of the most ordered state of mullite. The sole energetical analysis of the solid solution range cannot explain the phase diagram of mullite. Nevertheless, a mechanism focusing on the structural flexibility due to the presence of oxygen vacancies was suggested to explain the observed stability range of mullite. Klar 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb39"> ▸</xref>) showed that the superspace group 
 <italic>Pbam</italic>(α0½)0
 <italic>ss</italic> allows one to derive the vacancy distribution pattern in mullite. As a consequence, the average structure and the superspace symmetry are sufficient to establish a superspace model from first principles.
