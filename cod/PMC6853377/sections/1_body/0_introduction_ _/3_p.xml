<p>Hard X-ray photoemission is characterized by an information depth of &gt;10 nm which has been exploited intensively in angular-integrating work (see recent overviews by Fadley &amp; Nemšák 2014
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> ▸</xref>; Woicik, 2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb79"> ▸</xref>). With increasing probing depth, the relative contribution of the surface is decreasing. HARPES can access genuine bulk bands, in particular for samples with reactive or unprepared surfaces. Hard X-ray beamlines with excellent resolution in the 50 meV range pave the way towards band mapping of capped surfaces, buried layers or interfaces in thin-film devices as well as
