<p>As an insulating material, polyethylene can easily cause electrical trees under the effect of a high electrostatic voltage field, which will eventually lead to insulation breakdown [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, global scholars generally agree that the space charge effect plays an important role in the insulation aging process [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The existing research has mainly utilized space charge limited current (SCLC), Schottky effect, Poole–Frenkel effect and hopping conductivity to explain the conductance mechanism of pure polyethylene or polyethylene nanocomposites in high field strength regions (non-ohmic regions). Some scholars believe that the conductivity mechanism of polyethylene under high field strength is not dominated by a single conductance mechanism [

 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but a variety of conductance mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Others believe that the charge transport mechanism of doped nano-polyethylene in a high field strength region (non-ohmic region) is dominated by ion hopping conductance, which can be deduced from the formula that the ion jump distance increases with increasing temperature [

 <xref rid="B14-materials-12-02657" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; other research indicates that it is dominated by electronic hopping conductance, and the jump distance decreases with increasing temperature [
