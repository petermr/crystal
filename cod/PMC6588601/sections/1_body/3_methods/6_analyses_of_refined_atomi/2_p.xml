<p id="Par35">Inverse Fourier-transform filtering of the complex diffuse-scattering amplitude calculated from the refined atomic coordinates was performed by placing spherical masks with diameter 0.2 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> around the features of interest. The amplitude of this transform was calculated around each Pb atom on a grid with a mesh size of 0.05 Å. The atoms that provide the largest contribution to the diffuse scattering features used in the inverse Fourier transform are associated with the largest difference between the maximum and minimum amplitudes. The distance vector that corresponds to the spatial locations of these extrema reflects a component of the atomic displacement that participates in the correlations yielding the diffuse feature of interest.
