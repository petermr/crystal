<p>The temperature-dependent PL decay curves were also recorded for Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) samples doped with 1%, 50%, and 100% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>. The PL decay profile was single exponential and the PL lifetime values were calculated employing equation 2. The obtained temperature-dependent PL lifetime values for those three specimens are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f004">Figure 4</xref>d. The exact PL lifetime values together with standard deviations are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Table S3</xref>. It is interesting to note that PL lifetime values of samples doped with 1% and 50% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> decreases with increasing temperature. However, the PL lifetime values of specimen doped with 100% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> increases up to 400 K and only then start to decrease. This shows, that the internal quantum efficiency of this phosphor is the highest at 400 K.
