   <bold>a</bold>) Principle of natural stereoscopic vision; (
   <bold>b</bold>) Mechanism of artificial stereoscopic vision; (
   <bold>c</bold>) Epipolar trinocular condition for automatic correlation of three images; (
   <bold>d</bold>) Distribution of the images (in blue) used in one of the measurements of the experimental system. All the images shown meet the corresponding epipolar condition to be placed in the same relative position in which they were taken; (

   <bold>f</bold>) Result of a dense three-dimensional point cloud; (
   <bold>g</bold>) A three-dimensional photorealistic model obtained after the generation of the triangular mesh and the texturing of its triangles.
