 <p>We have designed and prepared a novel cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based on SrCo
  <sub>0.95</sub>Ru
  <sub>0.05</sub>O
  <sub>3−δ</sub> perovskite. We have partially replaced Sr by Ba in Sr
  <sub>0.9</sub>Ba
  <sub>0.1</sub>Co
  <sub>0.95</sub>Ru
  <sub>0.05</sub>O
  <sub>3−δ</sub> (SBCRO) in order to expand the unit-cell size, thereby improving the ionic diffusion of O
  <sup>2−</sup> through the crystal lattice. The characterization of this new oxide has been studied at room temperature by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments. At room temperature, SBCRO perovskite crystallizes in the P4/mmm tetragonal space group, as observed from NDP data. The maximum conductivity value of 18.6 S cm
  <sup>−1</sup> is observed at 850 °C. Polarization resistance measurements on LSGM electrolyte demonstrate an improvement in conductivity with respect to the parent Sr-only perovskite cathode. A good chemical compatibility and an adequate thermal expansion coefficient make this oxide auspicious for using it as a cathode in SOFC.
