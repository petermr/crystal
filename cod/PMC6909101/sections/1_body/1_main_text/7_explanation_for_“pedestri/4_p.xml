<p id="p0645">Let us now turn to the second option, in which the wall of the potential box moves with friction. In this case, in the process of a quantum transition, because of the presence of friction, the wall will not have time to go to infinity, and therefore the rate of the electron transition becomes a normal finite value. In a real molecule, this friction corresponds to chaos, which provokes a very light electron in the oscillatory movements of massive nuclei “with the aim” to control their movements during molecular quantum transitions. As previously mentioned (Sections

 <xref rid="sec2.1" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="sec2.4.3" ref-type="sec">2.4.3</xref>), this chaos is called dozy chaos [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], since it arises merely in a transient state and is absent in the initial and final states. Because of chaos (dozy chaos) in the transient dynamic state, a continuous spectrum of energy in this state appears (see also Sections 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="sec2.1" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>), which is a sign of classical mechanics [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In other words, the whole theory of molecular quantum transitions ceased to be quantum mechanics.
