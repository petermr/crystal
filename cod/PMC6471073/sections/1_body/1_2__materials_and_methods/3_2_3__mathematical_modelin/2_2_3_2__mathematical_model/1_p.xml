<p>The study of the free vibrations of beams, curved bars, and rings can be traced back to the nineteenth century. Many hypothesis, theories, and methods have been proposed to solve the problem, such as the Timoshenko beam theory, the Euler–Bernoulli hypothesis, the Love hypothesis, the Hamilton’s principle, the Ritz method, among others [
