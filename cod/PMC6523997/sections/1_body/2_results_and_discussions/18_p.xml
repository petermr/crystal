<p>Although energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis clearly shows the presence of Zn, Br, Pb, and I (

If the chloride not bound to the propylic chain of the additive is introduced in the material, its amount is below the detection limit of the EDX. As reported also by other works, the chloride introduced to perovskite as the additive or dopant often disappears during perovskite formation as HCl or MACl.
