<p>An important step was the crystal structure determination of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> by Magnusson and Brosset (MB),

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> which revealed (i) the close relationship of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> to rhombohedral B
 <sub>4</sub>C and B
 <sub>6</sub>P and (ii) a rather Si-rich composition, i.e., SiB
 <sub>2.89</sub>. Interestingly, the single crystals used for the structural study were prepared from molten silicon–boron mixtures, i.e., at temperatures above 1400 °C. In 1998, Aselage summarized splendidly the state of affairs and arrived at the conclusion that α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> is actually not thermodymically stable. Instead, its formation is kinetically driven and α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> would form only under conditions of boron supersaturation of a silicon-rich solid or liquid solution.

 </sup> The salient question is whether Aselage’s insightful analysis is compatible with, or how it possibly connects to, the later discovery of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> from molten metal flux synthesis. In the following, we describe our attempts to uncover the interplay between α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> in the binary Si–B system by applying different synthesis strategies.
