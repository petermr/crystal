<p>It is worth noting that our findings are consistent with the plausible creep mechanisms. These findings also support the existence of two diffusion mechanisms of grain boundary diffusion and lattice diffusion in nanocrystalline NiAl. Based on the above analysis, it can be found that the transformation mechanisms of nanocrystalline NiAl in different creep stages are in agreement with the findings of Meraj and Pal [
