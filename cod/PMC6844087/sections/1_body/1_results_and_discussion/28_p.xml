<p>Again, all samples have their number percentage distribution centered under 100 nm, certifying their nanometric nature. No clear differences are detected between samples, which have a mean value of 93.1 Â± 1.4 nm. These results are on the same order as those obtained for the first batch. Regarding the volume percentage distribution, a curious behavior is seen: those samples calcinated at lower temperatures (#1, #2) are displaced to bigger sizes. On the other hand, the aspect of patterns suggests that the distributions are more homogeneous when the sample is processed at lower temperatures, which corresponds to a lower degree of particle sintering and agglomeration.</p>
