<p>The semiconducting materials used in this comparison, i.e., Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub>, In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub>, and SnSe, all belong to planar isotropic material. Therefore, for both 1D and 2D inclusion composites consisting of semiconducting crystal and isotropic Copper, two representative configurations were used. Assuming the local material property axis as u
 <sub>i</sub>v
 <sub>i</sub>w
 <sub>i</sub> (where the subscript i differentiates the type of materials), and the isotropy plane of material lies in the u
 <sub>i</sub>v
 <sub>i</sub> plane. For fibrous composite materials, the definition of the two configurations were explained in previous sections of this study. For layered composite materials, in configuration III, the u
 <sub>i</sub>v
 <sub>i</sub> plane aligns parallel to the layered plane of materials; in configuration IV, the u
 <sub>i</sub>v
 <sub>i</sub> plane aligns perpendicular to the planar surface of the layers. Besides the four configurations, the conducting properties of isotropic polycrystal Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> and SnSe, listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, can be calculated using Reuss and Voigt models. Since Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> and SnSe single crystals have isotropic Seebeck properties, their isotropic polycrystal Seebeck properties are the same as anisotropic single crystals. The conducting properties of the isotropic polycrystals are the average of the results calculated by the Reuss and Voigt models, which is referred as ‘Average RV’ in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02049-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, respectively.
