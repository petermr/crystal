 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>9</sub> value is negative (−7), indicating that 1B-Y PKG cannot render the red color accurately because of the lack of red component from the 1B-Y PKG. However, we achieved the highest luminous efficacy of 133 lm/W in this 1B-Y LED PKG because of the trade-off between luminous efficacy and CRI.
