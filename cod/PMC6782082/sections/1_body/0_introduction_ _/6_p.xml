<p>Note that the induced representations of layer groups, in general, could be extracted by the existing tools of the Bilbao Crystallographic Server for induced representations of space groups, like 
 <italic>SITESYM</italic>, but this procedure would be more complex and prone to errors due to the essential differences between space and layer groups (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> differences between the sets of Wyckoff positions and their labelling schemes, between the sets of representations 
 <italic>etc.</italic>). The aim of this paper is to present the site-symmetry approach applied to layer symmetry groups for the study of materials with layer symmetry. On the basis of this method, the program 
 <italic>LSITESYM</italic> has been developed and implemented on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. In the following sections, the procedure of the program for the construction of the induced representations of layer groups is described in detail, and its utility is demonstrated by several examples.
