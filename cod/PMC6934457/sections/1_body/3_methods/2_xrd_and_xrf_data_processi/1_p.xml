<p id="Par20">The two-dimensional (2D) diffraction files taken on each spot were reduced to one intensity vs. angle diffraction spectrum (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), using a modified RSM3d software package code provided by the beamline. The background of each diffraction spectrum was removed by subtracting the diffraction spectrum of a blank substrate obtained in an identical way. The region between 16–19 degrees was further analysed by fitting the curve to a combination of one Gaussian peak, one Lorentzian peak, and a linear background. The Gaussian peak width (Sigma) and peak position were taken and plotted out as a function of the sample x &amp; y position. Mapping the phase diagram process, it is necessary to introduce point-by-point XRF data to determine the coordinates of each point on the chip and map the components on the phase diagram coordinate.
