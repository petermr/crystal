  <title>Schematics of the experiment and optical emission behavior of the 2D perovskite (PEA)
   <sub>2</sub>PbI
   <sub>4</sub> under high pressure.

   <bold>B</bold>) A set of fluorescent microscopic images of a (PEA)
   <sub>2</sub>PbI
   <sub>4</sub> crystal taken at the same lamp power. A bright-field image of the sample is presented in the center, surrounded by fluorescent images corresponding to different pressures. At 0 to 3.5 GPa, the fluorescence of (PEA)
   <sub>2</sub>PbI
   <sub>4</sub> is equally bright, and the color is reversible by decompression. After 3.5 GPa, the fluorescence rapidly disappears and loses the reversibility. LP, low pressure; HP, high pressure.
