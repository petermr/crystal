<p>The computed DOS of the stoichiometric surface using the PP–PW (PBE+U) and AE–LCAO (HSE and B3LYP) approximations are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen that the global hybrid (B3LYP) and screened exchange (HSE) approaches produce very similar band width, shape and band gap. The empirical PBE+U method yields similar band widths but a significantly smaller band gap.
