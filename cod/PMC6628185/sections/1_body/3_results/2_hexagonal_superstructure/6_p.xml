<p>As predicted by the calculations, in the TSL experimental spectrum displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>c, we also detect significant spectral features between the TO and LO modes. Although the finite full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the phonon modes prevents one from resolving each component of the spectrum by eye, a careful quantitative analysis clearly exposes the presence of numerous, well-defined phonon modes between the TO and LO modes, whose Lorentzian contributions to the spectrum are displayed by solid lines.

 </xref>e is particularly revealing in this sense. It shows the residual plot of a fit of data displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>c where we include only the E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup>, TO, SO, and LO modes and a broad Gaussian to account for the contribution of the TSL modes between TO and LO modes; for comparison, in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>f we provide also the residual plot of the fit of the data collected on the two reference systems including the E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup>, TO, LO, and SO modes. In the case of the WZ GaP NW and the bulk ZB GaP, the obtained residual oscillates within 2% of the measured intensity, which confirms that all necessary contributions to the fits were already included in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>d. Instead, the residual of the analysis of the TSL spectrum, including the TSL broad contribution between TO and LO, strongly increases in the range of frequencies between the TO and LO modes and has clearly distinguishable features that can be fitted by Lorentzian peaks, further corroborating the quantitative analysis of
