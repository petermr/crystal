<p id="Par50">The key module of RBDS is the WAU. It consists of quartz Wollaston prism, analyzer, and mask (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Wollaston prism splits on-axis Raman scattering into two analyzer configurations 0° and 90°, off-axis Raman beam pass through the analyzer. Mask works as a spatial filter for improved separation between on-axis and off-axis channels.
