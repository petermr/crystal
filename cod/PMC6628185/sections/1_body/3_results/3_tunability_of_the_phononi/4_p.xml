<p>Let us now compare the spectra recorded on the NWs with slightly different periods (in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b,c) to demonstrate experimentally the tunability of the phononic properties. The quantitative analysis of these spectra shows that at longer periods, we observe a larger number of spectral features than at shorter periods which is in line with the prediction of the theory. It is interesting to observe that also the E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> peak, which is the other characteristic signature of these TSLs, obeys the rule regarding its intensity, which is stronger for shorter periods. A more quantitative comparison is carried out in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>d, where we plot the intensity as a function of the Raman shift (calculated from the TO of the pertinent sample) of all the measured and computed phonon modes extracted from fitting the spectra reported in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a–c. The NW with 12.5 nm period shows one more peak between TO and LO than the NW with 9 nm period, which is in agreement with the expectation of an increased number of modes in a longer period TSL, and the E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> mode is more intense in the NW with the shorter period. In the plot of the E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> mode, we also included the results obtained from a TSL period of ∼26 nm. As expected, its intensity slightly decreases due to the increased period length. The relative spectrum and analysis are displayed in

We did not perform a quantitative analysis including ∼20 TSL modes between TO and LO because it would be affected by a non-negligible degree of arbitrariness (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01775/suppl_file/nl9b01775_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information 6</ext-link>). The vertical dashed lines in Figure 3d highlight the good agreement between calculated and experimental frequencies of the TSL with 9 nm period.
