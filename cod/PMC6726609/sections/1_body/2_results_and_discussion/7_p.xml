<p id="Par17">The specific capacitances at different current density are show in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>. The specific capacitance of α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires are calculated by formula (4). The value of specific capacitance is 648.3, 597.6, 567.1, 536.0, 496.7, 475.3 and 469.8 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at current density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and which retains 72.5% of its initial specific capacitance. When the current density returns to 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the specific capacitance still holds high initial capacitance retention with 90%. For heterojunction α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> nanorods, which show a specific capacitance with 981.5, 979.2, 964.7, 950.3, 887.3, 872.85 and 854.3 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> at same current density with α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively, yielding a 87% of initial capacitance-retention ratio, 95.2% capacitance retention is still kept when the material undergo rate cycle from high current density. The α-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> heterojunction exhibit much higher specific capacitance, rate performance and stability than that of pure α-Co(OH)
