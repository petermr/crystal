<p>Complex 
 <bold>2</bold> likely arises through rapid addition of initially‐formed 
 <bold>1</bold> to a second equivalent of 
 <bold>L</bold>. When 
 <bold>L</bold> is consumed, further coordination of “Cp*Fe
 <sup>−</sup>” leads to formation of free 
 <bold>1</bold>. Transiently‐formed 
 <bold>1</bold> is believed to act as a nucleophile in this reaction, with the second equivalent of 
 <bold>L</bold> behaving as a formal electrophile. This is consistent with previous observations of nucleophilic character for the P atom in [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe(η
 <sup>4</sup>‐TPP)],
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0015a" ref-type="ref">15a</xref> as well as with DFT calculations, which suggest that the phosphinine moiety not directly bound to Fe is best described as an anionic phosphahexacyclodienyl fragment (see the Supporting Information). These calculations also indicate that formation of 
 <bold>2</bold> from 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> and 
 <bold>L</bold> is favourable by 23.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, and proceeds over a low energy barrier of 7.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>.
