<p>Polycrystalline Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>-doped Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub> phosphors are synthesized by means of a facile hydrothermal reaction. Tunable broadband far-red fluorescence of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> was feasibly achieved under blue light excitation by increasing the substitution of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions into Al
 <sup>3+</sup> sublattice sites. Na
 <sub>3</sub>AlF
 <sub>6</sub>:60% Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors exhibit an appreciable QY âˆ¼ 75% which is more efficient than some typical Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doped red/far-red phosphors, and the luminescence intensity and efficiency further increased by heat treatment. ET mechanisms, as well as energy decay dynamics of Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>, are rationally analyzed on the basis of photoemission, excitation, and time-resolved spectra. Non-RE activated red/far-red emitting phosphors in commercial LED further promote the design and fabrication of advanced pc-LEDs for photobiological applications.
