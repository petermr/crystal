<p>Validating that the temperature of the sensor matches that of the sample is an important consideration, particularly for powder diffraction. Powder is a poor thermal conductor, and even sensors placed close to the sample may report a significantly different temperature than the powder itself. In order to verify the temperature of the cryostat and POWGEN auto changer (PAC), data are collected over the entire temperature range on a material with a well known thermal expansion curve, typically ZrW

 <sub>8</sub> (Evans

 <sub>3</sub> is used. A parametric approach allows refinement of the temperature offset based on the lattice parameters (Reeber &amp; Wang, 2000
