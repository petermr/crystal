<p>Contrary to MOFs, the atomic coordinates of synthesized COFs are not deposited in commonly available standardized databases. Therefore, it is already difficult to precisely estimate how many have been reported so far, and an extensive literature review is necessary to collect these structures: they must be extracted from experimental papers, checked, and converted into a common format for storing atomic coordinates. Recently, Tong et al.

 </sup> published a collection of 280 structures, which were parsed from the experimental literature, and that we used as a starting point to build the database of frameworks of the present study.
