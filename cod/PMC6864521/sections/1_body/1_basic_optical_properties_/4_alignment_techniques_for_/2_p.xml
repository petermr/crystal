<p>The alignment of QRs with a high order parameter is critically important, and several techniques have been explored in this regard, including evaporation‐mediated assembly,

 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> While most of these methods control the assembly of QRs by an external force, for the most part they offer limited flexibility for the local alignment orientation, which reduces their prospects for the type of large‐scale fabrication required for LCD. In contrast, electrospinning
