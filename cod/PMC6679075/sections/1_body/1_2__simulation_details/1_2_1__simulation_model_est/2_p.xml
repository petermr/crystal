<p>According to the crystal structure characteristics of natural montmorillonite, combined with the research purpose of this paper, the layer charge density of the Ca-montmorillonite semi-cell is 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, respectively, and the following were recorded as M1, M2, M3, and M4. The substitution positions occurred in octahedron and tetrahedron, respectively. The ratio of the number of octahedral substitution sites to tetrahedral substitution sites is: 0:6, 2:4, 3:3, 4:2, 6:0, the following are recorded as 0-6, 2-4, 3-3, 4-2, 6-0, eventually twenty montmorillonite crystal models were established. For example, for a montmorillonite with a layer charge density of 0.25, the ratio of the octahedral to tetrahedral substitution sites is 0:6, which is recorded as M1
 <sub>0-6</sub>.
