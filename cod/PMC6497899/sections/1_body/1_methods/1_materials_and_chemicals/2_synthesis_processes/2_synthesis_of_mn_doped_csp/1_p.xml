<p id="Par32">The Mn-doped CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> was synthesized by hot injection method. Typically, 0.0615 g of PbCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.08 g of MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> (H
 <sub>2</sub>O)
 <sub>4</sub>, 1 ml of OAm, 1 ml of OA, and 5 ml of ODE were added to a 25-mL three-neck flask and dried in a vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h. And then, the flask was heated up to 180 °C under nitrogen. At this temperature, 0.5 mL of dried OAm and 0.5 mL of dried OA were subsequently injected to solubilize the Pb and Mn sources. Then, 0.4 mL of Cs-oleate was swiftly injected, and after 5 s, the solution was cooled with an ice bath. The QDs were precipitated with hexanes and ethyl acetate by the ratio of 1:3. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 5 min. After centrifugation, the precipitates were dispersed in toluene.
