<p>A series of high-pressure experiments were performed using a symmetric DAC with a pair of 500-μm culets. A gasket was made from a 250-μm-thick T301 steel piece, by indenting to 45 μm and subsequently drilling in the center to form a hole of 150-μm diameter as the sample chamber. Monitoring pressure of the sample chamber in DAC was achieved by collecting ruby fluorescence spectra from ruby spheres loaded in the chamber (fig. S1). Silicone oil as the pressure transmission medium was compressively loaded in the sample chamber to offer a continuous hydrostatic pressure applied on the samples.</p>
