 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> The design of appropriate reagents precisely adapted to the specific demand is one of the fundamental objectives in chemistry. Although the exact synthetic targets might differ, the aim is always the same: selective replacement of individual atoms or residues within a material to finetune its properties and by these means its reactivity or functionality. As a major drawback, it is still not always predictable which alterations cause the desired effects. Hence the benchmarking of working models along established concepts is required. The proper understanding of the structure–property relationship of a chemical system is vital for the improvement of the materials development process. Electron‐density (ED) investigations provide an ideal tool for understanding these interactions.
