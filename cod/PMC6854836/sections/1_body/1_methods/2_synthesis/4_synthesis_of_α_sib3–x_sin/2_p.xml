<p>Boron and silicon starting material were intimately mixed in a molar proportion Si/B = 10:1, and the mixture was pressed into pellets (6 mm diameter, height 2–3 mm). Several pellets (batch size, 0.5–2.0 g) were placed in a BN crucible/embedded in BN powder and then sealed in a Nb ampule. Batch sizes amounted between 0.5 and 2.0 g. Nb ampules were placed in a high-temperature furnace and heated in Ar atmosphere at a rate of 200 °C/h to 1435 °C, which is slightly above the melting point of Si (1414 °C). After equilibrating the sample at this temperature for 1 h, the furnace was turned off and the ampule was cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the ampule was cut open and the Si–B ingot was recovered and cleaned from the surrounding BN (if present). The ingot was crushed into coarse pieces (about 1–2 mm), and excess Si was removed with a mixture of deionized water, concentrated HNO
 <sub>3</sub>, and concentrated HF (volume proportions, 3:2:2). The remainder consisted mostly of black α-SiB
 <sub>3−

 </sub> crystals, with sizes between several μm to several hundred μm. The acid mixture was decanted and the crystals washed with water (3×) and ethanol. The crystals were subsequently used for single-crystal X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy investigations.
