<p id="Par12">To assess the quality of the orientation determination in the general case, additional analysis using exhaustive search of indistinguishable solutions over a range of all possible Euler angles was performed (described in details in Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). That search revealed, that all measurement schemes with only on-axis channels applied to samples with cubic symmetry exhibit an ambiguity where two different orientations produce exactly the same intensity measurements. These two orientations have Euler angle 
 <italic>ψ</italic> which differs by 180°. Adding off-axis measurement channels removes this 
 <italic>ψ</italic> + 180° ambiguity.
