 <caption> LC cell employing CdSe/CdS@SiO 2@polymer nanofibers and corresponding fluorescence microscopy images depending on the polarizer orientation and electric field. a) Polarizer is parallel to the nanofibers (0°), and no electric field is applied. b) Polarizer is rotated perpendicularly to the nanofibers (90°), and no electric field is applied (ON‐position). c) Polarizer is maintained perpendicular to the nanofibers (90°), and a 50 V electric field is applied (OFF‐position). Insets of the fluorescence microscopy images in (b) and (c) show photographs of the LC cell using a portable UV lamp for the excitation.
