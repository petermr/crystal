 <caption> Structural evolution of cubic LZO and monoclinic LTO under electronic excitation. ( a) Example of structural deformations obtained for cubic LZO at 600 K and 0.8% electronic concentration. The yellow, green and red balls model the La, Zr and O atoms respectively. ( b) Structural evolution of monoclinic LTO with 0.8% excitation at 300 K. Octahedral rotation and O 2-like molecule formation only occurs in the middle layer #2. A side view of the initial structure is shown to highlight the rotation axis and linear connection between TiO 6 octahedra. Each structure represented is a structural average over 1 ps. The yellow, blue and red balls model the La, Ti and O atoms respectively. The purple lozenge in layer #2 is a guide to the eyes highlighting the changes in octahedral orientation. An animated version of the structural distortions shown can be found in Supplementary Information. </caption>
