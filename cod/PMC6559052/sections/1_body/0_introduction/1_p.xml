<p>Understanding the interaction of water on solid surfaces is of both fundamental and practical interest. Because many materials oxidize in ambient conditions, metal oxide studies are particularly pertinent for applications. Titanium dioxide, in particular the rutile (110) surface termination, has emerged as the prototypical metal oxide surface for fundamental studies.

 </sup> After considerable effort, water adsorption on reduced rutile (110) surfaces is reasonably well understood: water dissociates at oxygen vacancies as well as ⟨111⟩ oriented steps at room temperature.

 </sup> Terminal hydroxyls are reported to form at the interface with liquid water without reconstruction of the substrate,
