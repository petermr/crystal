<p id="Par28">The comparison between ABP and AOUP shows the weaker stability of the cluster-crystal phase in the latter, due to the particle-exchange mechanism which does not occur in the ABP case. In addition, clusters start to break down for AOUP at smaller values of 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (for 
 <italic>N</italic> = 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>). The disordered phase in ABP appears for larger values of 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> than for AOUP. We remark that in both cases the active force plays a role which resembles the one of an effective temperature since its increasing induces a transition towards the disordered phase. In any case, the role of the active force reveals other interesting features, like the coherent motion of the pattern and the shape of a single cluster, which cannot be understood in terms of an effective temperature approach.
