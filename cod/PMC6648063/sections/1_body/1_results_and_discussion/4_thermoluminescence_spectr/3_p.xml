<p>There are two thermoluminescence peaks located at 326 and 363 K to the sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>. Thus, the two thermoluminescence peaks both make contributions to the persistent luminescence property of the sample. Also, the thermoluminescence curve is a broad-band curve and can cover the temperature region from 300 to 450 K. This indicates that the distribution of traps in the material is wide. Generally, it is believed that the release rate of energy in the shallow trap is quick, the release rate of energy in the deep trap is slow, and the duration time is long. From

  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>, we can see that the density of charge carrier captured in the shallow trap and deep trap is basically close, which indicates that BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> possesses not only the high intensity of persistent luminescence but also the long persistent luminescence duration time.
