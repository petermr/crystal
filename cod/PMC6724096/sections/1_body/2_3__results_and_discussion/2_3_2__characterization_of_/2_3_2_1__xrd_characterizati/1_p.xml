<p>The crystal structures of pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> were characterized by XRD. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, the positions of the diffraction peaks of pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> are the same, and each diffraction peak is the diffraction peak of the anatase phase (the corresponding crystal plane is marked in the diagram). Additionally, the diffraction peaks of pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> are the same. There are no diffraction peaks of the rutile phase and iron-related crystal phase in the XRD pattern, which indicates that the doping of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> does not change the crystal structure of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> does not form a phase alone. However, compared with the pure TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> XRD spectra, the diffraction peak intensity decreases after doping the iron, indicating that the existence of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> has an inhibitory effect on the crystallization of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> [
