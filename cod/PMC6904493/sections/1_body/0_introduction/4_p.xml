 </sup>, we demonstrate that many of plutonium’s properties can be understood in terms of a DFT model and strong spin–orbit and orbital–orbital interactions within the delocalized 5f-band framework. Particularly, the model explains the chemical 5f-electron bonding that governs the phase diagram, lattice constants, elastic constants, and phonons (δ plutonium). For ε plutonium the phonons and elastic constants have also been predicted

 </sup> but judging their quality will await experimental studies. Theoretical lattice dynamics for the complex α phase has been avoided, however, because of technical and computational barriers that have made it too onerous to investigate. Actually, to our knowledge, no first-principles attempt to determine the lattice dynamics for α-plutonium has been reported. The reason is that the low-symmetry multi-atom monoclinic cell does not lend itself easily to phonon calculations. Of course, the 5f electrons also require special care, related to relativistic and magnetic interactions, that further complicates the situation.
