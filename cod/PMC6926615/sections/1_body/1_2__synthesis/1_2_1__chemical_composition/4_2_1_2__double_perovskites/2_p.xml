<p>Along with Bi atoms, Sb and In halides are used in formation of lead-free double perovskites. In work [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], a double Cs
 <sub>2</sub>AgSbBr
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite with an indirect optical bandgap of 1.64 eV was synthesized hydrothermally in aqueous HBr acid. This all-inorganic double Cs
 <sub>2</sub>AgSbBr
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite crystallizes in the cubic space group Fm3m with a = 1.1 nm. After heat treatment at 200 °C, the crystallinity and symmetry were preserved. The atomic ratios of 2.18 (Cs):1.01 (Ag):0.91 (Sb):5.90 (Br) and existence of Sb (V) regions were found, which is consistent with the crystallographic composition and the charge transfer from the Sb (III) to Sb (V). In the work [
 <xref rid="B45-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the optimization of the colloidal hot-injection synthesis of undoped and Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>AgInCl
 <sub>6</sub> perovskite nanocrystals was described. The whole synthesis conditions such as temperature, number of ligands, and hydrochloric acid were evaluated to enhance the PLQY of Bi-doped Cs
 <sub>2</sub>AgInCl
 <sub>6</sub> NCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f002">Figure 2</xref>d,e). The undoped nanocrystals demonstrated emission at 455 nm and the Bi-doped samples exhibit a broad emission peaked at 580 nm with the PLQY of ∼11.4%.
