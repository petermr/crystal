<p id="Par44">Values of the UMAT parameters are listed in Appendix F of the Supplementary Material. In the simulation we make assumptions of isotropic elasticity, small elastic deformations and that all parameters on the RHS in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">5</xref>) remain constant (other than 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> and the independent variable 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>λ</italic>
 </sup>). Evolution of 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> in the unimplanted and the helium-implanted layer and the strain-softening for the implanted layer is done as described in Section 2.2.
