<p id="Par2">The extent to which a materialâ€™s structure is simple or complex reflects the amount of information required to describe it. The structure of silicon, for example, is simple because it is captured entirely by a handful of structural parameters. Crystallographic symmetry is clearly crucial, because it projects the enormous number of degrees of freedom in the bulk onto extremely few microscopic descriptors. By contrast, relaxor ferroelectrics are complex because their compositions and structures vary over the nanometre length scale, and so any realistic model must contain the positions of many hundreds of thousands of atoms

 </sup>. For relaxors, this complexity is considered responsible for their unusual dielectric properties. No model of a complex material is ever unique: different regions of the system will correspond to different individual sets of atomic coordinates. The best one can do is to make a model sufficiently large (and realistic) to capture all key features and correlations, and hence be representative of the whole.
