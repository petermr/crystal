 <caption> Number density comparison between KMCS (squares) and experimental results (circles) as a function of (a) different substrate temperatures for a 20 Hz deposition rate and (b) different deposition rates for a substrate temperature of 800 °C. White squares (□) in (b) represent different E s values used during simulations. </caption>
