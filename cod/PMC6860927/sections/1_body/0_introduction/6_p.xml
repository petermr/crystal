<p>We propose a method based on exploiting the variations in the hit density. Our approach combines the 
 <italic>boosting</italic> tracker with Hough transform algorithm, and principal component analysis (PCA) for automatically extracting the spatial coordinates of grain boundaries. We named this protocol BooT-PCA (Boosting- Tracking-Principal-Component-Analysis). This new approach enables 3D structure and chemical segregation at interfaces to be studied with high precision and efficiency. A pure-Al bi-crystal was chosen for the clarity of its crystallographic features. The application of BooT-PCA algorithm is not only limited to Al-datasets, it can be easily extended to other material systems where density variations in the detector hit map from grain boundaries are readily visible.
