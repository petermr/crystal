<p>To analyze the acoustic attenuation behavior of SCASs, it is worth remembering that they were geometrically designed in such a way that the bandgap must appear around 1 kHz, which in the scale model is transferred to an 8 kHz bandgap. This means that the only attenuation we must take into account is the one that appears in this band, because it is the one that is directly related to the behavior of the sonic crystal. No other possible attenuations that appear in the spectra and that are not directly due to the action of the sonic crystals were considered in this work. In the 
 <italic>IL</italic> spectra of both SCASs, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f008">Figure 8</xref>b,c, an interesting effect in their attenuation properties appears: The size of the bandgap increases after the airflow when the sand is accumulated on the basis of the SCAS, regardless of the value of filling factor. Thus, this effect can be considered as robust although it is especially evident for the higher filling fraction, as the thick SCAS achieves a very noticeable increase in 
 <italic>IL</italic> around the bandgap frequency of 8 kHz (1 kHz at the real scale) and up to 5 dB, while the thin SCAS prototype presents an increase of only 2 to 3 dB around this bandgap frequency.
