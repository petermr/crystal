<p id="p0765">This section discusses once again the role of dozy chaos in the elimination of the aforementioned singularity in molecular quantum transitions [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this section, we want to emphasize the fact, which is associated with the elimination of this singularity, that the chaotic nature of the interaction of very light electrons and heavy nuclei in the transient state of molecular “quantum” transitions is the reason for their self-organization. As a result of electron provocation of chaos in the vibrational motion of nuclei, part of the vibrational motion is transformed into the translational movement of their equilibrium positions to new positions that correspond to a new distribution of electron charge. In the process of completing the formation of this new distribution of the electron charge in the final state, the resulting translational motion of the nuclei is transformed back into their vibrational motion, but near the new equilibrium positions.
