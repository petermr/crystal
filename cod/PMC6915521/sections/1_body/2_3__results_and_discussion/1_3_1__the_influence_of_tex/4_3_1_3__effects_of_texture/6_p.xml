<p>From the thermodynamic theory in [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the friction force was proportional to the mean width of the real contacts in 
 <italic>y</italic> direction. With an increase in the orientation angle, the mean width of the real contacts will decrease, if the geometry of this system remains the same, and the friction force should decrease gradually. Actually, the atoms of the substrate are moved and rearranged all the time during the sliding process, and the difference between the mean widths of the real contacts for the different orientations becomes negligible. From the adhesion and ploughing components in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f013">Figure 13</xref>, when the orientation is 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0°, the proportion of the ploughing component is greater than the cases of 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 45° and 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 90°. Besides, the two components of 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0° are higher than the other two cases. For the cases of 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 45° and 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 90°, the adhesion component plays the main role in friction force, which shows in the influence of the texture orientation.
