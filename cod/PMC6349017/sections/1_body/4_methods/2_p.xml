<p>The ZnO slabs were roughly 1 nm thick and had 48 Zn
 <sub>s</sub> and 48 O
 <sub>s</sub> surface atoms per side of the slab, and were separated by about 2.8 nm of liquid water (

The production simulations were run in the NVT ensemble for 44 ns using a timestep of 0.5 fs, following an equilibration period of 1 ns. The simulations were run using a custom module
