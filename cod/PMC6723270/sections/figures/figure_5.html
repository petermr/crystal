 <caption> Nyquist Plot as a function of temperature for ( a) Mn4 and ( b) Mn8. ( c) equivalent circuit. R1 and R2: resistances; CPE-1 and CPE-2: constant phase element; and Wo1: Warburg open element. The insert in ( a) corresponds to an increase in the scale between 0 to 8 kΩ, The insert in ( b) corresponds to an increase in the scale between 0 to 50 kΩ. </caption>
