<p id="Par22">We have shown a method of die-free drawing from hot solids to prepare metallic nanowires. The nanowire formation is mediated by thermomigration along surface and then diffusive plating into GB, rather than by displacive deformation, so that single crystal nanowires without internal defects can be obtained. Between the hot end and the nanowire, a neck-shaped ligament usually forms, in which steep temperature gradient exists to incur thermomigration, such that a high atomic flux flows along the neck surface towards the cold side to feed the nanowire growth. The neck-shaped ligament containing a grain boundary is quite robust and its existence is crucial for stable and uniform growth of the nanowire. By manipulating the drawing velocity and direction, the apparent diameter and shape of the nanowire are controllable. The underlying physics is applicable to the preparation of other nanostructures.</p>
