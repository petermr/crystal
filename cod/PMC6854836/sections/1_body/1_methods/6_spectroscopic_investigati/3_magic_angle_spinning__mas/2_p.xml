<p>The 
 <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR spectrum of a powder sample containing α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and nonreacted Si was acquired on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 14.1 T (119.22 MHz 
 <sup>29</sup>Si Larmor frequency), with a 4 mm HXY probe. The acquisition was carried out at 12 kHz MAS using a single radio frequency (rf) excitation pulse of 1.4 μs and 60 Hz nutation frequency, corresponding to a ∼30° flip angle. A total of 160 signal transients with a 600 s recycle delay were collected. Neat tetramethylsilane was used for chemical shift referencing and rf power calibration.
