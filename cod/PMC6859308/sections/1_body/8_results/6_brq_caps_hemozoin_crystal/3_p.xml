<p>The cell was subsequently mapped by X-ray fluorescence cryomicroscopy. This involves raster scanning with a 30-nm-diameter hard X-ray beam, which causes fluorescent X-rays to be emitted uniformly in all directions, with an energy spectrum reflecting the element distribution in the irradiated volume. The scan provides a distribution map for each atomic element, but here we consider only the contributions of Fe and Br as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 
  <italic>D</italic> and 
  <italic>E</italic>
 </xref>. The similarity between the Fe map in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>D</italic>
 </xref> and the calculated soft X-ray projection in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref> enables an unambiguous association between Fe and Br distribution and structure of parasite 1, including hemozoin crystals and its digestive vacuole. Clearly, large Br concentrations are located precisely in the same regions as the large Fe concentrations of the hemozoin crystals. Similar overlap has been observed in every BrQ-treated parasite, while no such overlap has been observed in any of the BrQ-free parasites. In total, 7 BrQ-treated and 9 BrQ-free parasites were mapped by X-ray fluorescence cryomicroscopy.
