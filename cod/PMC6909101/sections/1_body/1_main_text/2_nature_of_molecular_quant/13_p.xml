<p id="p0145">The dynamics of the transient state in molecular quantum transitions can be approached from the other side, namely, from the characters of the optical spectra observed in the experiment. The discrete line spectrum in atoms is a direct indication of the existence of quantum jumps in atoms. The nature of molecular spectra differs from that of atomic spectra: they are striped or often even continuous, as for example in the case of polymethine dyes and their aggregates (see Section 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). The continuity of the spectra, observed for polymethine dyes and their aggregates, indicates that the transition from one quantum state to another is not a quantum jump but a transition through a continuous spectrum of electron-vibrational states.
