<p id="Par52">The most critical problem in optical path is related to the polarization artifacts compensation for each polarization channel. For this purpose, we performed numerical polarization analysis using Zemax Optics Studio and obtained estimation about LP and LA anisotropy parameters for propagation through each optical element (Supplementary Fig.

In order to minimize LP effects produced by the dielectric mirrors and dichroic beamsplitters during beam propagation from the laser source to the detector and from the sample focal plane to the WAU, we optimized the geometry of beam propagation as shown in Supplementary Fig.
