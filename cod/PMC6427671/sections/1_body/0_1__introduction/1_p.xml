<p>In many science and engineering applications, including the measurement of shock waves, compression stress near the projectile base, and pressure of combustion chambers, dynamic transient pressure is tested. Transience is a universality of these pressure signals, which are usually accompanied by huge shocks [

The problem is that the effects of the pressure sensor caused by acceleration (acceleration-induced effects) will lead to a large margin of measurement error. Consequently, it is meaningful to explore the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors for higher measurement accuracy and precision [
