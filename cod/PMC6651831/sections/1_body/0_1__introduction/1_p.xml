<p>Thermoelectric material can transform thermal energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Its applications can be found in various fields such as temperature measurement, power generation, temperature control, etc. Conventional thermoelectric devices consist of both n-type and p-type thermoelectric legs. Within each leg, the heat flux and electrical current flow are parallel to each other [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Transverse thermoelectric devices make use of the transverse Seebeck effect so that the electrical current and heat flux flow perpendicular to each other [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are four main types of transverse thermoelectric materials, which are anisotropic single-crystal material, polycrystal material with engineered anisotropy, anisotropic organic thin-film thermoelectrics, and anisotropic thermoelectric composites. The single-crystal material anisotropy is the result of an unsymmetrical lattice structure [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; the material anisotropy in polycrystal is contributed to by both the lattice structure of the grain crystal and the grain geometry [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The organic materials anisotropic property is caused by the preferred alignment of polymer chains [
