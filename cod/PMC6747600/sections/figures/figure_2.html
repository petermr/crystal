 <caption> Band structure of CrSi, MnSi, FeSi, and CoSi with B20 (P2 1 3, #198) crystal structure. Energy is measured relative to fourfold band crossing at Î“ point. Dash-dotted line shows Fermi level position. Dotted lines on FeSi panel indicate the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) energies along high-symmetry directions. </caption>
