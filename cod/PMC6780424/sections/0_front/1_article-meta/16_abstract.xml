 <p>Understanding the reaction initiation of energetic single crystals under external stimuli is a long-term challenge in the field of high energy density materials. Herewith, we developed an

  <italic>initio</italic> molecular dynamics method based on the multiscale shock technique (MSST) and reported the reaction initiation mechanism by performing large-scale simulations for the sensitive explosive benzotrifuroxan (BTF), insensitive explosive triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), four polymorphs of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) pristine crystals and five novel CL-20 cocrystals. A theoretical indicator,

  </italic>, the delay of decomposition reaction under shock, was proposed to characterize the shock sensitivity of energetic single crystal, which was proved to be reliable and satisfactorily consistent with experiments. We found that it was the coupling of heat and pressure that drove the shock reaction, wherein the vibrational spectra, the specific heat capacity, as well as the strength of the trigger bonds were the determinants of the shock sensitivity. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds were found to effectively buffer the system from heating, thereby delaying the decomposition reaction and reducing the shock sensitivity of the energetic single crystal. Theoretical rules for synthesizing novel energetic materials with low shock sensitivity were given. Our work is expected to provide a useful reference for the understanding, certifying and adjusting of the shock sensitivity of novel energetic materials.
