<p>A fundamental understanding of functional nanomaterials requires in-depth analysis procedures to determine morphology, defects (Kienle &amp; Simon, 2002
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb24"> ▸</xref>), interfaces (Wen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb57"> ▸</xref>), doping (Lu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb35"> ▸</xref>), band structure (Shi 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb45"> ▸</xref>) and local deformation behaviour, as all of these aspects contribute to and affect the final device properties. In this pursuit, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers a variety of techniques from structure determination up to nanoscale chemical analysis. Optimized sample preparation is perhaps the most critical and challenging prerequisite for these TEM techniques, and the sample preparation must be tailored to the specific task and scientific issue (Jia 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb22"> ▸</xref>). Site-specific sectioning along selective crystal orientations is critical for structure–property investigations of anisotropic nanostructures including buried defects (Hrkac 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> ▸</xref>), and strain and chemical integrity at interfaces (Abes 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"> ▸</xref>; Hrkac 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> ▸</xref>; Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb28"> ▸</xref>), platinum (Giannuzzi &amp; Stevie, 1999
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"> ▸</xref>), carbon (Leer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> ▸</xref>; Baram &amp; Kaplan, 2008
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb2"> ▸</xref>) or aluminium oxide (Stiegler 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
