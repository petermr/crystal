<p>We found excellent film formation with 3-CPACl, characterized by a propylic chain at whose ends an amine group and a chlorine are present. Thus, we introduce 2% of 3-CPACl in the solution of the pristine perovskite containing Zn(II). The acidic part of 3-CPACl improves solubility of PbI
 <sub>2</sub> in DMF, as also observed for other additives as HI,

 </sup> while the chlorine bound to the propylic chain (acting as a soft Lewis base) chelates temporarily the Pb
