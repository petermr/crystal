<p>Subsequent to publication of this study, we obtained crystals that yielded slightly better diffraction data for the 
 <italic>Tm</italic>TsaBDE complex (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These data resulted in improved electron density maps and allowed us to identify and correct a few errors in the previously deposited structure (originally deposited as PDB 6FPE). The latter (which is still available for download and comparison, at
