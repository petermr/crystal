  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) A simulation of the maximum size-dependent enhancement at the hotspot between two shell-isolated Ag nanoparticles (Ag SHIN) as calculated by 3D-FDTD simulations (inset). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the synthesis of Au@Ag SHINs. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Maximum enhancement factors calculated by 3D-FDTD simulation for 100-nm-diameter Au@AgSHINs with different Au core sizes. (
   <bold>D</bold>) HAADF-STEM image with corresponding EDS mapping images of Au@Ag SHINs. (
   <bold>E</bold>) A series of SHINER spectra of DPA-TPM-G4 acquired with Au@Ag SHINs having 70-, 100-, and 115-nm particle sizes, compared with a normal Raman spectrum acquired without SHINs as a reference. Inset: Raman enhancement ratios calculated by comparing the signal intensities in SHINER spectra and a standard normal Raman spectrum acquired without SHINs.
