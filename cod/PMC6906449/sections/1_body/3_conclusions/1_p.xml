<p id="Par28">In this work we prepared the Ag
 <sub>1-
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>InTe
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0–0.2) with substoichiometric amounts of Ag and examined their thermoelectric performance. The analyses reveal that the main phase AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub> undergoes phase transitions at ~620 K and ~655 K, even though there are minor impurity phases (element Te and/or AgTe
 <sub>3</sub>) precipitated. Upon the increasing of silver vacancy (V
 <sub>Ag</sub>) concentration, an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (
 <italic>κ</italic>
 <sub>L</sub> = 0.1 Wm
 <sup>−1</sup>K
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.15 was attained, and a more than 2-fold enhancement in ZT value achieved at 814 K compared to the pristine AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub>. Besides, the origin of the ultralow lattice part 
 <italic>κ</italic>
 <sub>L</sub> is decoupled and elucidated using the Callaway model, proving that the silver vacancy concentration engineering is still an effective way to manipulate the thermoelectric performance of AgInTe
 <sub>2</sub>.
