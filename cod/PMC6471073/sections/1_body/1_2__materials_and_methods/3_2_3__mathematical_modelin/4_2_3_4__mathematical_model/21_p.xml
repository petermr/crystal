<p>In summary, by using the analysis algorithm based on CMS technique, the natural frequency and mode shapes of each ring and spoke in the complex DRG structure can be calculated. Even though the simple analytical solution cannot be obtained due to the complex structure, the analysis algorithm can be easily achieved by computing software such as MATLAB and it is very useful for the analysis of the multiring resonators. The process of the algorithm is summarized in
