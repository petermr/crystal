<p id="Par10">MMC NPT simulations were run for a system of 2000 atoms with periodic boundary conditions and a cutoff radius of 2.381 nm at a constant pressure of 101.325 kPa. At the alloy eutectic concentration, the computational box had 648 sodium atoms and 1352 potassium atoms. The SMA model potential was used to compute the potential energy of the atomic configurations. The initial configuration had the sodium atoms randomly distributed in the sites of a perfect bcc lattice at the pure potassium experimental density. The remaining sites were populated with potassium atoms. A new system configuration is generated once each of the 2000 atoms was attempted a move of a fixed length step in random direction. The magnitude of the atomic movements was dynamically adjusted throughout the simulation to maintain approximately a 50% rejection rate of attempted atomic moves. The volume change of the computational box was attempted once every passage over the 2000 attempted atomic moves at constant volume. Typically, in order to obtain the average values reported in the next section, 2 million passages through the full 2000 atoms were attempted after the system was sought to be in equilibrium.</p>
