<p>Magic formulas for the topological indices are detailed in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab23" ref-type="table">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab24" ref-type="table">24</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="Tab25" ref-type="table">25</xref>. The four indices we analyze depend only on 
 <italic>n</italic>, the number of shells in the cluster. Looking at the results, the simple cubic lattice as the least complex structure, also has the “simplest” formulas. In spite of our efforts, we are unable to solve for the Szeged index of bcc cubes. No stable solution was found. In general, fcc structures are easier to solve for topological formulas. We were not able to solve any hcp structures and only a few bcc structures. This may be related to the topological complexity as the fcc lattice is simpler than the bcc or hcp, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab22" ref-type="table">22</xref>. Within the tables, we provide formulas for the cuboctahedron, icosahedron, and decahedron. We previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] provided tables of numeric data for these indices, with the caveat that the cuboctahedron in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] had different magic numbers. Here we see that the tabulated data may be succinctly summarized as magic formulas. Also the degree of the polynomial of the index follows the rules from 3D space [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Some topological indices for the Platonic solids have previously been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. From this reference, we verify the Wiener index for all five solids for 
 <italic>n</italic>=1. The Wiener index for rows of unit cells of the fcc lattice has been studied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], but our results cannot be compared since we study clusters.
