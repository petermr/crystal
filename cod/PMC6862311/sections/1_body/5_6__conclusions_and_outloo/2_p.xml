<p>Another type of orientational order, so-called bond-orientational order, is related not to the orientation of individual particles, but to the orientation of imaginary “bonds” between them. First discovered in a process of 2D crystal melting, it was realized later that the BO order can also exist in 3D systems. These includes the so-called stacked hexatic phase, where the BO order exists across the 2D molecular layers, and also “true” 3D systems, for example colloids, glasses and quasicrystals, in which particles form local 3D clusters of certain symmetry. Nowadays, such complex materials as mesocrystals can be synthesized, which can be seen as a superlattice formed by oriented nanoparticles. The orientation of the atomic lattice of individual nanoparticles with respect to the crystallographic directions of the superlattice plays an essential role in the electrical properties of mesocrystals. The appearance of such new complex materials with intricate relations between the structure and functional properties require the development of new methods for characterization of these systems.</p>
