<p>In this review, we report on basic concepts and recent applications of angular X-ray cross-correlation analysis (AXCCA) [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a novel method which is capable to provide insights into orientational order in the system and characterize it quantitatively. Initially, this method was proposed by Z. Kam [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to determine the structure of bioparticles by analyzing angular correlations of the scattered intensity from a dilute solution of identical particles. In parallel, the first measurements of angular correlations in structural studies of colloidal systems were reported using light scattering in optical range [

 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the last decade, it was realized that the analysis of X-ray angular correlations can provide otherwise hidden information on the structure of a dense systems, such as colloids [

 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-03464" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and mesocrystals [
