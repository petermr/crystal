<p>As one can note for the COF 05000N2 structure,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
 </sup> we already find the minimum in the first stage, and there is no apparent need for stages two and three. For COF 05001N2, however, the MD “shaking” of the structure results in it finding a more stable minimum that is 13.7 meV/atom more stable. This final optimization results from a shifting of the perfectly eclipsed layers in the reported structure, coherently with the work of Lukose et al.
