<p>By accurately controlling the concentration of QRs in the solution and by slowing down the solvent evaporation process, it is possible to prepare films of close‐packed QRs floating on the surface of water organized in nematic and/or smectic phases, as shown in

 </xref>. The tendency toward self‐organization of monodisperse QRs can be understood in terms of surface tension balance. When a small volume of a concentrated organic solution of QRs is spread onto a water surface, slow and uniform solvent evaporation leads to a continuous increase of their concentration in the remaining droplet. As soon as the solvent evaporates, hydrophobic and dipolar interactions among the surfactant coated QRs are progressively enhanced due to their gradually increasing concentration in the organic phase and thus shortening of the interparticle distance. Such intermolecular forces induce segregation of the QR in close‐packed lateral ribbon superstructures or rod/raft aggregates, as a means of decreasing the overall surface energy and interfacial energy of the system.
