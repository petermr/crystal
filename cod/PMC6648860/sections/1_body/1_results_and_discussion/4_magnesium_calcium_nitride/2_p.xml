 </sup> However, several diffraction peaks show a clear splitting [e.g., reflections 012, 015, 018 of 
 <italic>R</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic>] indicating lower symmetry. As an alternative, we used the structural model with monoclinic space group

 </sup>) or, most likely in view of DFT results (see below), to vacancy/calcium ordering related to Ca deficiency

 </sup> Besides, the background of the pattern indicates presence of a relevant amount of amorphous phase, which was quantified (by adding a 20% wt of SiO
