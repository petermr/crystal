<p>Another aspect that deserves mention here is the stability of WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. It is well known that the surface of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is quite sensitive and can undergo oxidation in air. Previous works (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>33</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>36</italic>
 </xref>) have investigated in detail the physical and chemical properties of this surface oxide using a range of techniques including Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrical transport studies. The surface oxide forms through evolution of W─O (WO
 <sub>x</sub>) and Te─O (TeO
 <sub>2</sub>) secondary bonds at the surface of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> in air. The WTe
 <sub>2</sub> oxidation is a self-limiting process (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>35</italic>
 </xref>) and results in an amorphous surface oxide layer, which is about 2 nm thick (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>34</italic>
 </xref>). To independently determine time-dependent thickness evolution of the surface oxide, we performed ellipsometry measurements (see section S2 and fig. S2). From our measurements, we find that the thickness of surface oxide saturates at about 2.5 nm after several hours of atmospheric exposure (fig. S2). These results thus are consistent with earlier published reports (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>34</italic>
 </xref>). The exposure time for surface oxide formation ranges from a few hours to days (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>37</italic>
 </xref>). The bulk crystals and relatively thick WTe
 <sub>2</sub> samples are more stable in air compared to samples with just few layers, especially monolayer and bilayer WTe
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>35</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>36</italic>
 </xref>). Moreover, there is no polar space group in amorphous materials, and ferroelectricity cannot arise as it exists only in crystalline materials. This is the very reason that, in the literature, there are no publications reporting on the observation of existing ferroelectric domains or domain-like features using PFM in amorphous materials. Nevertheless, we performed the measurements presented in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> on a freshly cleaved atomically smooth WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single crystal in a controlled N
 <sub>2</sub> environment (see also fig. S1), and thus, the observed behavior cannot be ascribed to the surface oxide.
