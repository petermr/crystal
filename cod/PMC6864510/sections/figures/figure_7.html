 <caption> a) Absorption (black) and emission (red, excited at 380 nm) spectra for ( N‐MEDA)[PbBr 4]. b) Chromaticity coordinates (CIE) of white light emitters. Inset: photograph of luminescence from powders and solar spectrum (orange) with the visible region shaded in yellow and emission spectra of ( N‐MEDA)[PbBr 4] (red, excited at 380 nm) and ( N‐MEDA)[PbBr 3.5Cl 0.5] (black, excited at 360 nm). Reproduced with permission. 11 Copyright 2014, American Chemical Society. c) X‐ray crystal structure of the (110) perovskite (EDBE)PbBr 4, and its emission spanning the entire visible spectrum. Inset: photographs of an (EDBE)PbBr 4 crystal. Reproduced with permission.[qv: 111a] Copyright 2014, American Chemical Society. d) Self‐trapping (A), trapping at permanent defects (B), and self‐trapping influenced by permanent defects (C) represented by a ball interacting with a rubber sheet.

The horizontal dashed line shows possible nonradiative decay processes of the STEs.

Inset: photograph of the colloidal suspension of (OAm) 2SnBr 4 perovskites under UV light. Reproduced with permission. 56 Copyright 2019, American Chemical Society. </caption>
