<p>High-purity stoichiometric Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn intermetallic ingot with a nominal composition of Ti
 <sub>75</sub>Sn
 <sub>25</sub> (atomic percent) was prepared by arc melting in a water-cooled copper crucible using 99.99% (atomic percent) purity starting elements. The ingot was melted eight times repeatedly and then homogenized under vacuum in a furnace at 1223 K for 10 h. There were two kinds of specimens used in our experiments: the bulk Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn samples were taken from the ingot with proper size by electric discharge machining, and the Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn ultrafine powders (with particle size of ~50 Âµm) which were obtained by grinding the bulk material in an agate mortar for 30 min and annealing at 673 K for 20 min under vacuum in a furnace in order to eliminate the residual stress that generated during the milling process.
