<p>The bands broadened with pressure (

As the pressure increased, the band gap decreased, which agrees with the red-shift of the absorption energy (to 564 nm, or 0.08 Ha at ca. 4 GPa) and which is also reflected in the sample’s spectacular color change from light yellow at standard pressure to dark red at 3.5 GPa (
