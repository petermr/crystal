 <p id="Par1">AgInTe
  <sub>2</sub> compound has not received enough recognition in thermoelectrics, possibly due to the fact that the presence of Te vacancy (V
  <sub>Te</sub>) and antisite defect of In at Ag site (In
  <sub>Ag</sub>) degrades its electrical conductivity. In this work, we prepared the Ag
  <sub>1-
   <italic>x</italic>
  </sub>InTe
  <sub>2</sub> compounds with substoichiometric amounts of Ag and observed an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (
  <italic>κ</italic>
  <sub>L</sub> = 0.1 Wm
  <sup>−1</sup>K
  <sup>−1</sup>) for the sample at 
  <italic>x</italic> = 0.15 and 814 K. This leads to more than 2-fold enhancement in the ZT value (ZT = 0.62) compared to the pristine AgInTe
  <sub>2</sub>. In addition, we have traced the origin of the untralow 
  <italic>κ</italic>
  <sub>L</sub> using the Callaway model. The results attained in this work suggest that the engineering of the silver vacancy (V
  <sub>Ag</sub>) concentration is still an effective way to manipulate the thermoelectric performance of AgInTe
  <sub>2</sub>, realized by the increased point defects and modified crystal structure distortion as the V
  <sub>Ag</sub> concentration increases.
