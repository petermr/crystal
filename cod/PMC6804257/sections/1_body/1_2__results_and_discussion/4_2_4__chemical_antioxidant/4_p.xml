<p>Possible interactions between the metal complexes and DPPH radical were studied by Raman spectroscopy in solution. The aromatic C–H in-plane bending band of DPPH radicals observed at 1035 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was shifted to 1018 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the presence of FeL14 complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The same type of shift was observed for the Cu and Mn complexes as well as for the free ligand L14 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figures S12–S14</xref>). As for the effect of DPPH radical on the Fe complex, the M–OH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching band, which appears between 550 and 590 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in solution as well as in solid state, was weakened with the augmentation of the mole ratio of DPPH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f006">Figure 6</xref>), unlike CuL14 and MnL14 complexes (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03556">Figures S13 and S14</xref>. This phenomenon may be related to the fact that only the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> complex was capable of deactivating DPPH free radicals.
