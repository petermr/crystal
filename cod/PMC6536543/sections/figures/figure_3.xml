  <p>Pressure dependence of the unit-cell volume of Ca

   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>7</sub>)(CO

   <sub>2</sub> tilleyite. Solid squares correspond to powder XRD data, and empty blue triangles and green circles correspond to single-crystal XRD data. Fits to all the experimental results for the low- and high-pressure phases are depicted as solid and dashed black lines, respectively. Results from DFT calculations are represented with red lines.
