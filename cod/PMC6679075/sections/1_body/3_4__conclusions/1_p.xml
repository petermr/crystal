<p>By simulating the distribution characteristics of water molecules and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer under different charge characteristics of montmorillonite, the following conclusions were obtained:
 <list list-type="simple">

   <label>(1)</label>
   <p>When the layer charge of the Ca-montmorillonite was mainly derived from the replacement of Si
    <sup>4+</sup> with Al
    <sup>3+</sup> in the tetrahedron, the H
    <sub>w</sub> and the O
    <sub>t</sub> were more easily combined to form a hydrogen bond in the interlayer. Due to the hydrogen bonding force, the water molecules were more compactly arranged, and the diffusion of water molecules among the layers was reduced. Due to the action of electrostatic attraction between the Ca
    <sup>2+</sup> and the Si–O surface, the Ca
    <sup>2+</sup> move to the Si–O surface on both sides and the distribution range was expanded.

   <label>(2)</label>
   <p>With the increase of the charge density in the Ca-montmorillonite layer, the polarity of the Si–O surface was enhanced, and the polar force generated by the water molecules in the interlayers was stronger, the number of hydrogen bonds between the H
    <sub>w</sub> and the O
    <sub>t</sub> increased, and the self-diffusion coefficient of the water molecules decreased. For the Ca
    <sup>2+</sup>, the higher the layer charge density of montmorillonite, the larger the electrostatic force of the Ca
    <sup>2+</sup> subjected to the negative point, and the larger the distribution range of Ca
    <sup>2+</sup>.
