<p>In certain creep theories, dislocation is considered to be one of the important factors influencing creep; thus, the study of dislocation density is warranted. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the various dislocation densities of nanocrystalline NiAl under different simulation conditions, which explains the role of dislocations during creep process.
