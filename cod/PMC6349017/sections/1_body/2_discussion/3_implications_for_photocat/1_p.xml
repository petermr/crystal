<p>The short-range and long-range proton transport properties of a surface are of fundamental importance to, for example, photoelectrochemistry and corrosion. In a recent first-principles simulation-based work, Wood 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="cit42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> investigated short-range proton transfer reactions at the InP(001) and GaP(001) surfaces in contact with water, and provided an excellent discussion about how water diffusion and proton transfer reactivity determine the photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution activity of these materials. In particular, the point on the surface at which a reactant (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, H
 <sup>+</sup> or H) forms need not be the same as the point at which it participates in the hydrogen evolution reaction.
