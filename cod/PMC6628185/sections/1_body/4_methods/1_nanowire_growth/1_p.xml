<p>The zincblende GaP TSLs NWs were grown in an Aixtron Close Coupled Showerhead MOVPE reactor. Prior to growth, we used soft contact lithography to make regular nanoholes pattern in a SiN

 </sub>-coated GaP (111)B wafer. Then the Au-catalyzed GaP TSLs were grown by the vapor–liquid–solid mechanism with a V/III ratio of 21.5 at 640 °C.

 </sup> Phosphine (PH
 <sub>3</sub>) and trimethyl gallium (TMGa) were used as precursors, and hydrogen chloride gas was used to prevent nanowire tapering. The wurtzite (WZ) GaP NWs were grown with the method described in ref (
