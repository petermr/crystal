<p>A classical MD simulation was performed by using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator [

 <xref rid="B52-nanomaterials-09-00978" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] as those for calculations of the PF. Specifically, the time step as set as 0.1 fs, and the velocities of the silicon atoms were assigned according to a time integration on Noseâ€“Hoover equations of motion to keep the system at a given temperature. Then, the internal energies (
