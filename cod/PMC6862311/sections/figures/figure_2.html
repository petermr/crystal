 <caption> Schematic representation of different LC phases. ( a) The nematic phase, in which elongated molecules are preferably aligned along the director n; ( b) The smectic-A phase, in which elongated molecules form parallel layers in addition to the nematic orientational order; ( c) The columnar phase, in which aligned disc-like molecules form 2D lattice of columns. </caption>
