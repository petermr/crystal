<p>A linearly polarized plane wave with a wavelength of 532 nm was incident perpendicularly to the substrate from the top of the particles. A rough mesh covered all the simulated area, while fine meshes (a grid of 1 nm) were set around the center of dimers, as well as at gaps between substrate and nanoparticle. The electric field distribution was recorded as a plane perpendicular to the substrate and containing the centers of the two nanoparticles.</p>
