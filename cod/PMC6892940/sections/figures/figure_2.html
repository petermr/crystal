 <caption> Combined Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern and the neutron diffraction pattern collected at room temperature: The observed (black circle), calculated (red line) and the difference (blue dashed line) diffraction data for ( a, c) x = 0.0, ( b, d) x = 1.0 compositions are shown. Insets of ( a, b) show the magnified view of the peaks around 2 θ ~ 32°, emphasising the monoclinic distortion in case of x = 1.0 sample. </caption>
