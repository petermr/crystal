<p>The heterogeneous photocatalysis is based on the ability of photocatalysts to absorb the light energy required to generate electronâ€“hole pairs for a surface reaction. TiO
 <sub>2</sub> can only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light, but its optical properties can be enhanced by defect engineering. Both oxygen vacancies and hydrogen adsorption give rise to local states below the CB edge, which can extend the light absorption of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> from the UV to the visible ranges. The formation energy is calculated by using the formula:
