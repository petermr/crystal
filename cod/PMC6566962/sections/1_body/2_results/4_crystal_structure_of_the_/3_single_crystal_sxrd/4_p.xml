 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(b</xref>) shows an HAADF-STEM image calculated based on the refined structural model (
 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(a</xref>)) for the Al-31.0 at.%Fe alloy. It reproduces most features in the experimental HAADF-STEM image for the Al-30.0 at.%Fe alloy (
 <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>), except for the difference in M value. Al atoms at the Al31−Al39 sites are hardly visible in either the calculated or experimental images, because of the large atomic displacement of the corresponding sites (

 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(d</xref>). This is very similar to the Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds (Γ-Fe
