 </sup> the band gap decreased by increasing the number of chains from 1.09 eV (single chain) to 0.54 eV (bulk). The band structures of single, double, triple, and septuple SCAC bundles were similar, but they were different from that of the bulk structure. We investigated the effects of vdW interchain interactions by adding the dispersion energy correction to the structural optimization. The dispersion energy decreased the band gaps but did not alter the indirect-to-direct band gap transition trend significantly, whereas the dispersion energy was important in predicting the direct band gap of the double-layer MoS
