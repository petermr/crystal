 </inline-formula>Si alloy series, calculations based on an ab initio band structure, using rigid-band and constant relaxation time approximations (CRTA), were performed in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our calculations for the fourth-period monosilicides are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02710-f012">Figure 12</xref> and agree with the results of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For comparison, we made similar calculations for the TcSi–RuSi–RhSi and ReSi–OsSi series of compounds. These curves qualitatively reproduce experimental dependence of the Seebeck coefficient on the composition: in metallic monosilicides, thermopower is small; in semiconducting ones, it is strongly dependent on doping, including sign change. The increase of Seebeck coefficient amplitude in semiconducting monosilicides is in accordance with the increase of the energy gap while passing from FeSi to RuSi and OsSi. Qualitatively, these dependences fit into the common theory of the Seebeck coefficient.
