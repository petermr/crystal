<p>There is another alternative procedure based on the analysis of the hexagonal structure of the crystal, analyzing how this structure changes at different locations based on the changes of the parameters, a
 <sub>i</sub>, with I = 1, 2, 3. This procedure utilizes the continuum approach but follows the changes of the hexagonal structure in the field. To describe this alternative analysis, we will start with the image of the dislocation shown in
