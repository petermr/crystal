 </xref>a exhibits the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) and the PL excitation (PLE) spectra of the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample. The PLE spectrum recorded at 688 nm emission consisted of two broad excitation bands from 250 to 600 nm, with peaks at 358 and 469 nm. The excitation spectrum could be well-fitted into four Gaussian bands around 354, 390, 448, and 521 nm, which were attributed to the Mn–O charge-transfer band and the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> spin-allowed transitions of 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2g</sub> → 
 <sup>4</sup>T
 <sub>1g</sub>, 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2g</sub> →

 <sub>2g</sub> →

 </sup> Under excitation at 358 nm, the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample exhibited an intense deep-red emission band in the wavelength range of 620–800 nm, with three emission peaks at 662, 674, and 688 nm, which can be assigned to the spin-forbidden 
 <sup>2</sup>E
 <sub>g</sub> → 
 <sup>4</sup>A
 <sub>2g</sub> transition of the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> ions.

 </xref>b shows the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) diagram of BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample were calculated to be (0.7294, 0.2706), which were located in the deep-red region. The corresponding digital photograph of the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample under a 365 nm UV lamp is shown in the inset of
