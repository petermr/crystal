<p id="Par6">We consider several types of O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> sites. The initial positions of the O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> sites in the computations are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which were considered by an empty-space-finder module implemented in the MedeA program
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Among the four types of O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> sites, we focus on two sites, 48
 <italic>g</italic> and 96
 <italic>h</italic>′, which are energetically stable and lead to satisfactory computational convergences. These O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> sites are shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. The other two sites, 16
 <italic>b</italic> and 32
 <italic>e</italic>, are not analyzed in detail in this study, as we considered that they are not energetically preferred. When a neutral (O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>
 <sup>0</sup>) and doubly charged oxygen interstitials (O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>
 <sup>2−</sup>) occupy the 16
 <italic>b</italic> sites, the corresponding 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>form</italic>
 </sub> values are 0.66 and 1.04 eV higher than those of the case where O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> occupy the most stable sites, respectively. The calculations with O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> in the 32
 <italic>e</italic> sites were not well converged, leading to a significantly higher energy and inability to satisfy the optimization condition.
