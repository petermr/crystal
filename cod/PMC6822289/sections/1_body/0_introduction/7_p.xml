<p>In this work, we make a first step toward a systematic approach, which allows for a standardization. The challenge we aim to address is to develop a protocol that not only allows such a standardization (i.e., all materials are optimized identically and using a reproducible protocol) but also allows for systematic improvements and additions. Our approach aims to address on one hand the needs of synthetic chemists with limited knowledge of computational methods, but that would like to use state of the art methods in an automated protocol to standardize the geometry of their just-synthesized crystal. On the other hand we provide a tool to the computational community to collectively improve these optimization protocols.</p>
