 <caption> C-type antiferromagnetic structure of PVO. Pb and V atoms are labeled on the illustration as green (big) and blue (medium) spheres, respectively. Oxygen atoms occur at the corners of the VO 5 square pyramid and are labeled as red (small) spheres. Two types of oxygen atoms are present in PbVO 3, one at apical (labeled as O1) and the other at the planar (labeled as O2) position. The optimized atomic positions are Pb [0, 0, 0], V [0.5, 0.5, 0.5708 (0.5677)], O1 [0, 0, 0.2128 (0.2087)], and O2 [0, 0, 0.6902 (0.6919)]. The values in parentheses are from experimental measurements. 16 </caption>
