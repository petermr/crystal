<p>Significant improvements have been observed by mixing anions or cations. Incorporation of a small amount of bromide (or chloride) influences the phase changes, while the band gap remains unchanged, as already reported for MAPbI
 <sub>2.66</sub>Br
 <sub>0.34</sub> by Weber in 1978.

 </sup> However, chloride components in the precursor solutions tend to be mainly eliminated as HCl vapor (or as CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>Cl) during the annealing step through an intermediate phase, if excess iodide is present (less than 1% chloride in the final phase).
