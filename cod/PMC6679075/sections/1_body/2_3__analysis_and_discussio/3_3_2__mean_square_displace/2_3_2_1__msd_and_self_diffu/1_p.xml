<p>The mean square displacement curves and self-diffusion coefficients of water molecules in the interlayer of the Ca-montmorillonite with different charge characteristics are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02318-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f004">Figure 4</xref>. We can find that the charge position and density of montmorillonite have a certain influence on the diffusibility of water molecules in the interlayer. With the proportion of charge density produced by montmorillonite octahedral substitution increased, the mobility of water molecules in the inter-layer domain was higher and, thus, had a higher diffusion coefficient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, M1). It can be inferred that the self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules was affected by the polarity of the montmorillonite siloxane surface. In other words, if the total charge was fixed, when the charge source was generated in the tetrahedron, due to the short-range spatial effect, the water molecules were subjected to strong polar attraction and difficult to move, so the self-diffusion coefficient was low.
