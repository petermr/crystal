<p>Piezoelectricity is the electricity resulting from pressure. This happens by using crystals to convert mechanical energy to electric energy or vice versa. Its scientific definition is the appearance of an electrical potential (a voltage) across the sides of a crystal when you subject it to mechanical stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When the crystal is deformed by the application of an external stress, electric charges appear on the crystal surfaces; and when the direction of the strain reverses, the polarity of the electric charge is reversed. This is called the direct piezoelectric effect. Inversely, when a piezoelectric crystal is placed in an electric field, or when charges are applied by external means to its faces, the crystal exhibits strain, i.e. the dimensions of the crystal changes. When the direction of the applied electric field is reversed, the direction of the resulting strain is reversed and this is called the inverse piezoelectric effect. [

There are different types of piezoelectric materials, some are naturally found such as Quartz, Rochelle Salt, Topaz, Sucrose, Enamel/ Dentin, Bones and Tourmaline and some are man-made synthetic ones such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3), Gallium Orthophosphate (GaPO
