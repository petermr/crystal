<p id="Par39">In the experiment, we collected 850 reflections, which were merged based upon identical indices to 672 independent reflections with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>int</sub> = 5.08%. At 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.8 Å, completeness of the data was 30.8%. The crystal structure of coesite-IV was used as a starting model for the refinement. The crystal structure was refined against

 <sup>2</sup> on all data by full-matrix least squares with the SHELXL

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> software. The amount of the collected data allowed us to refine the structure only in an isotropic approximation. The resulting ratio between data (672) and the number of parameters (97) was ~7. Five reflections were omitted from the refinement due to overlap with diamond. The final structure was refined to convergence with

 <sub>1</sub> = 8.92%,

 <sub>2</sub> = 20.2%, and GOF = 1.044 for all 672 unique reflections [

 <sub>2</sub> = 18.22%, for those 525 data with
