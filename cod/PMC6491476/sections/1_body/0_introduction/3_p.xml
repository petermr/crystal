<p id="Par4">We have recently developed an approach to solve for undetermined complex crystal structures observed in far-from equilibrium transitions

 </sup>. The approach integrates lattice and space group information from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with a genetic algorithm (GA) structural search. With this approach, we have successfully identified several previously unknown large unit-cell (LUC) structures, including the
