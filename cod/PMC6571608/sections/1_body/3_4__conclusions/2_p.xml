<p>It is shown that the perturbation of the dielectric permittivity in the process of recording of polarization gratings is comparable in magnitude with the perturbation caused by recording phase gratings in this material. It suggests the need to take into account the polarization mechanism during holographic recording by arbitrarily polarized beams.</p>
