<p>For these reasons, this paper proposes a new method to compensate the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors. The theoretical foundation of acceleration-induced effects is analyzed, and an ANSYS simulation of acceleration-induced effects is performed. Then, an acceleration-induced effects dynamic calibration system is built using a Machete hammer and a series of tests for a piezoelectric pressure sensor are carried out. On the basis of this, a mathematical model is obtained in conjunction with measured data by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and system identification theory (SIT). First, the EMD is used to reconstruct the de-noised output of pressure sensors. Second, a suitable mathematical model with optimal parameters is established with SIT. Lastly, a digital compensation filter based on this model is designed to compensate the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors. Through the proposed filter, the acceleration-induced effects can be well filtered out. On one hand, this method does not affect the sensorâ€™s sensitivity and natural frequency. On the other hand, EMD-SIT is more effective than the EMD at reducing the error of the acceleration-induced effects.</p>
