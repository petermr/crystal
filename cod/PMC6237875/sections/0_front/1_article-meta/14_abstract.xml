 <p id="Par2">As silica melts are believed to be important components of the Earthâ€™s mantle, their structure should determine many of its properties. Here, the authors identify two crystalline modifications of SiO
  <sub>2</sub>, whose local structures closely resemble those of known melts, providing a structural model for their atomic ordering at the nanoscale.
