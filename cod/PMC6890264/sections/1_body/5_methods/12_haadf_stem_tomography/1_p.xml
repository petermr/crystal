<p>Tilt series for HAADF-STEM tomography were acquired with a FEI Tecnai Osiris operated at 200 kV in combination with an advanced tomography holder from Fischione Instruments and the FEI XPlore3D acquisition software. Tilt series consisting of 31 HAADF-STEM images were acquired with tilt increments of 5° over a range of ±75°. Alignment of the data was carried out using the FEI Inspect3D software package. The reconstruction was performed using the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique, with 25 iterations, implemented in Inspect3D. Amira (Visage Imaging GmbH) was used for the visualization of the reconstructed volume.</p>
