 </sup> a direct place exchange reaction occurs at the surface of the template NCs, through which the outgoing host cation and the incoming guest cation swap places (

 </sup> This makes balancing the in- and outgoing diffusion rates challenging. An approach to better control aliovalent CE reactions is the use of a single precursor, which both provides the guest cation and extracts the host cation. In the case of the Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for In
 <sup>3+</sup> exchange, a stoichiometric InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–trioctylphosphine complex has been shown to be a suitable precursor, even allowing for topotactic sequential CE (viz., Cd
 <sup>2+</sup> for Cu
 <sup>+</sup>, followed by partial Cu
 <sup>+</sup> for In
 <sup>3+</sup>) in large and complex anisotropic NCs such as CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod nanorods, with preservation of the size, shape, and heterostructure of the template NCs in the product CuInSe
 <sub>2</sub>/CuInS
 <sub>2</sub> dot-in-rod nanorods.

 </sup> The strict control over the CE rates provided by this approach has been recently exploited to fabricate air-stable CuInSe
