<p id="Par13">In the effort to understand the sample-to-sample variation in Néel temperatures, we have conducted first principles theory calculations of the effect of nano-scale strain on the magnetic order, specifically on two questions. The first question is straightforward: is the observed variation in 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> related to the slight difference in planar lattice constants in crystals ‘a’ and ‘b’? We assess based on calculations of the ‘ordering energy,’ specifically the difference in energy between the stripe ground-state and the checkerboard (all neighboring moments are anti-aligned) excited state. The second question, with more complex interpretation, is whether 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis strain is relevant to the observed 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> variation. The motivation for studying this question is the evident ‘shoulder’ in the neutron diffraction results presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, which could result from 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis nano-scale strain, and thereby an effective 
 <italic>distribution</italic> of local 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice parameters. Note that the bulk lattice constants for crystals ‘a’ and ‘b’ are identical (to within 0.001 Å), so that we are studying, in effect, the local nanoscale energetics rather than constructing an involved model of the bulk Néel point variation for a sample with a distribution of local lattice constants.
