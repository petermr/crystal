 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the ISAR imaging results before signal calibration. Due to the influences of wideband signal nonlinearity, the main lobes in range of the corner reflectors are broadened severely, and harmonic waves, which nearly cannot be distinguished from the real target, emerge. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the ISAR imaging results after signal calibration. The calibration data are radar echoes of a static corner reflector located at the center of the turntable. The signal calibration is achieved by Equation (17) with the radar echoes of the imaging target and reference target. The compensated ISAR images of the two corner reflectors focus well, and the harmonic waves are eliminated. All the ISAR images are displayed in log-magnitude and the dynamic range is 20 dB. The InISAR imaging results before and after signal calibration are shown as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The real coordinates and interferometric coordinates in x-axis and z-axis of the two corner reflectors are given in 
 <xref rid="sensors-19-02330-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The real x coordinates can be obtained from the ISAR images in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f006">Figure 6</xref>, and the real z coordinates are measured based on the geometric relationship between reference target and imaging target. Compared to the real coordinates, both the x coordinates and z coordinates of the two corner reflectors have a large offset before signal calibration, and the x coordinate of the first corner reflector even encounters phase wrapping. After phase inconsistency compensation, the coordinates in the InISAR imaging result are very close to the real coordinates of target. The above experimental results have fully validated our signal calibration method to compensate the frequency nonlinearity and phase inconsistency. All the experimental results of this paper are obtained on a desktop computer with Intel core i7-7820X 3.60 GHz CPU and 32 GB RAM using Matlab codes. The algorithm reconstruction time, which excludes data import time, of this InISAR imaging experiment is 0.622 s.
