 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(C)</xref> shows the plotting of η
 <sub>T</sub> versus Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion concentration. As it shown, the energy transfer efficiency increases in pace with Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion concentration increasing, and When Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion concentration is 0.32, the efficiency can reach to 74.72%. and it can be estimated that the critical concentration when energy transfer efficiency is 50%, approximately equals 0.336.
