 <caption> Crystal structure, band structure, and metal-insulator transition of LMO. ( A) Projection of four unit cells onto the ac plane, where the MoO 6 octahedra hosting the conducting zigzag chains (oriented out of this plane along the b axis) are highlighted in purple. Blue sphere, Mo; red/pink, O; green, Li. ( B) In each unit cell, there are double zigzag chains made of corner-sharing octahedra. The octahedra at the top of the figure have had all nonessential oxygen atoms removed. The corner oxygen shared by adjacent in-chain octahedra is denoted in red, while interchain oxygen is denoted in pink. ( C) Simplified Fermi surface of LMO showing the weakly dispersive, quasi-1D bands along the a axis due to the weak interchain hopping energy (top panel), which, nevertheless, causes an energy gap around the Fermi surface (schematic green curves in the lower panel). The small energy gap easily allows excitation of electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons. ( D) In-chain resistivity versus temperature showing a metal-insulator transition around T min ~ 25 K, below which the insulating form of the resistivity can be well fitted by a power law (see section S4C and fig. S11). Crystallographic drawings were produced using VESTA ( 44 ). </caption>
