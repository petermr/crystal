 <sub>3</sub> QDs (AIPQD−CLC laser) with highly spectral tunability and long-term stability was demonstrated. The CsSnI
 <sub>3</sub> QDs were obtained through a low-cost solvothermal pretreatment process with PL peak at 594 nm with FWHM of 35 nm. Under the optical pump with energy of 0.15 μJ/pulse, FWHM of PL peak decreased down to 0.20 nm with significant PL intensity increase (

It was shown that the laser based on lead-free perovskite QDs possessed high stability during storage in ambient (room temperature and humidity of 60%) and retained ~87% of its initial lasing efficiency after half a year. One of the interesting findings is that the lasing wavelength can be tuned by various approaches: Modification of the ratio of the chiral dopant in liquid crystal, changing the temperature, or applying different alternating current (AC) voltages to the active media in the laser (
