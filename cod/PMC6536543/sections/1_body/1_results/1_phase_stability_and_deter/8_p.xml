<p id="Par13">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> it can be seen the general upshift of the bands of tilleyite with increasing pressure (see also Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> of SI). No significant broadening is observed as expected by the crystallinity of the solid and the hydrostaticity provided by the pressure transmitting medium. In the low frequency region there are changes in the relative intensities of the modes that could be explained by the continuous change towards a higher coordination number of the Ca atoms induced by pressure, as revealed in XRD experiments.
