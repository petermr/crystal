<p id="Par24">We have shown that a stabile BiI
 <sub>3</sub> monosheet can be grown on the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub>(0001) surface. The geometric structure of the BiI
 <sub>3</sub> film -although basically reminiscent of the bulk- is characterized by strong relaxations along the vertical direction. Similarly, the electronic structure of the film and the Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub> surface are significantly modified. The TSS of the pristine Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub>(0001) surface is instable against BiI
 <sub>3</sub> adsorption and a new non-dispersing interface state appears in the direct band gap (1.2â€‰eV) of BiI
 <sub>3</sub>.
