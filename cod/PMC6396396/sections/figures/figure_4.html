 <caption> Vacancy distribution patterns of selected mullite supercells. The oxygen coordination spheres of vacancies are shown in green. In views along b tetrahedra are neglected for clarity and octahedral chains are shown with decreased opacity. Views parallel to c show slabs of the models of M25 (bottom left) and M50 (bottom right). AlO 6 octahedra are shown in dark blue. Each tetrahedral site is a potential site for Si, but in this figure Al and Si are not distinguished. </caption>
