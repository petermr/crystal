<p>Accordingly, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the length of the Ge–Se–II bond nearly perpendicular to the layer plane decreases linearly with pressure. The Ge–Se–III nonbonding distance in the layer plane decreases rapidly with the increase of the pressure and it reaches the same value as the Ge–Se–I bond (2.59 Å) at 34 GPa. When the pressure increases up to 34 GPa, the decrease rate of bond III is essentially linear with the equal value of bond II. The distance of the Ge–Ge nearly perpendicular to the layer plane decreases sharply with the increase of the pressure, similarly to the Ge–Se–III bond. Consequently, the symmetry of the GeSe structure becomes higher when the hydrostatic pressure approaches 34 GPa. To show the effect of the hydrostatic pressure on the bond distance more clearly, the relationship between the reduced bond distance and the pressure is plotted in the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It is obvious that the nonbonding distances of the intralayer Ge–Se and the interlayer Ge–Ge are shortened more quickly than the other bond lengths with the increasing pressure. When the pressure reaches 34 GPa, both the bond length of Ge–Se–III and the distance of Ge–Ge decrease approximately linearly with the increase of pressure. Moreover, we further analyzed the evolution of the bond angles θ
 <sub>1</sub> (Se–Ge–Se), θ
 <sub>2</sub> (Ge–Se–Ge), and θ
 <sub>3</sub> (Se–Ge–Se) as marked in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f001">Figure 1</xref>b with the pressure application. The bond angles θ
 <sub>1</sub> and θ
 <sub>2</sub> decrease slowly and monotonically with the pressure. In contrast, the bond angle θ
 <sub>3</sub> become larger gradually with the increase of pressure. The bond angles θ
 <sub>1</sub>, θ
 <sub>2</sub>, and θ
 <sub>3</sub> at zero pressure are 92.41°, 102.63°, and 76.76°, respectively. When the pressure reaches 37 GPa, the bond angles of θ
 <sub>1</sub> and θ
 <sub>2</sub> decrease to 83.69° and 96.30°, whereas the angle of θ
 <sub>3</sub> increases up to 83.69°. These findings suggest that the zigzag Ge–Se chain along the c axis gradually disappears with the increasing pressure. The mechanism of compression of GeSe under pressure is mainly due to the narrowing of the Ge–Se distance in the layer plane and the interlayer Ge–Ge separation. The evolution of the 4c Wyckoff positions at (x, 1/4, z) of the Ge and Se atom are illustrated in
