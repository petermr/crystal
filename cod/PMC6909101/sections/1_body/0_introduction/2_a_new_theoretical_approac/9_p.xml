<p id="p0045">The linearity and sufficient length of the basic optical chromophores of polymethine dyes and their aggregates, associated with the linearity and a sufficiently large length of their polymethine chain, lead to the fact that we can neglect the interaction of the electronic transition with the motion of the nuclei of the dyes themselves and take into account only its interaction with environmental nuclei [
