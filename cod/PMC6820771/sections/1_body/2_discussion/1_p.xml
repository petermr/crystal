<p id="Par21">In this work, we have developed a nanocrystalline variant of 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> which maintains the metallic character associated with the 1T′-phase. By altering the morphology from crystalline to nanocrystalline, the material exhibits a dramatic enhancement in its electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media. Using a range of analytical and characterisation techniques, we have shown that the origin of this enhanced electrochemical activity is not structural or morphological in origin. Instead, computational analysis suggests that electron doping under an applied reductive bias, and associated adsorption of hydrogen on certain Te sites in the material drives a distortion of the MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> structure which gives a more active catalyst as long as H remains adsorbed to the surface. This provides an explanation for the gradual improvement of catalytic activity over time (or with continued reductive cycling), as a gradual increase in the level of electron doping on the metallic surface leads to a gradual increase in hydrogen surface coverage until a limiting level of electron doping is reached at a given potential. It is significant that this enhancement effect occurs not at the relatively scarce edge-sites, but on the basal plane of the material. Hence, by activating the basal plane, the electrocatalytic performance of the bulk material can be vastly improved, providing an efficient route for optimising the HER activity of MoTe
 <sub>2</sub>, and possibly other TMDCs as well.
