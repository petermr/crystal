 </xref> displays the NOA signals observed upon 794 nm excitation of Med-6019 PDs loaded with PETACrONO and with the Nd-UCNPs. NO release that increases with increasing laser power is readily apparent. The averaged integrated NOA signals demonstrate the release of 26.4, 56.6, 88.7, and 110.3 pmol of NO for excitations at 300, 567, 833, and 1100 mW, respectively. No nitric oxide was released upon 794 nm irradiation of a PD loaded only with PETACrONO; so, this behavior can readily be attributed to the presence of the Nd-UCNPs. The NO release proved to be almost linear with the laser power employed, and this proved somewhat unexpected given the nonlinear behavior seen for aqueous solutions containing the photoNORM RBS (Na[Fe
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub>(NO)
 <sub>7</sub>]) and silica-coated NaYF
 <sub>4</sub>:Yb/Er@NaYF
 <sub>4</sub> core/shell UCNPs that are activated with 980 nm excitation.

 </sup> However, as noted above, direct excitation at 451 nm did not respond linearly to irradiation time, and this was attributed to enhanced back-reactions when more NO was generated in a single event. Thus, two counteracting trends may be at play in the present case.
