<p>To set up the simulation system, the following steps were performed: (1) based on the saturated concentration (see below), a certain number of water molecule and the corresponding number of anions and cations were chosen. The ions were randomly distributed into water to form a solution. (2) At 298 K and 1 bar, the solution was equilibrated through long-time molecular dynamics simulation. (3) The solution and a NaCl crystal are combined to build the interface system. Then, an extensive simulation with the NPT ensemble was performed for 5 ns to equilibrate the system, in which the pressure was set as 1 bar with the damping coefficient being 1000 time steps. Finally, a further 25 ns simulation at 298 K with NVT ensemble was used to calculate the physical properties.</p>
