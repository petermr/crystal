 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> presents the measured 
 <italic>L–I–V</italic> characteristics for the three kinds of mini-CSPLED. At an injection current of 20 mA, the forward voltages of the 120° mini-CSPLED, 150° mini-CSPLED, and 180° mini-CSPLED were all the same and ∼ 2.72 V. Further increasing the injection current to 200 mA, the forward voltages of these three types mini-CSPLED were all increased to 3.09–3.14 V. It is clear that the 
 <italic>I–V</italic> curves of these three devices are almost identical, demonstrating that the CSP process does not damage the electrical properties. On the other hand, the 
 <italic>L–I</italic> curve shows only a slight difference in the light output power of the 120° mini-CSPLED, 150° mini-CSPLED, and 180° mini-CSPLED, which indicates the result of successful device optimization via the CSP structure. On the other hand, the light output power of the three kinds of mini-CSPLEDs initially increases linearly with the injection current. The 
 <italic>L–I</italic> curve shows only a slight difference in the light output power of the 120° mini-CSPLED, 150° mini-CSPLED, and 180° mini-CSPLED, which indicates the result of successful device optimization via the CSP structure. As the injection current increased up to 200 mA, the light output power of the three kinds of mini-CSPLEDs were approximately 250.9, 258.0, and 245.9 mW. The light output power of the 120° mini-CSPLED exhibits lower than 150° mini-CSPLED, which may be absorbed by the diffusion reflective layer. The 180° mini-CSPLED gives 2.05% and 4.93% deterioration in the light output power at a high current of 200 mA as compared to the 120° mini-CSPLED and 150° mini-CSPLED. The deterioration could be attributed to the addition of a diffusion reflective layer on top of the transparent layer/CSPLED, the light may be slightly absorbed, or most of the light is concentrated in the transparent layer, with the reflection emitted from the sidewall.
