<p id="Par17">However, even in the multiple stage emplacement scenario, we could expect gradational contacts between the peridotite and the pyroxenite since they are almost coeval. Also between the pyroxenite and the gabbro a gradational contact can be expected because of the blanketing process in which the gabbro above the pyroxenite unit reheated its topmost part (up to 500–600 °C) without re-opening the Fe-Mg system in the augites that would require much higher T (
