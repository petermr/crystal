<p>We employed a method where we assign a “proton hole center”, PHC, to be located at each “free” O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> (surface O without any bound H), as well as at either the Zn or O position of O*H
 <sup>–</sup>. This assignment is useful because the number of surface atoms does not change during the simulation, whereas the number of water molecules adsorbed on the surface, which are the sources of the protons, fluctuates during the simulation as a result of exchange events with the liquid water film. Thus, in our two surface ZnO models of the ZnO(101[combining macron]0) and ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surfaces, there are 48 Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> and 48 O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> surface ions per side of the slab, and thus there is a total of 48 PHCs per side of the slab.
