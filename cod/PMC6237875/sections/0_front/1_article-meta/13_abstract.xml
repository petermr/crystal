 <p id="Par1">Modelling of processes involving deep Earth liquids requires information on their structures and compression mechanisms. However, knowledge of the local structures of silicates and silica (SiO
  <sub>2</sub>) melts at deep mantle conditions and of their densification mechanisms is still limited. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of metastable high-pressure silica phases, coesite-IV and coesite-V, using in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction and ab initio simulations. Their crystal structures are drastically different from any previously considered models, but explain well features of pair-distribution functions of highly densified silica glass and molten basalt at high pressure. Built of four, five-, and six-coordinated silicon, coesite-IV and coesite-V contain SiO
  <sub>6</sub> octahedra, which, at odds with 3
  <sup>rd</sup> Pauling’s rule, are connected through common faces. Our results suggest that possible silicate liquids in Earth’s lower mantle may have complex structures making them more compressible than previously supposed.
