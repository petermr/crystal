<p id="Par5">The Vickers microhardness distribution over the vertical cross-section demonstrates a reasonably homogeneous hardness distribution within the material, thus confirming the microstructural homogeneity after HPT for 100 turns on the Al-Mg alloy. In practice, an average hardness of

 </sub> ≈ 340 and a maximum hardness of ~370 were recorded within the disk. Comparing the general saturated hardness ranges of ~65 for a commercial purity aluminum Al-1050 and ~105 for the magnesium ZK60 alloy after HPT, the processing through 100 turns introduced an extreme hardness of the mechanically-bonded Al-Mg alloy. The results provide the first demonstration of a homogeneous microstructure and hardness distributions within a disk material produced by mechanical bonding through HPT. Thus, the microstructural homogeneity contrasts with earlier reports for the Al-Mg
