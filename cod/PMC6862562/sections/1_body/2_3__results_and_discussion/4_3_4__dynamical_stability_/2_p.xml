<p>It is well known that the characteristics of phonon spectra are determined by both the chemical bond strength and the mass of the unit structure. It can be clearly seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03612-f007">Figure 7</xref>a that there is an obvious gap in the phonon spectra of GeSe in the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> structure, from 118 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 142 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The gap gradually decreases with the application of hydrostatic pressure. The minimum point of high-frequency optical phonons exists at Γ, which decreases with pressure. Additionally, the phonon spectra of GeSe in the 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> structure are practically merged. The frequencies of the acoustic vibrational modes along the Γ-Z direction increase, mixing with optical phonons, which is due to the enhancement of interlayer interaction. The vibrational branches of the 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> structure have significant dispersion, whereas the branches of the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> structure are almost flat. It is interesting to note that the highest phonon spectrum frequency (275.9 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the 
 <italic>Cmcm</italic> structure is higher than that of the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> structure (220.6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The increase of the Ge–Se bond strength and the shortening of the bond length are responsible for this phenomenon.
