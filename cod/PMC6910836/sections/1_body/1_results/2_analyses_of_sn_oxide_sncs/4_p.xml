<p>The goal of the present work was to explore the nature of SNCs by assessing the structural and chemical properties of Sn oxide SNCs in detail. Note that the intense 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1g</sub> peak generated by bulk SnO
 <sub>2</sub> disappears completely in the spectra produced by SNCs (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, the emergence of a broad signal is typically indicative of the accumulation of signals from Snâ”€O bonds with slightly different binding configurations. Thus, the loss of the 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1g</sub> peak and the appearance of the broad signal suggest the complete deformation of the crystalline structure of rutile type Sn oxide in the SNCs, along with the formation of multiatom clusters with distorted atomic configurations.
