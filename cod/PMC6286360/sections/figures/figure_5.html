 <caption> Characterization and photographs of the LEDs. a CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram and the positions (marked by the dots) for blue LED (0.15, 0.03; a 3D-TPE-COF (0.38, 0.57; b (λ ex = 450 nm), and COF-coated LED (0.30, 0.35; ( c). b Normalized luminescence intensity vs. time curve of the 3D-TPE-COF-coated WLED driven at 2 mA. Photographs of the LEDs: c a reference blue LED (not turned on), d the reference blue LED turned on (emission with blue light), e the same LED coated with a thin layer of 3D-TPE-COF (not turned on), and f the coated LED turned on (emission with white light) </caption>
