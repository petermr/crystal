<p id="Par21">Vickers hardness measurements were also performed on the 20 mm × 20 mm × 1 mm plate coupons (see Methods). Like the color coordinates, the hardness of the MGMCs is also found to vary with 
 <italic>x</italic> in a manner consistent with the rule of mixtures. Specifically, the MGMCs with 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.35, 0.5, and 0.65 display Vickers hardness values of 220 HV, 250 HV, and 295 HV, which increase fairly linearly from the value of the primary-Au of 120 HV to that of the metallic glass of 350 HV (see Methods and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, Supplemental Information). The hardness values of the as-quenched MGMCs represent 85%, 125%, and 145% improvements over that of the as-quenched primary Au
 <sub>65.2</sub>Cu
 <sub>22.4</sub>Ag
 <sub>12.4</sub>. These improvements far exceed those achievable by conventional heat treatment (e.g. age hardening) of primary-Au alloys, which typically do not exceed 50% (ref.

 </sup>). Hence, the present MGMC concept of controlling color is also a very effective approach to promote hardness.
