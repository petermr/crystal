<p>Since the amplification of the stimulated emission imposes high demands on the active medium, lead-free perovskites are still not widely implemented in lasing systems. In 2016, Guichuan Xing et al. published their work [
 <xref rid="B126-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] on NIR lasing from tin-based perovskite. They showed that tin-based halide perovskites (CsSnX
 <sub>3</sub>, X = Br, I) surprisingly possess exceptional optical gain properties in the near-infrared region up to ≈1 μm, which cannot be achieved with lead-based perovskites. NIR lasing with Q ≈ 500 is achieved using the natural photonic crystal at ultralow-threshold (≈6 μJ cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) from 20% SnF
 <sub>2</sub>-added to CsSnI
 <sub>3</sub> samples, which are comparable to their lead-based counterparts (
