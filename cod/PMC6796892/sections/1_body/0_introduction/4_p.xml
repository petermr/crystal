 </sup> have examined the cubic phase of PVO under high pressure on experimental and theoretical bases. They determined the transition pressure to be 3 GPa and showed that above this pressure, the semiconductor-to-metal transition associated with the structural transition (tetragonal to cubic) occurs.
