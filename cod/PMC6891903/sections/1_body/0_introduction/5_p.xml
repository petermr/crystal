<p>Considering the stress responsivity of TIEL is nearly three orders higher than ML in the low‐stress region,
 <xref rid="advs1381-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> the wind‐driven TIEL in elastic ZnS:Cu+PDMS should display a significantly improved luminescent property than ML. In addition, wind‐driven TIEL can be integrated with a PD to generate real‐time electrical signals for wind speed detection with an enhanced output current than TENG‐based sensor. Therefore, the proposed hybrid wind speed sensor would not only present a lower detection limit but also present significantly higher output current.
