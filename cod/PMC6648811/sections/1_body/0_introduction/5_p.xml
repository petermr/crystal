 </sup> The advantage of Nd-UCNPs is that these can be excited with a continuous NIR diode laser operating at ∼800 nm

 </sup> and the resulting upconverted visible light is reabsorbed by the photoNORM to uncage NO. Excitation at ∼800 nm allows one to avoid the modest absorbance by water at 980 nm, thereby improving NIR transmission depth and reducing potential tissue damage due to heating effects. During the course of the experiments described here, Ostrowski and co-workers
