<p>For a sample of poor statistics or high in-plane order, an experiment using a 360° azimuthal rotation is best. For some samples, it might be sufficient to collect all information obtained during the rotation within a single image. However, if several images at distinct azimuths are recorded, 
 <italic>GIDVis</italic> allows the user to combine the full diffraction information in one image afterwards by summing, averaging and extracting the maximum intensity of each pixel during the rotation. This provides a convenient way of reducing the data for an initial texture and polymorph phase analysis. Additionally, pole figures can easily be calculated, which takes full advantage of collecting data for the entire upper hemisphere [Fig. 4
