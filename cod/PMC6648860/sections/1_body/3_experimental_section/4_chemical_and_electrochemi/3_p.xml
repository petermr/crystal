<p>Electrochemical oxidation tests were carried out in three-electrode Swagelok cells, by using metal discs (Li, Mg, or Ca) as counter and reference electrode and the active phase as working electrode either as a powder mixture (85:15% w/w) with Super P carbon or as tape (with 80% wt of active material, 10% wt of Super P carbon and 10% wt of polyvinylidene fluoride binder). Al and stainless steel current collectors were used for the working and reference/counter electrodes, respectively, and Whatman glass fiber discs soaked in 0.6 mL of electrolyte solution were used as separators.</p>
