 <caption> We show the drag coefficient B ( β T ) from phonon wind for dislocations in Ni of various character angles ϑ . The dashed lines represent the three-parameter fitting functions with fitting parameters C i in units of μ Pas, critical velocity β t crit = v c / c T , and β T = v / c T . The solid lines show the results of numerically evaluating B according to Equation ( 1) using the software in Ref. [ 24], see Ref. [ 13] for details on the method. </caption>
