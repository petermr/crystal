<p id="Par16">The late stage-emplacement of the gabbro-pyroxenite unit allows the pyroxenite beneath to cool down sufficiently fast in agreement with our closure temperature (791 °C) estimate without invoking any reset of the Fe-Mg ordering degree (i.e. no chemical re-opening of the system) as we would have considered for the hypothesis of a single stage emplacement differentiated 
 <italic>in-situ</italic>. The latter hypothesis can be excluded even more considering the low viscosity of the pyroxenite measured by Vetere 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> on the same composition, also explain the high (120 m) thickness for these lavas on Earth (e.g. Ontario lava flows). The only contrasting evidence that poses against the multistage event could be the absence of the hyaloclastite at the top of each layer and the gradational contacts between the subsequent lithologic unit.
