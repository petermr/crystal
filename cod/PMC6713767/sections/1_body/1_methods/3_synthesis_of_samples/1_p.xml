 <sup>2+</sup>-actived zeolite-3A samples were prepared by using a typical high-temperature solid-state reaction method. Firstly, different stoichiometric amounts of zeolite-3A and Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> were mixed well and thoroughly ground in an agate mortar for 40â€‰min. And then, they were sintered at different temperature without reducing atmosphere. Finally, the target samples were gained after cooling.
