 <caption> Schematic representation of the working and output characterstics of a p-type OFET: ( a) Negative V DS regime and ( b) positive V DS regime. In negative V DS regime, two regions exist within the channel; accumulation region and depletion region. However, in positive V DS regime, there is no depletion region rather only accumulation region exists for the whole channel. ( c, d) Show the room temperature output characteristics ( I DS  −  V DS ) of pentacene thin film based OFET in negative and positive V DS regime, respectively. Mechanisms of charge transport in negative and positive V DS regime seem different. </caption>
