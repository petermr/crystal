<p>Alanates are frequently synthesized by the reaction of metals or metallic hydrides (e.g., NaH) with Al, H
 <sub>2</sub>, and a catalyst in organic solvents, such as toluene, hexane, n-octane, ether, diglyme, ether, or tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Equations (1)–(4)) [

 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Frequently, a Ti-compound is used as a catalyst. Typically, an excess of Al is used. This method needs the use of moderate to high hydrogen pressure (100–150 bar) and moderate temperatures (120–150 °C); except for LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>, which requires a higher pressure (350 bar) [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This method can be considered to be highly dangerous due to the explosive mixture of organic solvents, metal hydride, and Al with oxygen and humidity. The materials thus produced require further steps of purification and drying. Frequently, the alanates are kept and sold in THF solution.
