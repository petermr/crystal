 </sup>. Thus, a thorough understanding of the nature of reactions, e.g., catalysis and corrosion, entails an understanding of the elementary dynamical processes involved, in which mass, charge, and energy transport play important roles. Needless to say, this requires knowledge of the (local) atomic configurations. From this we could discern the corresponding electron distribution and local reactivity.
