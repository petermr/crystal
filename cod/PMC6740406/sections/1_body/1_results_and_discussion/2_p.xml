 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> particles before and after annealing. Both samples exhibited a cylindrical shape before annealing, but the particles by reaction in RPB reactors showed a more regular shape and smaller size. The aspect ratio of the particles in the field of view is uniform and the surface is smooth. After annealing of the precursor, the samples obtained from RPB routes maintained their original particle sizes (about 2 Î¼m) without significant agglomeration. The organic component disappears and the structure of cylinder changes. However, the samples prepared by the conversional STR route exhibited relative wide size distributions. The typical elemental mapping results, the merged images of Gd mapping and Eu mapping in particularly, indicated that the doping of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions in the GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> matrix was more uniformly dispersed in the samples of RPB (

 </xref>a,c) than that in the samples of STR (
