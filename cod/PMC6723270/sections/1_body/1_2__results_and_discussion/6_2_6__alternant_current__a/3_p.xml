<p>It is probable that the stacking faults in Mn4 provide crystallographic active sites for the movement of the charge carrier, as was evidenced in the surface energy plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f004">Figure 4</xref>c,d). Hence, it is probable that, at low frequencies, the ionic conduction process is the most favorable for Mn4, as represented by the appearance of the straight line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. Also, in this material, the K–O bond distances, the crystallographic position of K
 <sup>+</sup>, and the H
 <sub>2</sub>O interlayer allows the continuity in the channels for ionic conduction. Differences in the amount of potassium and water, and its position in the crystal cell of the studied materials, influence the electrical behavior in the low-frequency region. At higher contents of K
 <sup>+</sup> ions, the two positions in the crystal cell, for the water molecules in Mn8, and the proper alignment of the material´s layers limit the ionic conduction routes, such that this contributes to a diminished ionic conductivity at low frequency (

 <xref rid="B52-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; therefore, the ions in the interlayer space are mobile. Water is an important key for the mobility of the ions in the interlayer space [

 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A low amount of water in the interlayer region can diminish the ionic mobility of the ions [
 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, the water´s ability to facilitate ion conduction is dependent on the charge density of these ion [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-09-01156" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Another reason for the enhanced conductivity is that the stacking faults alter the electrical conduction pathways. It is probable that this heterogeneous surface creates interactions between the electric field and the charge carrier. The variations in surface energies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01156-f004">Figure 4</xref>c,d) support the heterogeneity of the material surfaces.
