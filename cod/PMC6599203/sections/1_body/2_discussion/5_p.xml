<p id="Par34">In conclusion, we have realised that the strong polarisation dependence of Raman scattering by 
 <italic>E</italic> or 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> symmetry modes in cubic materials could be used to determine crystallographic orientation of an arbitrarily oriented crystal facet. We have derived and tested approximate analytic expressions that allow of determining both the crystallographic orientation of the surface normal as well as the crystallographic orientation of a selected direction in the crystal surface. The method can be applied to any cubic material with 
 <italic>E</italic> or 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> symmetry Raman modes. Comparison of Raman scattering and EBSD techniques applied to the same grains on a selected surface of GVS ceramics indicates that the method is functional and reasonably precise. The method can be very useful when a polycrystalline sample is used to determine anisotropic properties. In particular, we believe that this fully optical method can have advantage as a relatively cheap alternative to EBSD or in a limited experimental environment, for example when in-situ EBSD is not available but optical microscopy can be arranged.
