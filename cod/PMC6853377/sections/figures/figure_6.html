 <caption> Quantitative analysis of the measured valence-band patterns of Fig. 5 ▸. ( a) k-space scheme of direct transitions from the valence-band of Re to free-electron-like final states in the energy range used. The periodic background pattern is a measured Fermi-surface cut in this plane; the pattern is to scale with k z and k y quantified in multiples of the reciprocal lattice vectors G 0001 and for Re. The dotted rectangle in the lower inset marks the first BZ. The three transitions shown lead to final-state energy isospheres crossing the 18th, 23rd and 28th repeated BZ along k z . k hν is the photon momentum which lies in the drawing plane and leads to a displacement of the centers of the final-state spheres (shown in detail in the lower inset). ( b) Brillouin zone with high-symmetry points and direction of photon impact. ( c) Measured Fermi surface in different perspectives. The central panel denotes the cut leading to the background pattern in ( a). Movies showing the measured momentum pattern at 3.830 keV as a function of binding energy, a k z -scan across the spectral density and a perspective view of the Fermi surface are shown in the supporting information. </caption>
