<p>In the hope of gaining more insight into the formation of both isomers of 
 <bold>1</bold>, the reaction of [K([18]crown‐6)][Cp*Fe(C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)] with 
 <bold>L</bold> was monitored by 
 <sup>31</sup>P{
 <sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectroscopy at 273 K. The initial spectrum showed immediate, full consumption of ligand 
 <bold>L</bold>, and formation of two major new groups of resonances at ca. −25 and −42 ppm.
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Only after approximately 30 minutes did signals attributable to 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold> and 
 <bold>1‐π</bold> become readily discernible, growing in steadily over the course of several hours with concomitant loss of the intermediate resonances.
