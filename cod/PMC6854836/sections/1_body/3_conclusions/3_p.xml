<p>α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> is metastable with respect to β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> and Si, and its formation is kinetically driven. Polycrystalline bulk samples can be obtained within hours when heating binary reaction mixtures at temperatures 1200–1300 °C. Thermodynamcially stable β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> forms when dwelling binary reaction mixtures at temperatures 1175–1200 °C for extended periods of time (days to weeks). The slow kinetics of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> formation can be overcome by the application of high pressure (5–8 GPa). The fast kinetics of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> formation can exploited for simultaneous synthesis and consolidation of specimens using spark plasma sintering. Both α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> convert into SiB
 <sub>6</sub> and Si at temperatures above 1250 °C.
