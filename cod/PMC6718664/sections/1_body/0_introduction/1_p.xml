<p id="Par3">Layered-structured oxides have been regarded as the conventional cathode materials in rechargeable batteries due to their advantageous properties and good electrochemical performances. Generally, layered-structure oxides tend to transform into a defective spinel-like structure during alkali ion extraction, a process which seems especially severe for manganese-based layered materials. This phase transformation from layered to spinel structure is induced by the rearrangement of transition metal ions and alkali ions

 </sup>. This transformation is normally considered irreversible and therefore should be prevented. Indeed, most of the research undertaken to date have focused solely on suppressing this irreversible phase transformation (e.g. by partial substitution of manganese with other transition metals), while there was little success in making this structural transformation highly reversible
