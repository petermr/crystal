 <caption> Effect of electronic excitation, temperature and B-site composition. Evolution of the radial distribution function (g(r)) of cubic LZO as function of ( a) the electronic excitation concentration at 300â€‰K and ( b) the temperature for a fixed 0.8% of excitation concentration. ( c) Evolution of crystalline-to-amorphous transition temperature in cubic T-LZO compounds as function of the excitation concentration for 50%, 75% and 100% Zr fraction. </caption>
