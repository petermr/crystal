<p>RbAlH
 <sub>4</sub> decomposes in two steps at 300 °C and 350 °C (peak temperatures in TG-DCS curves) [
 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. However, no complete dehydrogenation and full reversibility have been demonstrated. There is no consensus regarding the dehydrogenation pathway. Weidenthaler et al. proposed that the two dehydrogenation events are related to the formation of RbH plus Al, and the decomposition of RbH, respectively [
 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. For its part, Dymova el at. proposed a first decomposition that is associated with the formation of Rb
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub> at 317–334 °C and a second dehydrogenation step by the formation of RbH at 390–417 °C [
 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>,
 <xref rid="B179-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Further confirmation of the dehydrogenation pathway and the formation of Rb
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>6</sub> is needed.
