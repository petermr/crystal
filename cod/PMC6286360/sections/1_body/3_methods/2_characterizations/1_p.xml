<p id="Par14">High-resolution mass spectra were collected on DIONEX UltiMate 3000 &amp; Bruker Compact TOF and Bruker Solarix mass spectrometers. Solid-state NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature on a Bruker AVANCE III 400M spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iN10 micro FTIR Spectrometer. Elemental analysis was conducted on a Flash EA 1112. The PXRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with Cu K
 <italic>α</italic> line (λ = 1.54056 Å). Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TGA-Q500 from 30 to 800 °C at the rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> without equilibration delay. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were performed on a Zeiss ∑IGMA operating at an accelerating voltage ranging from 0.1 to 20 kV. The samples were prepared by dispersing the material onto conductive adhesive tapes attached to a flat aluminum sample holder and then coated with gold. Nitrogen isotherms were measured at 77 K using an Autosorb-iQ (Quantachrome) surface area size analyzer.
