<p id="Par13">Rapidly quenched rod samples and plate coupons of various alloys that follow the tie-line composition formula of Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) were prepared (see Methods). The alloys include a primary-Au phase alloy with composition Au
 <sub>65.2</sub>Cu
 <sub>22.4</sub>Ag
 <sub>12.4</sub>, three MGMC alloys with compositions Au
 <sub>60</sub>Cu
 <sub>23.5</sub>Ag
 <sub>9.1</sub>Pd
 <sub>1</sub>Si
 <sub>6.4</sub>, Au
 <sub>58</sub>Cu
 <sub>24</sub>Ag
 <sub>7.5</sub>Pd
 <sub>1.5</sub>Si
 <sub>9</sub>, and Au
 <sub>55.5</sub>Cu
 <sub>24.4</sub>Ag
 <sub>6.2</sub>Pd
 <sub>2</sub>Si
 <sub>11.9</sub>, and a metallic glass phase alloy with composition Au
 <sub>50</sub>Cu
 <sub>25.5</sub>Ag
 <sub>3</sub>Pd
 <sub>3</sub>Si
 <sub>18.5</sub>. The molar fractions of the metallic glass phase in the alloys, 
 <italic>x</italic>, are 0, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, and 1.0, respectively. The critical rod diameters of the MGMCs are evaluated to be approximately 4 mm, while that of the metallic glass phase alloy is found to exceed 5 mm. The Au weight fraction in all alloys exceeds 85%, thus satisfying the 18-karat hallmark (though it may be somewhat higher than desired in commercial jewelry).
