 <p id="Par2">One of the proposed explanations for the unusual pseudogap behaviour of cuprate superconductors is the formation of an electron nematic phase. Murayama et al. find magnetic anisotropy in the pseudogap regime of HgBa
  <sub>2</sub>CuO
  <sub>4+Î´</sub>, providing evidence for anomalous nematic ordering.
