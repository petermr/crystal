 <caption> Architecture of perovskite-based lasers. ( a) Simplified laser configuration. ( b) Principle of stimulated emission occurred in active media: SE—spontaneous emission, ASE—amplified spontaneous emission. ( c) Types of resonator’s geometries: DBR—distributed Bragg reflector, F-P—Fabry–Perot, RL—random lasing, WGM—whispery gallery mode. Insets in (c) are the examples of the morphology of perovskite materials used for DBR [ 82], F-P [ 83], RL [ 84], and WGM [ 85] resonators. Adopted with permission [ 82].
