 <sub>2</sub>O (17.36 g) was dissolved in a solution of 400 mL of dioinized water + 1 mL of HCl, then a mixture of FeCl

 <sub>2</sub>O (10.8 g) + 400 mL of dioinized water + 1 mL of HCl was added, the solution was aged for 48 h in argon medium, after which the precipitate was separated by centrifuging, and washed and dried in argon medium. The pH control was carried out using a pH meter and brought to a level of 9.3 by adding drops of an alkaline solution of NaOH. At this pH level, the formation of hydroxide inclusions is excluded, which was also confirmed using X-ray phase analysis, according to which hydroxide structures are not observed in the structure of the initial samples. Annealing of synthesized nanoparticles was conducted in an oxygen-containing medium in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 200, 400, 600 and 800 °C for 5 h.
