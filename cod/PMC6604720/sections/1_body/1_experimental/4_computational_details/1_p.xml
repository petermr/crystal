<p>To investigate the effect of europium dopants on the structural and electronic properties of Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> crystals, density functional theory-based calculations were also performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For the exchange-correlation part of the functional, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form was employed [
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In order to obtain the charge transfer between the atoms, the Bader technique was used [
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The kinetic energy cut-off for plane-wave basis set was taken as 400 eV for all the calculations. For all ionic relaxations, the total energy difference between the sequential steps in the calculations was taken to be 10
 <sup>−5</sup> eV as the convergence criterion. On each unit cell, the total forces were reduced to a value less than 10
 <sup>−4</sup> eV/Å. Г-centered k-point meshes of 2 × 2 × 2 were used for a 128-atom supercell of bulk Y(OH)
