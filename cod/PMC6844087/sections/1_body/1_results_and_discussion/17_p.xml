<p>Overall, the inverse effect that these conditions have on the final goal of this work can be seen: when the calcination is more intense, purity and sintering between particles increase; for soft calcinations, the sintering is lower and the product is less pure. Thus, an optimum balance between both variables needs to be found to have high-purity products and, at the same time, reduce as much as possible the sintering between nanoparticles.</p>
