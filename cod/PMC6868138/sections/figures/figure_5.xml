  <p>Influence of kinetics of chirality inversion on the reorientation. The spiral droplet shown here is doped with Me-
   <bold>m</bold>. When the light power is sufficiently low, the helical trajectory unwinds slowly and then rewinds with helix inversion. The insets show the structure of the droplet during motion, with straight motion being associated with the disappearance of the spiral organization in the compensated state. The direction of the motion is not modified significantly upon transition from helical to straight
