<p>As a check to better define the chemical nature of O(1′), the Ti–O(1′) bond distance was fixed at values indicative of Ti–OH bond distances (1.85 Å) up to values typically associated with the Ti–H
 <sub>2</sub>O bond distance (2.25 Å) at intervals of 0.05 Å, and the structure was optimized. This analysis in

 <sup>2</sup> of 0.1, providing further evidence that the contact layer contains only OH (i.e., 1.93 Å). All other bond distance values can be ruled out based on the uncertainty of the χ

 </sup> With regard to issue (ii), our best-fit structure derived from SXRD reveals an occupancy of 0.5 ± 0.02 for O(1′), that is, half monolayer coverage of OH, in agreement with ref (

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
 </sup> the present experiments are best described by a half-monolayer of a purely OH structure. This difference could, besides the delicate and highly functional-dependent energetics of water dissociation, be related to the fact that in the FPMD calculations, the H fragment remained bound to the surface, enabling stabilization through H-bonding. This indicates that the precise adsorbate coverage and structure of the surface could be sensitive to the pH of the aqueous phase, which affects the H coverage of the surface.
