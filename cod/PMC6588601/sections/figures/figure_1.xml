  <p>X-ray diffuse scattering. 
   <bold>a</bold> Experimental and 
   <bold>b</bold> calculated 3D constant-intensity surfaces for the X-ray diffuse-scattering intensity for a PbMg
   <sub>1/3</sub>Nb
   <sub>2/3</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub> single crystal at 300 K. The dark shade of blue marks the intersections of these surfaces with the bordering box. Note the distinct shape of the diffuse scattering at the 
   <italic>h</italic>00-type and 
   <italic>hk</italic>0-type locations. The 3D diffuse-intensity distribution was fitted simultaneously with the neutron and X-ray total scattering and extended X-ray absorption fine structure data, as summarized in Supplementary Fig.
