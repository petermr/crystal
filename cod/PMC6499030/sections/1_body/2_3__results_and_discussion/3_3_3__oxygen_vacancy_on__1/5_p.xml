<p>The four–layer slab used so far is clearly suitable to describe the relaxations in the top layers associated with the creation of the surface and the H–defect. In the case of the subsurface vacancy, where one of the reduced Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> ions is located in the third trilayer, one may wonder if an additional trilayer is needed in order to relax the local strain induced by the larger ion, as the fourth trilayer has been kept fixed. This strain can be more easily accommodated by atomic relaxations when the reduced ion is located in the first trilayer. This is consistent with the fact that the gap states associated with the two Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> ions have different energy, the one associated with the Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> in the top trilayer being lowered in energy. Thus, we have optimized the structure of a five–trilayer slab using AE–LCAO–HSE and keeping fixed the fifth (bottom most) trilayer. The structural analysis shows no significant differences, with very similar bond distances among the key atoms and the same surface relaxation pattern, where the O

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) shows that they are nearly identical. The position of the new localized states and local spin magnetic moment (0.94 and 0.93 μ

 </sub>) are also very similar to the ones calculated with four trilayers. These results confirm that when the donated electrons are accommodated in the described positions, a four–trilayer slab provides an adequate description.
