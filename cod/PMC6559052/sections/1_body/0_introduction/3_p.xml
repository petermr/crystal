<p>As for water adsorption on TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)-(2 × 1), this has been investigated with ex situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The results show that quasi-one-dimensional clusters populate the surface after exposure to 10
 <sup>–3</sup> Torr of water at room temperature.

 </sup> Repeated scans led to partial removal of these clusters, revealing a modified morphology. A first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) investigation

 </sup> provides some insight as to what the structure may be. It suggests that there is a significant rearrangement of surface atoms upon exposure to H
 <sub>2</sub>O, whereby the (2 × 1) reconstruction reverts to a (1 × 1) termination. It was also concluded that water dissociates at the interface to form a mixed molecular and dissociated overlayer (on average 3:1 H
 <sub>2</sub>O/OH) at saturation coverage, with adsorption at surface Ti sites (Ti
 <sub>5c</sub>). More recently, a room-temperature STM experiment investigated the effect of dipping TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011) into liquid water.

 </sup> This ex situ experiment identified a c(2 × 1) half monolayer overlayer of OH by comparison with DFT calculations, with removal of the underlying (2 × 1) reconstruction. Here, we employ SXRD to provide the first quantitative structure determination of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(011)/water interface, performing in situ data acquisition at room temperature with an approximate H
 <sub>2</sub>O coverage of 12 monolayers.
