<p>The objective model consisted of two Ag-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> core-shell nanoparticles placed on a Si substrate, without a gap between them. The diameter of Ag nanoparticles was varied in the range from 70 to 140 nm, while the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> shell thickness was adjusted to 2 nm, practically providing 4-nm gap between two nanoparticles. The optical influence from Au core nanoparticle in the electric field distribution around Au@Ag SHINs was evaluated by varying Au core size from 0 to 100 nm, while the size of Ag outer sphere and the gap between two particles were fixed at 100 and 4 nm, respectively.
