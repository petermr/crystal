 <caption> Schematic illustration of the diffusion of a proton hole center (PHC, marked in red; either O*H – adsorbed on Zn s 2+, or a “free” O s 2–) via a series of proton transfer (PT) events. The protons that participate in the next PT event are marked in blue, and the hydrogen bond along which they are transferred in magenta. Charges have been omitted for clarity. The figure shows only a schematic, general, representation of a mixed-terminated ZnO surface. The actual structure of the surface influences the possible sequence and rate of PT reactions. The liquid water film is not shown in the figure, although it is present in the simulations. </caption>
