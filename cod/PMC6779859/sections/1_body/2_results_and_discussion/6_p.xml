<p>A well-established strategy to reduce the effect of electron magnetic noise is by further dilution of the given single crystal. Nonetheless, this is not a useful method since it implies to move the Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ions away, which hence can result in an important alteration of the inter-qubit communication. Thus, one needs to choose a concentration that allows a robust qubit communication while keeping electron magnetic noise below a safe threshold. In a 100% concentrated single crystal of 
 <bold>1</bold> the minimum distance between pairs of Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ions is around 17 Å, while in our 1% working concentration this minimum distance is increased up to ~37 Å. If this distance is still too large and further approach of Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ions is required to allow a safe inter-qubit communication, one should first identify and suppress the other decoherence sources before rising the single crystal concentration.
