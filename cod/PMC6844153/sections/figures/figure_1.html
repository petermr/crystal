 <caption> Part of band structures of (a) bulk, (b) 7-chain, (c) triple, (d) double, and (e) single SCAC(s) V 2Se 9 from point M to point Γ. The zero energy is shifted to the maximum energy of valence band. The structures are optimized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) method with the DFT-D3 energy correction. Inset graphics represent the corresponding optimized structures of bulk and few-chain V 2Se 9. </caption>
