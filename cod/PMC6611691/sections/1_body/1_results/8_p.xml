<p>In 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, the MR data are rescaled to remove the |cosθ| dependence (as explained in section S2 and fig. S7). In this way, all the initial slopes collapse onto a single curve, as shown in the inset. Although the field scale has been substantially renormalized, the peak value 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub> plotted in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> still exhibits its own maximum at a specific critical angle of θ
 <sub>CR</sub> = −50° ± 2° from the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis. At this critical angle, the influence of the negative MR is, thus, at its weakest.
