A combined refinement of XRD and NPD patterns was carried out for both the compositions at 300 K in order to accurately quantify Ni and Re cation ordering and determine the oxygen positions. The refined structural parameters along with the bond lengths and bond angles are given in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> respectively. The ordering between Ni and Re is quantified to be 96% and 99% for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 and 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 from the refined occupation numbers of Ni1/Re1 and Re2/Ni2 at (0.5, 0.0, 0.5) and (0.5, 0.0, 0.0) crystallographic sites, respectively. The stoichiometry of Ni and Re in the compounds are probed and confirmed through ICP-OES experiments (see SI). The Bond Valence Sum (BVS) for Ni is calculated from the Ni-O bond lengths listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>
