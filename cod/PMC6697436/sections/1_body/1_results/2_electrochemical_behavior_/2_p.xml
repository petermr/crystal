<p>The catalytic kinetics for oxygen evolution is assessed by analysis of the corresponding Tafel plots. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, the resultant Tafel slope of the Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> single crystal is only 74 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is significantly lower than that of Ni foam (190 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>) and Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> microcrystals (95 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>), despite the fact that the latter two catalysts have much smaller surface areas. This result indicates the superior reaction kinetics on the bulk single-crystal catalyst. In addition, it is interesting to observe that the linear region of the Tafel slope is much wider than for most reported studies. It is well established that the Tafel analysis is based on the Butler-Volmer equation under the assumption of constant coverage of the intermediate species. However, both surface coverage of the intermediate species and the reaction constant are strongly potential dependent (

 </xref>). This well explains the rapid increase of the Tafel slope in the high-overpotential range. For Pt in 1 M KOH, this value increases from 60 to 120 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> when increasing the applied potential (

 </xref>,

 </xref>). The validity of the Butler-Volmer equation at such a large applied potential suggests a fast electron-transfer kinetics on the bulk single-crystal surface. We performed multistep chronopotentiometry measurements to characterize the kinetic behavior of OH group insertion. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, the current densities show a rapid response to the applied potential and remain stable in the following 500-s test. This suggests a fast charge-transfer and mass transport process, with the active species (OH
 <sup>−</sup>) at the crystal surface are oxidized rapidly when the potential is abruptly changed (

 </xref>). The 12-hour durability test reveals the high stability of the microcrystal with negligible loss of the anodic current (fig. S6A). This is further confirmed by the imperceptible variation in the LSV curve after the stability test (fig. S6B).
