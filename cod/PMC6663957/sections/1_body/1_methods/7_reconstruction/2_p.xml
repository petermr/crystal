<p id="Par42">All ring differences were used in the reconstruction. The number of rays in tangential direction for raytracing each LOR was 10 for both block and cylindrical geometries. For the data from 
 <italic>Scanners B</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>, attenuation and scatter correction factors were included in the standard factorized system matrix. The data from the 
 <italic>Scanner B</italic> were also corrected for normalization using the normalization factors calculated in the “
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Normalization</xref>” section. The number of voxels in each direction and the voxel size for the three different scanners are summarized in Table
