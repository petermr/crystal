<p>The first DoE planned in a wide range of conditions has been useful to confirm that the ferrite conversion improves for calcinations at high temperatures and long times. Moreover, temperature has been observed to have a stronger impact on the final properties than time. The second DoE has shown a plateau on chemical composition and magnetic properties above 850 °C. Therefore, the optimum conditions have been set to calcination at 850 °C for 30 min.</p>
