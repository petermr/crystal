<p id="Par31">The CPFE formulation for the helium-implanted sample was based on the hypothesis of removal of helium-implantation-induced obstacles by the progressive passage of dislocations. This leads to defect-free slip channels that accommodate deformation in the implanted zone, near the indent, and give rise to a large pile up. As a result, a more compact plastic zone is expected in the implanted material, which is clearly seen in the spatial variation of GND density predicted by CPFE and observed in experiments. An important point to note from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> is the size of the plastic zone surrounding each indent. The results show that, although the indent is only 500 nm deep, the affected zone extends beyond the ~3 µm thick implanted layer. This implies that the underlying substrate can have a significant impact on the results, even when the indentation depth is &lt;20% of the implanted layer thickness. Generally, when nano-indentation is performed on thin film on substrates, the contribution of the underlying substrate is carefully accounted for

 </sup>. However, in most studies investigating the indentation response of irradiated materials, indentation depth of ~20% of the implanted layer thickness is used and the effect of the underlying unimplanted material is not considered explicitly

 </sup>. Our result highlights that to ensure fidelity it is important to account for the combined effect of the implanted layer and substrate. An analysis whereby the implanted layer is approximated as an infinite half space may render inaccurate result.
