<p>A case study was carried in Alexandria that is considered to be the second capital of Egypt. The total area of Alexandria is about 2818.77 km
 <sup>2</sup> with total population of 5,163,441 and population density of 1831 per square kilometer according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Due to this high population density, the city is characterized by high traffic rate which has a great impact on noise level. The study was held in Elgeish road as one of the main roadways in Alexandria. It links the city from its east side starting from El Montaza station to its west at El Anfoshy station. This roadway always has high traffic stream and high noise level. For evaluation of noise levels in Elgeish road, three sample stations are selected along the roadway length to be monitored in this research. The stations are: Roushdy (ROS), Sidi Gaber (SGS) and Cleopatra (CLS) stations along the northern side of Elgeish roadway according to bus stops as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219373.g005">Fig 5</xref>. This side of the street is selected for the study as most of citizens’ activities such as running and cycling are done on this side of the street and it has wider sidewalk and most of vendors, coffee shops and change in the land use through the last 5 years happened at this side. No specific permissions were required for these locations as they are open public street stations in the city’s street and the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.
