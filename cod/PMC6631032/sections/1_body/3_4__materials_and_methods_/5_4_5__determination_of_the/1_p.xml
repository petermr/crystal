<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (0.25 mg) was hydrolyzed in 6N, HCl (1 mL). The reaction mixture was maintained in a sealed glass bomb at 104 °C for 16 h. The acid was removed in vacuo and the residue was re-suspended in 250 µL of water. FDAA solution ((1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-5-L-alanine amide) in acetone (115 µL, 0.03 M) and NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (120 µL, 1M) was added to the reaction vessel. The reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 2 h. Then HCl (2M, 60 µL) was added to each reaction vessel and the solution was evaporated in vacuo. The FDAA-amino acid derivatives from the hydrolysate were dissolved in 1 mL CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN and compared with standard FDAA-amino acids by HPLC analysis: LiChrospher 60, RP-select B (5 µm), flow rate 1 mL/min, UV detection at 340 nm, linear gradient elution from 9:1 0.1% aq. TFA buffer, pH 3: CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN to CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN, within 60 min. The absolute configuration of each amino acid was determined by spiking the derivatized hydrolysates with a 
 <sc>d</sc>,
 <sc>l</sc>-mixture of isoleucine.
