 <caption> Surface structure and OER mechanism. ( A) Detailed XPS analysis of the prepared single crystal. High-resolution XPS spectra for (A) S 2 p and ( B) Co 3 d. ( C) STM topography of a cleaved Co 3Sn 2S 2 single-crystal thin flake showing an area of 8 nm by 8 nm. The Kagome lattice is highlighted by yellow lines in the circle. ( D) Schematic representation of the favored OH uptake with the Co 3 d orbitals. The exfoliation between the S-Sn plane break the octahedral symmetry of the surface Co atoms in the Kagome lattice (highlighted by yellow triangle). The empty 3 d z 2 orbital points to the p orbital of the OH group, resulting in a strong bonding between them. ( E) Contour plots of the total charge distribution of Co 3Sn 2S 2 single crystal with one OH group bonded to the Co atoms. Electronic charges are distributed in the vicinity of Sn atoms. However, for Co atoms, one can see the electron transfer through the Coâ”€O bonding. a.u., arbitrary units. </caption>
