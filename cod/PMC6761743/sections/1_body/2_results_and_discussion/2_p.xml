<p>Also, understanding the origins of the structural defects in the aforementioned sulfides at the atomic scale requires to reveal the dissimilarities between the electronic and vibrational properties of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and those of sulfides that are metal-poorer relative to the former. To do so, the phonon band structures, electronic band structures, and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) were examined for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and metal-deficient models whose crystal structures were generated based on those of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu). More precisely, the unit cells of the models that are metal-deficient relative to MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) correspond to 2 × 2 × 2 expansions of the unit cells of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) (
