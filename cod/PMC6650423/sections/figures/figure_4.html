 <caption> Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. a Temperature dependence of 2 χ ab (upper panel) and χ aa  −  χ bb (lower panel) for p ≈ 0.11. b, c Same plots for p ≈ 0.12 and 0.125, respectively. Solid arrows indicate the onset temperatures of χ ab , which well coincides with T *, as shown in Fig.  1. Dashed arrows indicate the temperatures at which χ ab deviates from the extrapolation from high temperature shown by the bold lines. These temperatures are close to T CDW, as shown in Fig.  1. d χ ab , normalised by the values at T/ T * = 0.7 for different doping levels plotted as a function of T/ T *. The data collapse onto a universal curve, except for the low-temperature regime where a suppression of the χ ab is observed, indicating a scaling behaviour. Error bar represents s.d. of the sinusoidal fit to the τ 2 ϕ ( ϕ) curves </caption>
