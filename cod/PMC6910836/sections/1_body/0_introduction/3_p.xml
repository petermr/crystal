<p>In the realm of nanoscience, one of the most intriguing materials is tin (Sn) oxide, which is both inexpensive and abundant. Intensive researches have therefore been conducted with regard to a wide range of applications, such as in gas sensors, catalysts, and transparent conductors (

 </xref>). Size-controlled Sn oxide clusters with diameters between 0.9 and 1.6 nm were fabricated using a dendrimer template method. These materials showed a size-dependent composition variation such that the Sn
 <sup>2+</sup> fraction increases with decreasing size, while the catalytic activity during CO oxidation increased with decreasing size. However, the correlation between the chemical composition and catalytic activity is hypothetical at present. Therefore, a detailed comprehensive understanding of the chemical and structural states of Sn oxide SNCs is essential.
