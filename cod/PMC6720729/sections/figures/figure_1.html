 <caption> Topological phase and characterization of 1T’-WTe 2. a) Side and top views of lattice structures of 1T’-WTe 2. Brown spheres: tellurium atoms, blue spheres: tungsten atoms. b) XPS spectrum of W 4f (green line) and Te 3d (red line) peaks. c) TEM image and SEAD pattern of WTe 2, revealing the crystal structure of the 1T’ phase, with lattice parameters a ≈ 3.49 Å and b ≈ 6.32 Å, respectively. d) Raman spectrum of a 1T’-WTe 2 flake. </caption>
