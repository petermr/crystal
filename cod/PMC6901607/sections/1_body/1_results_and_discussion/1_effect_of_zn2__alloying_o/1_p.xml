<p id="Par6">The effect of the inclusion of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> on the structural property of CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> is investigated by measuring the XRD patterns. The XRD patterns of CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) for the different concentrations of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> confirm that the NCs have cubic structure and the phase is independent of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> content. The main diffraction peaks are at ∼15°, ∼22°, ∼30°, and ~38° corresponding to the (100), (110), (200), and (211) diffraction planes of the cubic crystal structure, respectively. However, there is some evidence that the structure of the CsPbCl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> NCs exhibit an orthorhombic phase at the unit cell level
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. The opposed orthorhombic subdomains of the NCs annihilate their superstructural peaks leading to a perceived cubic phase that is in reality pseudocubic. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the diffraction peak corresponding to the angle ∼30° for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> appears more discrete with a gradual increase in the content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>. This is an indication of the presence of the orthorhombic structure due to the octahedral tilting
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-alloyed CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs exhibit the diffraction peaks shifted towards a higher 2θ range. The shift corresponds to 0.174° and 0.276° for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> and CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs, respectively when the concentration of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> increases form 0% to 15% (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The observed peak shift is due to the lattice contraction of as-synthesized NCs within the unit cell. The size of the lattice decreases from 5.632 Å to 5.601 Å for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Cl
 <sub>3</sub> NCs and from 5.869 Å to 5.817 Å for CsZn
 <sub>x</sub>Pb
 <sub>1-x</sub>Br
 <sub>3</sub> NCs. The lattice contraction suggests that Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> cations with a bigger ionic radius (119 pm) occupying the B-site of BX
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra are being partially replaced by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> cations with a smaller ionic radius (74 pm) at the same lattice site of Pb
 <sup>2+</sup>. If Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> atoms have resided in interstitial sites, we would have observed a lattice expansion with increasing Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> content
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the incorporation of the smaller guest element Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the octahedra of parent CsPbX
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite structure results in the reduced size of the BX
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) that gives rise to the distortion and tilting of the BX
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. The octahedral tilting accompanied by the change in the lattice constant lead to the increased bandgap and blue-shifted PL emission at higher content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> which will be discussed in the latter part. Interestingly, the XRD scans do not indicate the presence of the additional peaks even after the incorporation of guest cation Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, signifying the absence of any crystalline impurities. Furthermore, the presence of a low angle (&lt;10°) peak in the XRD patterns indicate the presence of superlattice structures. The intensity of the superstructural peaks increases with an increase in the content of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> which indicates the enhancement in the periodicity of the NCs.
