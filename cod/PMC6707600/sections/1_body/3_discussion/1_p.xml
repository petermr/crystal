<p>Bardeen (1905) described that the chief features of the femur achieve the characteristics of the adult bone structure in the cartilaginous stage [
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Images of the lower leg including the femur were provided in this previous study; unfortunately, the precise features could not be confirmed in these images. Our study clearly showed the femur before ossification in gross 3-D view and revealed the timeline for the development of the chief features of the femur. In particular, the greater and lesser trochanters and femoral head at the proximal epiphysis and the lateral and medial condyles at the distal epiphysis were detected by the end of the embryonic period (CS23). The fovea and trochanteric fossa were prominent during the early fetal period. The timeline for the embryonic landmarks seems to be genetically determined. However, the subsequent differentiation of anatomic landmarks likely involves the contributions of synchronized development of the surrounding joints, tendons, and muscles, as these landmarks are components for the attachment of muscle tendons and ligaments and are susceptible to movement-related changes on the joint surface.
