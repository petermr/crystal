<p id="Par14">An 
 <italic>operando</italic> measurement system for LIB using synchrotron radiation soft X-rays exhibits photoelectron spectra at selected micro regions and photoelectron mapping of active materials during the charge-discharge condition. Development of an all solid-state-LIB with high rate properties allows for the experiment using synchrotron radiation soft X-rays with limited time. From the 
 <italic>operando</italic> analysis, important information on the charge-discharge mechanism of LCO is obtained. Generally, the redox reaction of LCO is discussed by using the formal charge of Co

 </sup> related by Li extraction/insertion. However, the Co spectra at the initial condition, and after charge and discharge conditions, are not changed in this 
 <italic>operando</italic> measurement. It is considered that the charge-polarization might occur at the oxygen side based on the strong hybridization between Co 3
 <italic>d</italic> and O 2
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals. Thus, the importance of 
 <italic>operando</italic> analysis of oxygen has been identified. Hereafter, in order to discuss the state of charge in our 
 <italic>operando</italic> measurement system, a novel configuration with a working electrode made of a single crystalline particle as an active material is necessary. Moreover, we will develop this 
 <italic>operando</italic> system for the analysis of electronic structure information at each facet of the single crystal and for visualization of the change in electronic structure by Li diffusion and redox reaction of elements in the host crystals.
