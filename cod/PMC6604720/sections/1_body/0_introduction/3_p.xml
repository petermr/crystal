<p>Phosphors mostly consist of thermally and chemically stable inorganic hosts such as YAG combined with rare-earth dopants (Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>, Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>, etc.) [

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Visible range emission from these phosphors, such as yellow, green or red, are in general the result of radiative energy transfer between partially filled 4f orbitals of dopant states together with the effective shielding of 5s and 5p orbitals [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity depends on the transition between 4f → 4f states; the transition from

 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> to

 <sub>4</sub> results in low intensity, while the transition from 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> to

 <sub>2</sub> leads to high PL intensity. Therefore, by manipulating the energy levels of the transition states through adjusting the dopant ion, different emission and PL intensities can be obtained [
