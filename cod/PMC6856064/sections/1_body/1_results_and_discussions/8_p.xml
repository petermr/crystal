<p id="Par10">In PKG-1, the wavelength of UV LED was 417 nm, while that of the blue LED was 452 nm. In the PKG-2, we used the same UV LED with a peak emission wavelength of 417 nm. However, we choose the blue LED with a peak emission wavelength of 455 nm. The combination of the 417 nm emission from the UV LED, and 455 nm from the blue LEDs were able to satisfy both the high efficiency of PKG (~ 100 lm/W) and the high color rendering indices (≥95). The EL spectra and the corresponding CRI points are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. In PKG-1, the total current was optimized at 60 mA (40 mA through two blue chips and 20 mA through UV chip). In PKG −2, 25 mA (15 mA through two blue chips and 10 mA through UV chip) was set. As seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a,c)</xref>, the emission from UV LED is high in PKG-2. The ratio of the current flowing through UV and blue LEDs was optimized to achieve a luminous efficacy of ≥100 lm/W.
