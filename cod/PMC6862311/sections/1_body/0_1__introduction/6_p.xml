<p>The present paper elucidates recent progress of AXCCA applied to soft condensed matter systems and is organized as follows. In the second section, a brief description of different types of structural order is given with the focus on the bond-orientational order. The third section provides basic theoretical description of the quantities used in AXCCA. The fourth section covers the application of the AXCCA to selected systems, such as LCs in the vicinity of the smectic-hexatic phase transition, colloidal systems, organic-inorganic mesocrystals, and solvated metal complex molecules. The fifth section completes the paper with a summary and outlook of the possible further applications of AXCCA.</p>
