<p>The upper NIR region (ca. 6900–6500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) is almost entirely populated by the first overtones and the binary combination bands of NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching modes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01402-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Other than this exception, the overtone bands of melamine may be described as non-essential for the other regions of NIR spectrum. Instead, the combination bands (binary combinations the most, ternary combinations to a bit lesser degree) play the primary role there. Again, the combinations that involve stretching NH
 <sub>2</sub> modes are the most important factor. The corresponding binary combinations provide very strong influence in the 6900–6500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region and throughout a broad 5100–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region. Ternary combinations that involve NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching modes only give weak influence in the region of 6500–6000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, where the spectral lineshape is rather flat. The highly populated region between 5100–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is mostly influenced by the combinations of stretching modes with deformation modes of NH
 <sub>2</sub> groups. The other influential factor is 
 <italic>ν</italic>C-N mode (both in ring as well as between C atoms in ring and NH
 <sub>2</sub> groups). However, the wagging NH
 <sub>2</sub> modes are largely suppressed. The modes that do not influence NIR region are as follows; overtones of
