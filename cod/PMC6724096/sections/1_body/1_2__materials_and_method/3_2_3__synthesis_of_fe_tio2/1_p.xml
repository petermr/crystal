<p>Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> were prepared by adding a varying amount of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O into solution A, as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-nanomaterials-09-01173">Section 2.2</xref>, and other steps were repeated as per 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-nanomaterials-09-01173">Section 2.2</xref>. In this experimental, 0.1351 g to 1.3510 g of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O were added to solution A; the molar ratios of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Ti
 <sup>4+</sup> were 0.5%, 1.0%, 3%, 5%. The resulting Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were called 0.5%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, 1.0%Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> et al.
