 <xref rid="B36-materials-12-01804" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the model of attracting rigid spheres used in crystallography literature to illustrate the concept of dislocation is misleading. In fact, this visualization does not describe the actual field of atomic arrangement for an edge dislocation. Atoms evidently cannot be modeled as rigid spheres: a cavity in the dislocation region of rigid spheres is about 6.5r
 <sub>o</sub> large, where r
 <sub>0</sub> represents the atomic radius, in this case, r
 <sub>o</sub> = 
 <bold>a</bold>/2 = 1.537 Å. In the actual dislocation, the depth is roughly about 4.736 Å, this is equivalent to 3.08r
 <sub>o</sub>, or about one half of the predicted value by the model of the rigid spheres. Indeed, the region near dislocations is not a cavity in the strict sense: in fact, the image reveals the presence of some electron density in the cavity. Cavities generated by the presence of crystalline structural defects have an interesting property that makes their presence experimentally detectable. Due to the low electronic density, if positrons are sent to this cavity, an electron and a positron form a pair. Since this pair is not stable, it decays into two γ-rays. Using a γ-rays detector, it is possible to count the number of events, which can be used for measuring the number of cavities present in a specimen [
