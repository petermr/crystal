 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (with 2 mol% excess MgO) were reacted at 1000 °C for 8 h to form MgNb
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>. This product was batched with a stoichiometric amount of PbO and heated in a covered crucible at 800 °C for 4 h to form phase-pure PMN. Prior to each heating, the powders were mixed and ground in a planetary ball mill in isopropanol using yttria-stabilized zirconia grinding media.
