<p>The structure analysis confirmed that SSZ‐27 is indeed a small pore zeolite. As mentioned earlier, the data also revealed the presence of a small, but noticeable amount of SSZ‐26. The framework structure of SSZ‐27 is characterized by two types of cavities (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> a,b). The larger, heart‐shaped cavity consists of 50 T‐atoms ([8
 <sup>2</sup>6
 <sup>10</sup>5
 <sup>10</sup>4
 <sup>6</sup>]), and has two 8‐ring windows with free dimensions of 3.6×5.5 Å (Supporting Information Figure S4), which are shared with a smaller cavity of 42 T‐atoms ([8
 <sup>4</sup>6
 <sup>8</sup>4
 <sup>6</sup>]). Each 42T cavity, delimited by a 14‐ring perpendicular to the 
 <italic>z</italic>‐axis, connects four heart‐shaped cavities together. Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the orientation of the heart‐shaped cavities with respect to the 42T cavities and the layer they form in the 
 <italic>xz</italic>‐plane. Each layer is shifted by (

 <italic>y</italic>‐axis, alternating between single 42T and two heart‐shaped cavities. The heart‐shaped cavities can be viewed as large side‐pockets. This means that despite this being a small‐pore zeolite, the internal volume is relatively large (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
