<p>The coarse radial collimator assembly is made of vertical and horizontal panels of B
 <sub>4</sub>C/fluoro­polymer-painted Al suspended from adjustable ceiling supports. The panels are constructed to form collimation cells for each detector column. To reduce the background contribution, the air in each cell is displaced by an Ar (ultra-high purity, 99.99%) filled ethyl­ene vinyl alcohol copolymer film balloon. The design allows easy access to the detectors for maintenance and reduces the shadowing on the detectors significantly. The array of detector stands was designed to allow a 2Θ coverage of 8–170° around the sample. The incident optics between the translation guides and the vessel were also redesigned to add two vacuum slits (one immediately following the translation guides and one just before the vessel) for improved beam spatial and divergence definition. In the standard configurations (as shown in Table 1
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref>) a beam size of 1 cm wide × 4 cm tall is used, but this can be adjusted as the experiment dictates. The maximum beam size that is achievable is 2 × 5.5 cm at a wavelength of 1.6 Å. However, the most intense part of the beam is contained within 1 × 4 cm. The new incident beam optics design incorporated bellows to extend the evacuated flight path and eliminate two upstream aluminium windows. An evacuated containment was also included in the design to accommodate, as a future option, a translator system that can move one or two 1.5 m focusing guides in and out of the beam position.
