 <caption> Comparison of the experimental diffuse reflectance near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of polycrystalline melamine with the calculated spectra. The spectra were calculated at B3LYP-GD3BJ/SNST level for an isolated molecule in two different anharmonic approximations (DVPT2 and GVPT2). In the GVPT2 calculation second overtones and ternary combinations were also included. ( A) 7150–5750 cm −1 region; ( B) 5400–4000 cm −1 region. </caption>
