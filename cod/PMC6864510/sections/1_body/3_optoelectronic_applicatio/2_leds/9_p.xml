<p>In order to achieve more efficient green light LEDs, the films are made of 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite nanosheets and CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> nanocrystals so as to provide an effective energy channel for the injection of excitons into the radiative recombination centers. However, there are still some problems with thin films, including crystallite distribution of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> nanocrystals and phase separation between the organic and inorganic phases.

 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0141" ref-type="ref">141</xref> Ban et al. demonstrated that the introduction of a crown molecule accurately controlled phase separation and improved film quality. Compared with CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> LEDs, the leakage current of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> with 40% PEABr is lower and the turn‐on voltage of CsPbBr
 <sub>3</sub> with 40% PEABr‐crown is further decreased. In addition, the current density and brightness are greatly improved (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>f). So, the final EQE of these LEDs reaches 15.5% at 510 nm.[qv: 134]
