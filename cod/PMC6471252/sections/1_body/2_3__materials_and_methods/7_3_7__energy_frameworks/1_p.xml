 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The model (termed CE-B3LYP) used B3LYP/6-31G** wave functions calculated applying molecular geometry extracted from the optimized crystal structure at ambient pressure. Pairwise energies are depicted via energy frameworks, whereby cylinders with thickness proportional to the magnitude of the interaction energy link the center of mass of the molecules. The idea of using energy frameworks to explain and rationalize the mechanical behavior of crystals at the molecular level was discussed by Turner and coworkers [
