<p>The magnetism observed is consistent with the presence of magnetic Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in our material, but to further confirm the electronic state of Eu in EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. The obtained data are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref> as the first derivative of the absorption data. We observe a sin-function-like strong broad curve when the applied magnetic field is swept to 2400 G, reaching its maximum around 3200 G. The intensity subsequently drops to zero at 3530 G, which indicates the applied field of the strongest absorption, and continuously becomes more negative, to ∼−6000 (in arbitrary units) at ∼3800 Oe, returning to zero intensity beyond 5000 Oe. The asymmetric line shape is as is usually observed in metals due to the skin effect caused by the small size of the single crystal used compared with the skin depth. According to the principal EPR equation, Δ

 <italic>h</italic>ν = 
 <italic>g</italic>μ
 <sub>B</sub>
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> where Δ
 <italic>E</italic> is the splitting energy, 
 <italic>h</italic> is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of the microwave used, which is 9481 MHz, 
 <italic>g</italic> is the Landé 
 <italic>g</italic>-factor, μ
 <sub>B</sub> is the Bohr magneton, and 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the applied magnetic field of the strongest absorption, we obtain the Landé 
 <italic>g</italic>-factor of 1.9184. Based on μ

 <sub>B</sub> and the 
 <italic>g</italic>-factor obtained from the EPR data, we obtain μ
 <sub>eff</sub> = 7.61 μ

 </sup> Therefore, we find that, for Eu in EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7/2 and that the Eu ground state is 
 <sup>8</sup>S
 <sub>7/2</sub>, i.e., that Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is the primary valence state for Eu.
