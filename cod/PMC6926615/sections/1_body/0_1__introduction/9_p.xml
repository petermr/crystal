<p>Since the perovskite materials possess high emission quantum yields together with tunable optical transitions (properties) varying in a wide range, these materials are prospective in utilization as an amplifying media in laser systems. It is also confirmed by the increasing interest of scientific society shown by growth of publications, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03845-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. In a recent review [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] by K. Petridis et al., success in development of lasers based on organic and inorganic perovskite materials has been shown. In their review, operational principles and laser configurations were covered along with future challenges, including realization of electrically pumped perovskite lasers, stability of the optical responses during the device operating, and search for other chemical compound configurations of perovskite materials. M. L. De Giorgi and M. Anni in their review [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] focused on approaches to optimize the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties in lead-halide perovskites including pumping regimes and configurations, including electrically pumped lasers.
