<p>The 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals were purchased from XianFeng Nano Corporation. A blue film was used to exfoliate 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> onto the N
 <sup>++</sup>-doped Si substrate covered with 285 nm of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> for Raman spectroscopy, ADRDM and electrical characterization. The substrate had pre-patterned alignment grids and 12 electrodes (20 nm Gr/180 nm Au). XPS analysis was performed on a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 device. The TEM images and SAED patterns were performed with on a FEI Tecnai F20 platform with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. A HORIBA HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with a 532 nm wavelength laser was used for the Raman spectroscopy analysis. Additionally, the thickness of 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> was confirmed using AFM (Bruker Dimension Icon) based on the sample thickness.
