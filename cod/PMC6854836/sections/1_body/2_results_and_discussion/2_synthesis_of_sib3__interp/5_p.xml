<p>Focusing first on the 1:3 reaction mixtures (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a), rates of formation are very low at 1150 °C. No silicon boride products were observed after 6 and 16 h. However, it was notable that amorphous boron started converting into crystalline β-boron with some Si incorporated (i.e., SiB
 <sub>36</sub>).

 </sup> This conversion was also observed for pure amorphous boron starting material in a control experiment (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02727/suppl_file/ao9b02727_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S17</ext-link>, Supporting Information). After 40 h, about 25% of Si had reacted with α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>. At 1175 °C, rates appeared significantly increased. Already after 16 h, the product contained about 25% α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, and after 40 h, virtually all Si had been consumed. The 40 h product corresponded to ∼90% α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and, surprisingly, ∼10% β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>. The product mixture after 80 h showed a slightly increased fraction of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>. At 1200 °C, reaction rates were increased again significantly. After 6 and 16 h, a 25 and 70% conversion to α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> was obtained, respectively. The product after 40 h was essentially the same as that obtained at 1175 °C after 40 h. Reactions at 1225 °C resulted in more than 50% conversion after 6 h and an essentially phase-pure α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> sample after 16 h. The PXRD pattern of this sample has subsequently been used for Rietveld refinement of α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> (cf. 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>, see later discussion). The 40 h experiment produced largely SiB
 <sub>6</sub>.
