<p>The PVP/N-CDot composites were prepared and drop-cast on glass slides using a fixed PVP content but varying amounts of N-CDots ranging from 15 to 50 µL. To investigate the effect of the N-CDot concentration on the resulting white-light properties, these composites were employed as color conversion layers over a blue LED chip (driving current of 0.25 mA). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> presents the PL spectra of the drop-cast green PVP/N-CDot composites on the glass slides. There are two different signals: the first one, at 450 nm, originates from the blue LED source, and the other one, at around 506 nm, from the emission of the N-CDots. As the N-CDot concentration increases, both the PL intensities of the blue LED light and the N-CDots decrease. However, comparing their relative intensity, the ratio of the blue and green emission peaks changes upon increasing the amount of the N-CDots. At the lowest N-CDot amount of 15 µL (pink line), the blue emission is dramatically more intense than the green emission. Their ratio decreases as the amount of N-CDots increases since the reduction of the blue emission proceeds faster than the enhancement of the emission of the N-CDots, and this ratio becomes almost one at the highest amount of N-CDots (50 µL, blue line). Meanwhile, the PL intensity of the resulting PVP/N-CDot composites drops dramatically as the amount of the N-CDots increases. Such a reduction is expected due to aggregation-induced luminescence quenching (AILQ) [
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], enhanced scattering, and the gradual transparency loss of the PVP, which increases the backscattering of light from the sample towards the LED. In

 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) together with the total visible light output (luminous flux) are presented as a function of the N-CDot amount. At the lowest N-CDot amount (15 µL), there is no valid registered CRI (filled circles) or CCT (empty circles) output. As the amount increases, the CRI increases linearly (solid line), while in contrast, the CCT follows a linearly decreasing pattern (dashed line). Therefore, the highest CRI of 89 and the lowest CCT of 5800 K have been obtained for the PVP composite containing the highest amount (50 µL) of green N-CDots. The LER value, presented as filled circles, follows a parabola function that reaches a maximum of 219 lm/W at a N-CDot amount of 35 µL. From 15 µL (180 lm/W) to 35 µL, the parabola has a positive slope, which is expected due to the decreasing blue-to-green ratio. However, at the highest amount of N-CDots, even though the blue-to-green emission ratio approaches unity while the overall emission reaches the lowest level, the resulting LER is reduced again to only 196 lm/W. The reason for this decrease may be the very low PL intensity (blue line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), which results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (

 <italic>N</italic>). The low 
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic> possibly causes an efficiency loss in the produced visible light output. Meanwhile, the luminous flux (empty circles) of the produced white light decays exponentially (dashed line) from 66.7 to 26.5 lm as the N-CDot amount increases. This behavior is expected since the total PL intensity of the PVP/N-CDot composites decreases dramatically as the N-CDot amount increases. Furthermore, the stability of the white-light properties of the prepared PVP/N-CDot composites against the driving current was also investigated (
