<p>K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> has a total hydrogen content of 5.11 wt.% and a possible reversible hydrogen storage of 2.56 wt.%. The dehydrogenation of K
 <sub>2</sub>LiAlH
 <sub>6</sub> was performed at 227 °C, while rehydrogenation was performed at 300 °C and up to 10 bar [
 <xref rid="B267-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. The rehydrogenation achieved 2.3 wt.% hydrogen storage, i.e., approximately 90% of the theoretical value. However, the reaction time was very long, around 280 h; and, perhaps a higher hydrogenation pressure would improve kinetics.
