<p id="Par10">There is another migration path with a low 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>mig</italic>
 </sub> (only 0.19 eV, 96
 <italic>h</italic>′–48
 <italic>g</italic>–96
 <italic>h</italic>′ migration path) between two 96
 <italic>h</italic>′ sites through the 48
 <italic>g</italic> site, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>(c). However, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, this migration path is the same as the 48
 <italic>g</italic>–96
 <italic>h</italic>′ migration path and is localized, so that the migration of O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> through the whole cell cannot occur only through this migration path. The 96
 <italic>h</italic>′–O–96
 <italic>h</italic>′ migration path is additionally needed to connect through the whole cell, as mentioned above.
