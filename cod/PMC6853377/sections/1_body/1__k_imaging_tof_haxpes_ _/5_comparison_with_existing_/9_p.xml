<p>So far, HAXPES was the domain of 
 <italic>hemispherical analyzers</italic>. Energy resolutions in the 100 meV range are routinely achieved at optimized beamlines, values of 55 meV at 7.9 keV (Takata 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb69"> ▸</xref>) and 71 meV at 5.9 keV (Torelli 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb71"> ▸</xref>) have been reported for measurements at the Au Fermi edge, comparable with our result for the W Fermi edge in Fig. 3(
 <italic>a</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref>. Hemispherical analyzers also dominate the field of photoelectron diffraction. One main emphasis in XPD was to observe the pronounced forward scattering along atom rows in off-normal directions (Fadley, 2010
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"> ▸</xref>; Fadley 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb19"> ▸</xref>), driving the trend to observe a maximum polar angular range. Large ranges of typically 0–60° can be scanned by varying the polar angle and rotating the sample about its surface normal (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb66"> ▸</xref>). Typical angular resolutions in both angular-scanning and display-type recording modes are ∼1°. In a few cases higher resolutions (&lt;1° FWHM) have been reached (Osterwalder 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb54"> ▸</xref>; Katayama 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb29"> ▸</xref>; Broekman 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> ▸</xref>). This approach works well in the hard X-ray range as demonstrated even with a laboratory X-ray source (Kobayashi 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb34"> ▸</xref>). In the present instrument, the angular range observable without scanning is given by the maximum 
 <italic>k</italic>-field-of-view (∼25 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>). The corresponding simultaneously imaged angular range varies from 30° half cone angle at 2.5 keV to 17° at 7 keV; details on this mode are discussed by Fedchenko 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2019
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb21"> ▸</xref>). Beyond that range sample rotation is required, which demands zero extractor field [see example in Fig. 2(
 <italic>c</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>]. In the high-angular-resolution mode (Δθ ≃ 0.1°), hemispherical analysers typically record a range of emission angles of ±7° (along one direction in 
 <italic>k</italic>-space).
