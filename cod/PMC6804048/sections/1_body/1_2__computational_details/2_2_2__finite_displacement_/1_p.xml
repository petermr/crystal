<p>Finite displacement (supercell) method was used to obtain the phonon DOS for compounds and elements. This method works by calculating the forces on atoms when perturbing the ionic positions [

 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The supercell size used for all compounds was 2 × 2 × 2. Convergence tests of the free energy with respect to the cut-off radius were done to achieve an error less than 1 meV/atom. By using the obtained phonon DOS and the formulae in [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the vibrational contributions to the enthalpy, entropy, free energy and heat capacity versus temperature, along with the Debye temperature, were obtained using the quasi-harmonic approximations.
