<p>High‐pressure and high‐temperature experiments were carried out in a KIWI 1000‐ton Kawai‐type multianvil apparatus installed at Yale University. A 10‐mm edge length Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>‐doped MgO octahedron with 5‐mm truncation edge length of WC anvils was used for pressure generation. A 40‐μm‐thick rhenium foil was used as a heater, which was inserted in a ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> thermal insulation sleeve for heating. A W
 <sub>5</sub>Re‐W
 <sub>26</sub>Re thermocouple was used to monitor the temperature. All the ceramic parts were fired at 1000 °C for 12 hr to remove adsorbed water prior to high‐pressure experiments.
