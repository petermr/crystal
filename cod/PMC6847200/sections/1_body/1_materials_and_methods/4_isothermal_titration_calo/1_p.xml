<p>RNA-ligand binding affinities were quantified by ITC using methods described previously (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). RNA was dialyzed overnight in ITC buffer containing 50 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 100 mM KCl at 4°C, similar to previously published conditions (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>). Ligand was dissolved in ITC buffer at 65°C and centrifuged to remove undissolved particles. Experiments were performed in triplicate using a Microcal ITC-200 calorimeter. Titrations were performed at 30°C with a reference power of 9 μcal/s. RNA was loaded into the sample cell at concentrations of 5–50 μM, after which ligand was titrated into the cell using the syringe in 19, 2.0 μl injections at concentrations between 50–500 μM. 
 <italic>c</italic> values were between 0.5 and 1120, with all but the weakest binders &gt;1 and all but the tightest binder below 500. Data were fitted to a single-site binding model with Origin 7.0 ITC software (Microcal Software) to determine the apparent dissociation constant,

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Data and statistical analysis was performed in accordance to best practice as described (
