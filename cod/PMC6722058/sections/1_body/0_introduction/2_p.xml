<p id="Par4">The last decade has witnessed clear advancements in synthesis and experimental structural characterization of very small, atomically precise hybrid nanoparticles with 1–3 nm cores made of metals, stabilized by various organic ligands

 </sup>. These particles are also called monolayer-protected clusters, MPCs, and they represent an interesting subclass of nanoparticles since their structures can be often characterized to atomic precision by using X-ray diffraction method on single MPC crystals. At the moment, more than 150 crystallographically solved structures of MPCs, involving noble metals, main group metals, and various ligand molecules such as thiols, phosphines, and alkynyls, have been reported
