 <sub>V</sub> was previously found to exhibit trimerons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), small polarons surrounding three Fe units that share corners with each other to build up a long-range ordered network as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. The end-to-end Fe–Fe distance in a trimeron is 6 Å, so their local lattice distortion lies within the First Unit Cell range (&lt; 9.4Å) and hence arises below the Curie transition as demonstrated in Fig.

 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> provides a mechanism for the coupling of the high-temperature structural fluctuations to the magnetism and hence for the origin of the Verwey transition as follows.
