 <caption> Torque magnetometry determination of nematic order. a The experimental configuration for in-plane torque magnetometry, by which magnetic torque τ =  μ 0 V  M×  H is mesasured. Yellow, green and red arrows indicate the directions of H, M and τ, respectively. The magnetic field H is rotated within the tetragonal ab plane. A single-crystalline sample of Hg1201 is mounted on the piezoresistive lever, which forms an electrical bridge circuit with the neighbouring reference lever. b Schematic picture of bond nematicity with B 1 g symmetry, where the nematicity appears along the Cu–O–Cu direction. For this nematicity, χ aa  ≠  χ bb and χ ab  = 0. c Diagonal nematicity with B 2 g symmetry, where the nematic director is along the diagonal direction of CuO 2 square lattice. For this nematicity, χ aa  =  χ bb and χ ab  ≠ 0 </caption>
