 </sup>, spherical objects containing two faces of distinct properties, such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. This asymmetry produces a self-propulsion in a given direction. The “activation” of a complex microswimmer could have important applications, for instance in drug delivery: a propulsion mechanism could enhance and direct the transport process with a consequent increase of its efficiency. Alternatively, some colloids could be activated by light or magnetic fields
