  <p>Emergence of the time-reversal type-II Weyl state. Schematic electronic structures corresponding to the structural fragment shown in the upper panel (from top to bottom): Fermi contour, band structure along selected directions, 3D E(
   <bold>k</bold>) representation in the whole BZ. 
   <bold>a</bold> 2D network of Bi atoms. 
   <bold>b</bold> Bi-network surrounded by Yb atoms in staggered geometry. 
   <bold>c</bold> Bi-network surrounded by Eu atoms in coincident geometry. Spinâ€“orbit coupling and perfect antiferromagnetism are taken into account in the calculations. White dashed lines in the lowest panel indicate where the sheets cross the Fermi level. 
   <bold>d</bold> Case with Yb and canted AFM which results in lifted degeneracy and creation of Weyl points. Inset to the lowest panel shows the cut through one of the Weyl points. 
   <bold>e</bold> Presence of the surface induces the non-trivial surface states (green planes) connecting the Weyl points (green points)
