<p>A typical metal oxide with mixed molecular/dissociated water adsorption is zinc oxide, ZnO. The interface between ZnO and water appears in, for example, medicinal chemistry,

 <sup>2+</sup> and O
 <sup>2–</sup> ion is approximately tetrahedrally coordinated. The 
 <italic>c</italic> crystal direction, with Miller indices [0001], is polar. Thus, the [0001] and [0001[combining macron]] crystal directions are not equivalent. The polar ±(0001) surfaces are less stable than the two most stable nonpolar (101[combining macron]0) and (112[combining macron]0) surfaces:

 <xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> for this reason, ZnO nanowires are normally longer along the ±[0001] crystal directions, exposing mainly (101[combining macron]0) and/or (112[combining macron]0) surface facets.
