<p>These Au@Ag NPs were then thoroughly covered with a pinhole-free silica shells with thicknesses in the range of 2 to 4 nm by the hydroxylation using sodium silicate (

Nine milliliters of as-prepared Au@Ag NP solution, placed into a 100-ml round-bottom flask, was added to 18 ml of Milli-Q water and 0.13 ml of 1 mM APTES aqueous solution and then stirred for 15 min at room temperature. The pH of the mixture solution was adjusted to &lt;5 by adding diluted sulfuric acid solution before adding APTES. Then, 1.07 ml of 0.54 wt % sodium silicate solution was added, followed by a 0.5 M NaOH solution to adjust the solution pH &gt; 11.5. Then, the mixture solution was kept stirring at room temperature for a while, where the shell thickness was controlled by the reaction time. Consequent silica-shelled Au@Ag nanoparticle (Au@Ag SHIN) solution was subjected to centrifugation at 5500 rpm for 15 min, where the supernatant was removed afterward. The concentrated Au@Ag SHIN pellet at the bottom of the microtubes was diluted with Milli-Q water and centrifuged again. This procedure was repeated several times for a cleaning purpose. When APTMS (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) was first used instead of APTES, as suggested in the original SHINERS methods for Au SHINs (

 </xref>), the consequent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Au@Ag SHINs revealed severe leakage of Ag, forming many Ag nanoparticles at a size of ca. 10 nm in diameter on the surface of Au@Ag SHINs, highly possible to interfere with sample SNCs. Therefore, it was replaced by APTES, where no Ag leakage was observed.
