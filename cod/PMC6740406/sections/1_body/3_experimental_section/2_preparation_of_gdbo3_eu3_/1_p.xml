 <sub>3</sub> (1.428 g), nitric acid (2.84 g), and PEG (4.42 g) were weighed, adding acetylacetone (4.32 mL) as the chelating agent, and mixed homogeneously with 100 mL of deionized water in a reactor. The reaction was allowed to be performed in conversional STR and RPB reactors, respectively. Afterward, 36 g of urea was added to the mixture and vigorously stirred at 90 °C for 1 h. The solid powder was separated by centrifugation and washed four times using deionized water and ethanol. The powder was dried at 80 °C for 5 h in an oven and then placed in a corundum crucible and covered up. After annealing in a furnace at 1200 °C for 5 h under an air atmosphere, the corundum crucible was naturally cooled down to indoor temperature. The phosphors synthesized by STR and RPB reactors are denoted STR-
 <italic>X</italic> and RPB-
 <italic>X</italic>, in which 
 <italic>X</italic> represents the reaction time of the reactants in the respective reactors (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 min, and 2 h).
