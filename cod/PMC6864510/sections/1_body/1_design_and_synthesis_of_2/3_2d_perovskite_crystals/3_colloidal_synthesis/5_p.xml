<p>Zhang's group selected toluene as a solvent and obtained (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbX
 <sub>4</sub> perovskite nanosheets. Then, they studied the effect of three solvents (chlorobenzene, chloroform, and dichloromethane) on the crystallization process.[qv: 15d] The results proved that lateral size of 2D perovskites is tunable through changing solvents. More importantly, single‐layer (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> is more stable under light irradiation and ambient conditions than the conventional 3D MAPbI
 <sub>3</sub> QDs. To synthesize corrugated (EDBE)PbBr
 <sub>4</sub> halide perovskite (EDBE = 2,2′‐(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium)), PbBr
 <sub>2</sub> was dissolved in nonpolar hexane containing octanoic acid; later, a turbid solution formed by injecting EDBE. The reaction solution was strongly stirred continuously for 24 h until a white colloidal solution was achieved (Figure

 <sub>4</sub> aroused by a 365 nm UV LED chip.
