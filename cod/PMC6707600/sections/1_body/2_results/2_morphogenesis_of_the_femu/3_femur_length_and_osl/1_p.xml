<p>Femur length showed a strong positive correlation with CRL (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.96) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Ossification in the femoral shaft was detected in all specimens with a CRL of ≥40 mm. Similarly, OSL showed a strong positive correlation with CRL (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.95) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The OSL-to-femur length ratio rapidly increased by approximately 50% in fetuses with CRL between 40 and 75 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The rate of increase became moderate in fetuses with a CRL of ≥75 mm, which reached to 70% in fetuses with a CRL of 185 mm.
