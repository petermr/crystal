<p>While in block copolymer surfactants only the handful of morphologies have ever been observed, it is seen in the compendium of hard matters or rocks and minerals that there are 230 space groups [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and possible real-space morphologies for each group are supposed to be numerous. The objective of this study is to unveil some of hidden morphologies in the molten AB and ABC copolymers over indwelling barriers. Those morphologies studied here are peculiar with various crystal symmetries such as Im3, Pn3m, and P432. Avoiding the lengthy steps from the synthesis of desired copolymers to structure characterization, we employ a field-theoretic simulation method based on a self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for copolymer systems with [

 <xref rid="B25-polymers-11-01081" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or without finite compressibility [
