<p>In conclusion, we developed a polyol synthesis process to obtain WO
 <sub>3-x</sub> NPs with tenable chemical, morphological, structural, and optical properties. This low temperature chemical route process offers a large-scale production of tungsten oxide versatile nanostructures. The as-prepared WO
 <sub>3-x</sub> NPs with oxygen sub-stoichiometric concentration, showed a very broad range of coloration from black to yellow (through blue-green colorations). Reducing conditions limit the crystallite growth, leading to NPs with pseudo-cubic structure with large oxygen sub-stoichiometry and with dark coloration, while oxidizing conditions promote the monoclinic structure organization with crystallites growth, with 50 nm diameter isotropic crystallites evidencing a light coloration. The monoclinic compounds obtained under the most reducing conditions exhibit an interesting reflectance contrast between UV, visible and NIR parts of the spectrum. Some of the as-prepared compounds exhibit a rapid and significant photochromic behavior. This photochromic behavior is highly dependent on the starting compound, showing that the photo-reduction of the tungsten ion is associated with the occurrence of pre-existing oxygen vacancies in the sample. A rapid and important change of colors was evidenced. The developed polyol chemical route clearly offers new perspectives of application for WO
 <sub>3</sub> NPs as solar filter in smart windows, or illustration (the transparence window of these compounds being limited to the visible part of the spectrum) and also for UV and chemical sensing applications.
