<p id="Par5">The paper is organised as follows. At first, we introduce GaV
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub> and summarise the known polarisation dependence of its Raman active modes. Then we briefly describe the orientation texture of our specimen obtained by the well established electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and we explain how the orientation can be obtained by Raman scattering only. Finally, we compare the results and conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of this fully optical method.
