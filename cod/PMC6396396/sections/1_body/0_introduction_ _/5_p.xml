 </sub>) in the range 0 ≤ 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 0.5. Geometrically optimized structures are studied in terms of superspace structural parameters, crystal chemical parameters, lattice parameters, total free energy and respective indications for the phase diagram of the system SiO
 <sub>2</sub>–Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. The results are compared with X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments. As there are several fundamental questions concerning the crystal structure and the phase diagram of mullite, it is an ideal playground to study the capabilities and benefits of first-principles calculations on modulated structures.
