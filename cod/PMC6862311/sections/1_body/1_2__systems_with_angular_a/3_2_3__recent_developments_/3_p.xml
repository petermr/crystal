<p>We should also note here that a few conditions should be fulfilled in order to observe speckles in addition to the high coherence of the X-ray beam. These include illumination times smaller than the characteristic time scale of the dynamics in the system; otherwise the collected diffraction patterns would be smeared due to time-averaging. The requirement of the short exposure times leads to another condition for the photon flux, which should be sufficiently high to produce enough scattering during the short X-ray pulse. Recently developed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) are capable to fully satisfy these requirements, which paves new ways for experimental studies of the structure of soft mater in general and the orientational order in particular.</p>
