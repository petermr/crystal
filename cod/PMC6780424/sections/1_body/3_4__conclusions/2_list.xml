  <p>We proposed a theoretical indicator 
   <italic>t
    <sub>initiation</sub>
   </italic> to characterize the shock sensitivity of an energetic single crystal, which has been proven to be reliable and satisfactorily consistent with experiments.

  <p>The shock reaction initiation was found to be a process driven by heat and pressure coupling and the vibrational spectra, the specific heat capacity, as well as the strength of the trigger bonds being the determinants of the shock sensitivity of energetic single crystals.</p>

  <label>(3)</label>
  <p>Intermolecular hydrogen bonds were found to effectively buffer the system from heating, thereby delaying the trigger bonds from breaking and ultimately reducing the shock sensitivity of the energetic crystal.</p>

  <label>(4)</label>
  <p>To synthesize advanced energetic materials with low shock sensitivity, small characteristic peak density of the crystal vibrational spectra, high specific heat capacity, strong trigger chemical bonds and high hydrogen bond amounts were theoretically recommended.</p>
