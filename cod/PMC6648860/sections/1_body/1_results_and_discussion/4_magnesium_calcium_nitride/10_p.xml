<p>Upon Ca deintercalation from CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>, electrons should be removed from the band structure. The calculated density of states (DOSs) for CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>B) shows that the N(2p) and Ta(5d) states largely hybridize below the Fermi level suggesting strong covalent bonding in within the TaN
 <sub>2</sub> layers. As previously reported,

 </sup> CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> is a bidimensional metal (no localized JT active Ta d
 <sup>1</sup> cations) with the Ca ions ionically bonded to the (TaN
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sup>2–</sup> layers. Two wide bands appear in the DOS: the upper and partially filled band dominated by the Ta d-states and the lower band (between −2 and −7 eV) which is mostly of N p character. Ca deintercalation from CaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> to form Ca
 <sub>0.5</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> would imply the upper band, this is to say, the oxidation from the formal state Ta
 <sup>4+</sup> to Ta
 <sup>5+</sup>. Beyond the Ca
 <sub>0.5</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> composition (or NaTaN
 <sub>2</sub> for the analogous phase), Ca de-insertion would reduce the occupancy of the lower N(2p)-band producing a large amount of holes and in the end nitrogen oxidation with concomitant structural degradation.
