 </sup>. The instrument consists of a Rigaku-Oxford Diffraction Supernova kappa-geometry goniometer equipped with an X-ray micro-source assembled with a Pilatus 200 K Dectris detector. The micro-X-ray source, MoKα (λ = 0.71073 Å) operates at 50 kV and 0.8 mA (power = 40 W). The micro source ensures a brilliance at least ten times higher than conventional sealed X-ray tubes and a beam spot of ∼0.120 mm. At the same time, the Pilatus 200 K detector ensures a very high sensitivity and negligible noise. Data collections have been performed using the Crysalis software (Rigaku-Oxford-Diffraction©) package. Data reduction, including intensity integration together with background and Lorentz-polarization corrections, have been carried out within the Crysalis package.
