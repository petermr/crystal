<p>HRTEM investigations performed on the obtained rod-likes particles show that they are mono-crystalline, with a lattice spacing perpendicular to the rod long-axis in the range 0.335–0349 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This is not consistent with the d-spacing of the (100) plane of the cubic structure observed in X-ray diffraction patterns about 3.7–3.8 Å. Regardless, an anisotropic crystal shape is also not coherent with a cubic unit-cell. It can be observed that the WO
 <sub>3-x</sub> compound is reported with numerous crystallographic unit-cells in literature. Indeed, numerous phases with WO
 <sub>3-x</sub> general composition with x changes from 0.08 up to 0.375, have been experimentally observed. They are W

 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01555" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These phases are characterized by the periodic organization of the oxygen vacancies associated with the periodic formation of [WO5] pentagonal bipyramids and/or [WO6] edge-sharing octahedrons with typically crystallite shapes such as nanowires, nanorods or nanosheets. Most of these phases have a large unit cell in which there are interplanar distances in the range 0.335–0.349 nm. Otherwise, hexagonal tungsten oxide nanorods, obtained by spray pyrolysis, were described by Nakakura et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-01555" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; the hexagonal phase is based on (100) d-spacing equal to 0.67 nm, two times the herein observed lattice spacing, which is not so far. In conclusion, the rod-like particles formed under electron beam focalisation surely originate from a photo-electron reduction associated with a drastic phase transformation; the mostly sub-stoichiometric oxide (black sample prepared under the most reducing conditions) is logically expected to be the most reactive.
