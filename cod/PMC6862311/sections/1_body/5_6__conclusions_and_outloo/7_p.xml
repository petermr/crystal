<p>Fortunately, the brightness of the modern X-ray sources already provides a sufficient flux of coherent photons for studies of the soft matter. Nowadays, the most advanced diffraction limited storage rings (DLSR) are specially designed to supply the highest possible coherent photon flux. Currently, the first multiband-achromat synchrotron source MAX IV (Lund, Sweden) is already under operation, and several more synchrotron sources are under commissioning, upgrade or in the planning stage. These are, for example, SIRIUS (Campinas, Brazil), ESRF-EBS (Grenoble, France), APS-U (Argonne, USA), and PETRA IV (Hamburg, Germany). The higher degree of coherence from these new sources would increase the contrast of the diffraction patterns, which would result in a higher signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
