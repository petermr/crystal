<p>The polarized emission from well‐aligned semiconductor QRs has a great potential to improve the efficiency of modern LCDs, and there have been several approaches demonstrated in literature to realize such an alignment, as summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="advs1374-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. While DOPs of resulting systems may not be sufficient to completely eliminate the need for the polarizers, they can reduce losses in the LC polarizer considerably. Photoaligned QREFs employing semiconductor QRs with polarized emission for brightness enhancement of the BLUs have been demonstrated, and these showed improved light efficiency in addition to color enhancement for LCDs.[qv: 35c,39] Additionally, the dipolar emission of the QRs offers higher output light coupling in comparison to QDs. For the LCD backlight application, there are two scaling factors for the QREF brightness: i) the PLQY of the QR and ii) the DOP of the aligned QREF. Thus, for the real benefits it is important to achieve both high PL QY and high DOP in the QREFs. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1374-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref>b shows that the brightness of the LCD can be increased from 4.8% to 7.9%. The narrower emission (FWHM &lt; 30 nm) and shorter emission wavelength for the green emitters (PL maximum ≈520 nm) would further help to enhance the color performance of the QREF. This can be achieved by both optimization of the traditional QR synthesis or by employment of alternative nanomaterials with polarized emission such as II‐VI semiconductor nanoplatelets, or perovskite nanocrystals.
