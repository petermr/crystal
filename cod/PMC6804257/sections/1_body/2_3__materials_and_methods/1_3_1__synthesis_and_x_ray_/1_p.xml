<p>The macrocycle H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 was synthesized by a cyclization reaction between 1,4-diaminobutane and EDTA dianhydride, O(OCCH

 <sub>2</sub>O, according to the methodological procedure reported previously in Reference [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The formation and purity were confirmed by the melting/decomposition point, electrospray-ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Single crystals of L14 were grown by slow evaporation from an ethanol solution of the receptor in a glass vial. The X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker D8 QUEST diffractometer system, equipped with a multilayer mirror monochromator and a Cu Kα microfocus sealed tube (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 120.0 K. The absorption effects were corrected by the multi-scan method (SADABS). Direct methods [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were employed to solve the structure through the ShelXT [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] structure solution program, and the refinement was performed with the ShelXL [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] refinement package with least squares minimization. Both programs were implemented in the Olex2 software. The crystal was modelled as a non-merohedral twin with the volume ratio of two twin domains refined at 67.8:32.2, and the structure analysis was performed with Mercury 3.9 [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Crystallographic data for the H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 receptor were deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as Supplementary Publication no. 1950325.
