<p>Few examples of the composites of Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> were found during the preparation of this review; they are, in summary: Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>-NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B211-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>,
 <xref rid="B212-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>], Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>-MgH
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B213-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>], Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>-LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B214-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>,
 <xref rid="B215-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>], and Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>-Ca(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B216-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. The original reports include several stoichiometries and preparation procedures. However, they have the reduction of dehydrogenation temperature as compared with the individual components and a relatively high amount of hydrogen released during the first dehydrogenation step in common. In many cases, the role of Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is classified as a catalyst of the other components of the mixture. Usually, the first dehydrogenation step corresponds to the decomposition of Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, i.e., reaction (42). Afterwards, MgH
 <sub>2</sub> reacts with other components of the mixture. For example, in the Mg(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>-NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> composite, NaMgH
 <sub>3</sub> was formed, and the proposed reaction is [

 <disp-formula>2Na
  <sub>3</sub>AlH
  <sub>6</sub> + 6MgH
