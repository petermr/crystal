 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the fluorescence response of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> with concentration of 0.01–500 ppm in the background solutions of deionized water, deionized water with 10 ppm Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, reclaimed water and sea water. In the deionized water, the QDs reveal positive dependence of fluorescence response with Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration. The concentration linear range is from 10
 <sup>−2</sup> to 500 ppm in the logarithmic coordinates. If the sensitivity is defined as the slope of fluorescence response against target pollutant concentration in the logarithmic coordinates, it is evaluated to be 0.073 for SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs in deionized water for Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> detection. However, the response appears to be degraded in the presence of 10 ppm Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, which is competitive to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> in the deionized water. A similar dependence was also observed for the fluorescence response of QDs in reclaimed water, because it contains impurities of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>. They were also responsible for the non-linear correlation at the high Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration over 100 ppm. The limit of detection is the least concentration of target pollutant, which can stimulate detectable fluorescence response of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01294-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the limits of detection are 0.01 ppm with the responses of 1.26 and 1.01 in deionized water and reclaimed water, respectively. The fluorescence illustrated a different performance in case of the sea water background. The response is between 2.06 and 2.42 within the Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration range of 0.01–500 ppm, being less sensitive to the target ion. It would be ascribed to the cations of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K+, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> as well as anions of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> and SO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sup>−</sup>, which may interfere with the detection of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> by their competitive interaction with SnO
 <sub>2</sub> QDs.
