<p>As part of its life cycle the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite invades a red blood cell, where it catabolizes hemoglobin to grow and multiply. The hemoglobin, on digestion in the parasitic digestive vacuole, releases iron-containing heme molecules, which are toxic to the parasite. The heme is rendered inert by crystallization into hemozoin. We have recently shown that the parasite stores large quantities of hemoglobin in its digestive vacuole (
