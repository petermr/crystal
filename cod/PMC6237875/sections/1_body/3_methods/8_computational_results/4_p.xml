<p id="Par47">Analyzing the bonding of the investigated silica phases by the Bader analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), we conclude that the ionicity of the coesite-IV and coesite-V phases does not change qualitatively, as compared with that of stishovite/CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and α-PbO
 <sub>2</sub> phases.
