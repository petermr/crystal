 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f004">Figure 4</xref> is a Weibull distribution of DC breakdown strength for the four kinds of polyethylene with different densities. The shape parameters and characteristic breakdown strengths for the four kinds of polyethylene are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The shape parameter indicates the dispersion of the breakdown data, and the characteristic breakdown strength represents the electric field strength when the overall sample reaches a 63.2% breakdown probability. It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02657-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> that the breakdown strength for the four kinds of polyethylene is different, and that the breakdown strength of LDPE is the lowest. The breakdown field strength of HDPE, MDPE, and LLDPE is 37.96%, 28.56% and 15.01% higher than that of LDPE, respectively. It can be concluded that the breakdown strength for the four kinds of polyethylene increases with the increase of crystallinity, mainly because the free volume of polyethylene becomes smaller as the crystallinity increases. Thereby, the free path of electrons is reduced, it becomes difficult for them to accumulate energy in the electric field, and the probability of electrons accelerating under the electric field is lowered so that the breakdown strength is correspondingly increased [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02657-f004">Figure 4</xref> that the larger the shape parameter, the smaller the dispersion of the breakdown strength data. The polyethylene exhibits more stable dielectric properties.
