 <caption> Strongly anisotropic compression induced band structure change of (PEA) 2PbI 4. ( A) Unit cell configuration under 0 and 4 GPa obtained from first-principles calculation. ( B) Illustration of the compression and decompression process under hydrostatic high pressure. The springs represent the pairs of PEA molecules, which can elastically shrink and stretch, thus self-adapting to different pressures. ( C) Schematic of a single type I quantum well with inorganic layer sandwiched by organic layers. Bound states exist in both the upper and bottom halves of the quantum well, stemming from the confinement of electrons and holes. ( D) Projected density of states (PDOS) on each atom in (PEA) 2PbI 4 and the corresponding band structures at 0 and 4 GPa. The band structure diagram is shown in a particular symmetry direction along L-Î“- Z to emphasize the bandgap. The full version can be seen at fig. S3. ( E) The energy positions of bound states as functions of barrier potential. The first and second bound states E 1 and H 1 are in orange and cyan, and E 2 and H 2 are in gray. ( F) The pressure dependence of the barrier potential ( U e and U h are in orange and cyan traces) and the weakening of quantum confinement (black trace). </caption>
