<p id="Par4">Coesite, a dense silica polymorph, remains a subject of intense studies at high pressures and variable temperatures. At ambient conditions, coesite has a monoclinic crystal structure (space group 
 <italic>C</italic>2/
 <italic>c</italic>, further called “coesite-I”) and above ∼20 GPa, it undergoes a phase transition with doubling of the unit cell parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> (space group 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic>, “coesite-II”)

 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra linked through vertexes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>). Above 31 GPa, coesite-II transforms into a phase tentatively indexed as triclinic (“coesite-III”)

 <sub>6</sub> octahedra) through a series of triclinic intermediate phases featuring both SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra and SiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. Further first-principles calculations made by Liu et al.

 </sup> suggest that post-stishovite phase should eventually transform to the one with α-PbO
 <sub>2</sub> structure. So far, the structures of coesite-III and other possible high-pressure polymorphs of coesite remain unknown calling for further investigations.
