We started with a random distribution of Mg and Nb on the octahedral sites and fitted these 3D peaks while swapping the locations of the two cations according to the RMC procedure. No atomic moves other than the Mg/Nb swaps were allowed at this stage. The distance dependence of the Warren–Cowley short-range order parameter

The order parameter for the first coordination sphere is at ≈70% of its maximum possible value. Similar results were obtained by starting with a rocksalt-type ordered arrangement of Nb and Mg instead of their random distribution.
