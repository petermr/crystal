<p id="Par28">In all studied cases, the best-ranked structures essentially reproduced the bonding configuration of metal-ligand interfaces found in the crystal structure, with minor RMSD values in the predicted interface atom positions with respect to the crystal structure. We successfully predicted also the metal-ligand interfaces consisting of different kind of ligands (thiolates and phosphines), for which the prediction was made in steps by first predicting the most stable configurations of thiolates that are in majority and then predicting the positions of the phosphines that were in minority. In general, we expect that by applying structure optimization methods, a majority of the best model structures would relax to the known experimental structure. For the largest clusters studied in this work we also expect that a number of predicted best-ranked interface structures would lead to locally stable low-energy isomers lying energetically close to the known crystal structure. In this sense, our method should be useful in producing a number of potential structural isomers in a systematic and computationally effective way. These isomeric structures can then be examined with more robust energy-optimization methods such as DFT or DFT-based tight-binding methods. Since the spatial constraints from the ligand layer (i.e., the steric volume of the ligand molecule) are also parametrically included in the algorithm, we showed that our method can provide qualitative understanding on how the bulkiness of the ligand affects structures, interface conformations and compositions of the protected clusters.</p>
