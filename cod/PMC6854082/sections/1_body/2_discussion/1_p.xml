<p id="Par18">In summary, we put forward a phenomenon (dubbed as BSVSP) in nonmagnetic inversion-asymmetric systems: band splitting induced by inversion-symmetry breaking, while the net spin polarization is zero. This phenomenon is rationalized in terms of protection by non-pseudo-polar symmetries. The BSVSP behavior can occur not only in symmorphic but also in non-symmorphic systems, as shown by our density functional theory calculations demonstrating that BSVSP takes place in bulk GaAs and 2D ferroelectric SnTe. BSVSP is not only interesting from the physics point of view, but also promising for applications. For instance, we propose a linear magnetoelectric coupling in reciprocal space, which can be adopted to tune the spin polarizations of Bloch states by means of an external electric field.</p>
