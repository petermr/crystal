<p>The swelling capacity and gelling values of the four kinds of montmorillonite were determined according to the literature [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f011">Figure 11</xref>). As we can see from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f010">Figure 10</xref>, there are significant differences in the hydration properties of montmorillonites with different charge densities. The lower the layer charge density, the higher the swelling capacity and gelling values. The swelling capacity and gelling values of the montmorillonite with a charge density of 0.38 are 22 mL/g and 5.5 mL/g. The swelling capacity and gelling values of the montmorillonite with a charge density of 0.69 are 8.5 mL/g and 2.9ml/g, which indicates that as the charge density of montmorillonite increases, the hydration expansion and dispersion performance of montmorillonite decrease, which is consistent with the results of the previous molecular simulation.
