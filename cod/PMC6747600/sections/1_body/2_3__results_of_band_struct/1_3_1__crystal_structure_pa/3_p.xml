 </inline-formula> decreases with the increase of transition-metal number inside the same row of the Periodic Table, but becomes larger while passing from the fourth to the fifth and sixth rows. This behavior correlates with the atomic radii of metal atoms. Interestingly, while, for the fourth-row transition-metal monosilicides, the calculated values of lattice constants are smaller than the experimental ones, for the fifth- and sixth-row monosilicides, the theoretical lattice parameters are larger than the experimental ones. The maximum deviation of theoretical
