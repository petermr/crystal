  <p>(a) THTR stepped model of the Si(110)-(16 × 2) surface (positive buckled configuration). The atoms of the first, second and third layers are marked in blue, green and white, respectively. The black circles indicate the positions P1–P5, where the bright spots in STM images are expected according to T. Yamasaki et al. [
   <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. (b)–(e) Calculated constant-current STM images using the THTR stepped model, 
   <italic>U</italic> = −1.0 V. (b), (d) Positive buckled configuration. (c), (e) Averaged STM image using positive and negative buckled surface configurations. The unit cell is outlined in (a), (b) and (c). The image size in (d), (e) is 150 × 150 Å
