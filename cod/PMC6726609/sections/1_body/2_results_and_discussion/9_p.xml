<p id="Par19">In order to prove that the electrode exhibit excellent performance. TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the comparison between this work and some Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>-based or Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>-based in previous literature, which can be reflected that the values in three-electrode system are lower than those reported, but a highest specific capacitance is displayed in two-electrode system, implying a enough utilization of the electrode.
