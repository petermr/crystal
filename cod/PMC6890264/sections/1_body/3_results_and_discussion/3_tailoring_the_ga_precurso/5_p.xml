 <sub>2–

 </sub>S NCs, the topotactic, partial, and self-limited character of the exchange was attributed to the high energy barrier associated with the conversion of the hexagonal close-packed anionic sublattice of the parent low-chalcocite Cu

 <sub>2</sub> requires only minor rearrangements of the sulfide sublattice with respect to that of the template NCs (1.4 and 6.4% contraction within and between the hexagonal S
 <sup>2–</sup> layers, respectively).
