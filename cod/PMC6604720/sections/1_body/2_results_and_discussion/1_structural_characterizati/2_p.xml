<p>The SEM images demonstrate the morphology of the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> crystals fabricated at varying times in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>–c, from 5 to 60 min, respectively. The change in morphology of the crystals is evident. The phosphors obtained at 5 min of reaction time show a needle-like shape with nanometer-scale size distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). After 15 min of reaction, the crystals grow larger and started to show a rod-like structure with sub-micrometer sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). As the reaction time is extended to 60 min, the crystals transform into a rice-like structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). For more detailed information about the morphology of Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:7.5% Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> crystals, general TEM and HAADF-STEM micrographs of the sample prepared at 60 min are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>–f. A multipod-like structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) together with the rice-like structures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>,f) were obtained. Higher magnification images, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, indicate that the multipod-like structures are the result of the reunion of rice-like structures. On the other hand, the higher magnification images on the rice-like shapes demonstrate that these structures have fringed edges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), which may be the ensemble of ≈10 nm thick individual nanowires.
