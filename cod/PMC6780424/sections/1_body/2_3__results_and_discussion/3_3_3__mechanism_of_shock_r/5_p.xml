<p>From the explanation above, the initiation of the shock reaction of energetic single crystals is shown to be a process driven by the coupling of heat and pressure. The heat is derived from the mechanical work of the shock compression and is transferred into the vibration of the lattice, the molecules and the chemical bonds of the shocked material. Denser characteristic peaks of vibrational spectrum correspond to a larger amount of heat generated by the shock. Driven by the heat, the temperature of the system quickly increases and the stretch vibrational modes of the chemical bonds are activated. While vibrating, the chemical bonds also endure plastic deformation under the shock compression. When the deformation of the trigger bond is beyond the critical level, the shock reaction begins.</p>
