<p>Although several PROG co-crystals have been reported in past years, a detailed and reliable structure-activity correlation is still yet to be established between the co-crystal structure and its mechanical properties [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-03936" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As part of an ongoing study in crystal engineering, we investigated a series of co-crystals formed by PROG and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (CNA), PROG and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and PROG and 4,4â€²-biphenol (DOD), see in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-24-03936-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>. The co-former molecules were chosen based on their ability to interact with the carbonyl group of PROG via the formation of multiple strong hydrogen bonds. In this way, the carbonyl group of PROG acts as a hydrogen bonding acceptor while the co-former becomes a hydrogen bonding donor. This may promote the formation of co-crystals with an abundant weak interaction network. The preparation of the co-crystals was carried out using a slow evaporation technique. Several techniques were used to investigate the formation of the co-crystals, such as X-ray diffraction, thermal techniques, and spectroscopic techniques [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-03936" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Single crystals of PROG-CNA, PROG-DHB, and PROG-DOD were obtained and characterized by X-ray diffraction to determine their crystal structures. This extensive investigation involved powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), FT-IR spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to validate the formation of co-crystals and their aforementioned binding modes. After the co-crystal screening, in vitro dissolution experiments were performed to explore the change in solubility and dissolution rates compared to bare PROG.
