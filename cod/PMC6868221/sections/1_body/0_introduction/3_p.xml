<p id="Par4">The microstructural homogeneity is visible by the TEM micrographs where there is a consistent nano-scale microstructure with equiaxed grains with grain sizes of ~40 nm and ~35 nm at the center and edge of the disk after 100 HPT turns, respectively. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns at both the disk center and edge (Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) show spot-distributions on Debye-Scherrer rings indicating the polycrystalline aspect of ultrafine grain sizes within the illuminated volume, indexed solely as 111, 200, 220 and 331 reflections of an

 <sub>2</sub> and Al
 <sub>12</sub>Mg
