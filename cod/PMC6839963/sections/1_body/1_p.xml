<p id="P3">Early in the days it was noticed that empty fullerenes would not rotate as freely if they were captured in non-covalent complexes as co-crystals.

 </sup> This way a precise molecular structure of many fullerenes got to be known with a little to no disorder.

 </sup> It was also found that the orientation of the M
 <sub>3</sub>N cluster is very sensitive to its exact composition â€“ be it monoionic Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N or a mixed-metal LnSc
 <sub>2</sub>N system with Ln = La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Er, or Dy.

 </sup> Taking into account a very low barrier of inner rotation for the M
 <sub>3</sub>N clusters, this is a remarkable observation of great importance in EMF chemistry. Although the ordering effect has already been known for years, it would be fair to say that its origin is still not well understood. However, it would be of great use to know the exact energy scale of the effect and if it has a local or cooperative nature to strategize the search for and design of EMF materials as the ability to form ordered arrays is an important criterion.
