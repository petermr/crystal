<p>The complexes 
 <bold>A</bold>–
 <bold>D</bold> all form through some manner of cooperative CO
 <sub>2</sub> activation. In each case, the small‐molecule substrate is cleaved as a result of combined interaction with either more than one metal centre (
 <bold>B</bold>, 
 <bold>C</bold>/
 <bold>D</bold>), or with both a metal centre and a “non‐innocent” ligand (
 <bold>A</bold>, 
 <bold>C</bold>/
 <bold>D</bold>). On this basis, we reasoned that the use of other ligands capable of metal–ligand cooperation (MLC)
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> should allow us to expand the range of structural motifs available for mediating challenging CO
 <sub>2</sub> cleavage reactions at late 3d metals.
