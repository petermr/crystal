 <p>We are grateful to Prof. V.E. Asadchikov, Dr. D.A. Zolotov for their permanent interest and fruitful discussions concerning the present study and special thanks to Dr. A.V. Buzmakov for his assistance of solving some issue to build the 3D PCTD displacement field numerically simulated and retrieved. This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education within the State assignment FSRC «Crystallography and Photonics» RAS in part of developing methods of structural analysis using X rays and synchrotron radiation and in part of “the application of model approaches for localized identification of micro-defects in single crystals by the method of X-ray diffraction topo-tomography”, the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project no. 18-52-7819).</p>
