<p>Currently, only a handful of examples of CO
 <sub>2</sub> cleavage based on 3d metals are known (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201909240-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> In 2005, Sadighi et al. reported abstraction of an oxygen atom from CO
 <sub>2</sub> by NHC copper boryl complexes (NHC=N‐heterocyclic carbene), resulting in formal O atom insertion into the Cu−B bond to give compound 
 <bold>A</bold>.

 <sup>II</sup> complex 
 <bold>B</bold> containing bridging CO and O
 <sup>2−</sup> ligands, which was prepared by reaction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> with an Fe
 <sup>I</sup> precursor (similar results were also published by Holland et al. shortly thereafter).

 <sub>2</sub> activation sequence mediated by a nickel pincer complex, involving the cleavage of a ligand C−P bond as well as one CO
 <sub>2</sub> C=O bond to give the products 
 <bold>C</bold> and 
 <bold>D</bold>.
