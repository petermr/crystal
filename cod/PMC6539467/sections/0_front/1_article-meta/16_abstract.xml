 <p>The 
  <sup>1</sup>H chemical shielding anisotropy (CSA) is an NMR parameter that is exquisitely sensitive to the local environment of protons in crystalline systems, but it is difficult to obtain it experimentally due to the need to concomitantly suppress other anisotropic interactions in the solid-state NMR (SSNMR) pulse sequences. The SSNMR measurements of the 
  <sup>1</sup>H CSA are particularly challenging if the fast magic-angle-spinning (MAS) is applied. It is thus important to confront the results of both the single-crystal (SC) and fast-MAS experiments with their theoretical counterparts. Here the plane-waves (PW) DFT calculations have been carried out using two functionals in order to precisely characterize the structures and the 
  <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shielding tensors (CSTs) of the solid forms of maleic, malonic, and citric acids, and of L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate. The level of agreement between the PW DFT and either SC or fast-MAS SSNMR 
  <sup>1</sup>H CSA data has been critically compared. It has been found that for the eigenvalues of the 
  <sup>1</sup>H CSTs provided by the fast-MAS measurements, an accuracy limit of current PW DFT predictions is about two ppm in terms of the standard deviation of the linear regression model, and sources of this error have been thoroughly discussed.
