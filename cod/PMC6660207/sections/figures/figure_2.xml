  <title>Spectroscopic measurements of 2D perovskite (PEA)
   <sub>2</sub>PbI
   <sub>4</sub> under high pressure.

  <p>The dotted arrows in all panels point to the direction of increasing pressure. (
   <bold>A</bold>) PL spectra excited by 2.62-eV (473-nm) blue laser. The last few spectra when pressure exceeds 4.5 GPa look flat due to low intensity. Intensity axis shows real counts per second (cps) as excitation power is fixed. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Zoom-in of PL spectra at pressure ranging from 4.5 to 7.6 GPa. arb. units, arbitrary units. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Raman spectra excited by 1.96-eV (633-nm) laser (when emission is green) and 2.33-eV (532-nm) laser (when emission is red). (
   <bold>D</bold>) trPL spectra. The smooth lines are biexponential decay fittings of the raw decay data.
