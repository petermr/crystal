<p>The agreement between the calculated modulation functions and amplified refined modulation functions is excellent for the displacive modulation of 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> of the 
 <italic>T</italic> site and O1, but in turn the agreement is worse for the respective modulations of 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>. The overall residual 
 <italic>R</italic> factor = 0.02 indicates that the calculations are in good agreement with experimental observations and that the method applied here allows one to establish and validate superspace models for comparison with or as reference for experimental observations.
