<p id="Par15">Next, we discuss possible explanations of the diagonal nematicity. Our results suggest that the diagonal nematicity is unlikely due to a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface, which prefers symmetry breaking along the bond direction

In addition, it is an interesting open question whether the loop-current order would explain the bond nematicity in bilayer cuprates such as YBCO. Recent resistivity measurements on tetragonal La
