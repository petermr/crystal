<p>The upgrade resulted in a net gain of counts by 40% between 2016 and 2017. The 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing range of data that can be accessed in a single measurement has also increased substantially. For example, in 2016 one could collect a 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing range from 0.3 to 5.2 Å using a center wavelength of 1.066 Å at 60 Hz; after the upgrade a center wavelength of 0.8 Å allows diffraction data collection in the range 0.135–8.2 Å. A longer counting time (compared with that needed for Rietveld refinement) to acquire requisite statistics in this 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing range (corresponding to a momentum transfer, 
 <italic>Q</italic>, range 0.7–47 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>) can also be used to carry out pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Prior to the upgrade it was necessary to perform two independent measurements with two different wavelength bands to achieve the required low and high 
 <italic>Q</italic> to generate total scattering data.
