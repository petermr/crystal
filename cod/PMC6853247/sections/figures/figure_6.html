 <caption> Experimental and simulated differential O K‐edge energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) spectra: Specimen degradation noted by a peak appearance of O 2 cluster development (grey arrow at 530.8 eV). The signature of the differential spectra is composed of four peaks (black arrows near 535, 537.5, 539.5, and 543 eV) whose intensities depend on the thickness analyzed zones. </caption>
