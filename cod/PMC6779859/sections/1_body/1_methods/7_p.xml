<p>The cartesian positions of the Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ions in the single crystal were determined by X-ray crystallography (Jenkins et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Since the single crystal used in the EPR experiments contains a number of Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ions comparable to an Avogadro's number, which is too large to be handled in a computer, we extract several spherical clusters with increasing radii of hundreds of Å from the single crystal. For each given pair of energy levels, we calculated γ
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> at each one of these clusters and found that, for a large enough radius, γ
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> converges to a limit value. This means that including additional Gd
 <sup>III</sup> ions beyond the converging cluster radius does not produce any effect on the calculated γ
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> anymore, and hence proves that there is no need to deal with the whole single crystal. A radius of 400 Å was enough to converge the calculated γ
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> in each pair of energy levels explored.
