<p>Micrographs were obtained in a JEOL JSM 5910LV microscope, (JEOL company Akishima, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a secondary electron (SEI) detector operated at 15 kV in high-vacuum mode. For this analysis, around 3.0 mg of the synthesized material was placed onto a carbon ribbon, and then a thin layer of gold was deposited onto the surface of the sample by a sputter coating technique.</p>
