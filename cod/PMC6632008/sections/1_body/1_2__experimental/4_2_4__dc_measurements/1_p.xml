<p>The electrical conductivity was measured in the temperature range between 20 and 850 Â°C, using the 
 <italic>dc</italic> four-probe technique in bar-shaped pellets under 
 <italic>dc</italic> currents between 0.01 and 0.5 A. The currents were applied and collected using a Potentiostat-Galvanostat AUTOLAB PGSTAT 302 from ECO CHEMIE (NorECs Norwegian Electro Ceramics AS, Oslo, Norway).
