<p>On the basis of the Frobenius theorem, the correspondence between the layer irreps at the Γ point and the bulk irreps is given in Table 3
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3"> ▸</xref>. It is seen that each layer mode generates a pair of bulk modes at the Γ point, one odd and one even. The splitting is due to a weak van der Waals interaction between the layers. Therefore, the frequencies of the modes constituting a pair would be close.
