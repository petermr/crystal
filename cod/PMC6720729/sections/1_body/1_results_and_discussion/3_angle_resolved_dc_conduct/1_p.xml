<p>As mentioned above, 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> has a distorted orthorhombic crystal structure, which is distinctly anisotropic. According to standard mobility theory, the intrinsic mobility may be influenced by anisotropic acoustic phonon scatter and elliptic elastic constants (both are relevant to the anisotropic crystalline structure) [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. One of the consequences of an anisotropic carrier mobility is the anisotropic resistance. Therefore, we also performed angle-resolved DC conductance measurements on the 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake. In detail, first we mechanically exfoliated a few-layer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) flake onto a cleaned Si/SiO
 <sub>2</sub> (400 μm/285 nm) substrate with pre-fabricated metal pads (20 nm Gr/180nm Au), then the same process was conducted to transfer a 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake onto a h-BN film under an optical microscope. This was followed by e-beam lithography and lift-off processing, where 12 electrodes (20 nm Gr/40 nm Au) were fabricated on the same 1T’-WTe
 <sub>2</sub> flake spaced at an angle of 30° along a chosen reference direction (0°) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. Two strategies were taken to ensure consistent contact resistance: 1) samples with uniform thickness were selected for device fabrication under the microscope; 2) a constant angular velocity (10 rpm) was kept when we evaporated electrodes onto the samples.
