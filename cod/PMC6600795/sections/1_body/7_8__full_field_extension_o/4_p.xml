 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f011">Figure 11</xref>, the black dots represent the two extra rows of atoms. The next row of atoms that follows the end of the dislocation rows shows a bright area where the position of the atoms is not well defined. The blue area that follows this row outlines a region where the light intensities indicate a cavity, area where there is not a discernible atomic structure. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f012">Figure 12</xref>a summarizes the preceding analysis; the yellow dots correspond to atoms that are under compression, the parameters

 <sub>i</sub> are reduced. The region including green circles is under tension as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f009">Figure 9</xref>a: parameters
