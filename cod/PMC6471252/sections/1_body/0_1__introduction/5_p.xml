<p>One way to gain control over intermolecular distances in a crystal is the application of hydrostatic pressure. Studying rearrangements occurring in the crystal structures under pressure can also be the means of ascertaining the importance and relative hierarchy of intermolecular interactions [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Structural analysis at high pressure can therefore help explain the physicochemical properties of materials thus analyzed, as presented, e.g., in the review works by Parsons [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In particular, a constricted crystalline environment may effectively mimic the presence of certain aggregates, which under standard conditions would be extremely short-lived and therefore hard to trace.
