<p>The small-rotation angle (SA) ISAR images usually lose some target information due to the anisotropic scattering. To obtain high-quality InISAR images, reflected signal with a relative large range of rotation angle are needed. In large-rotation angle (LA) ISAR imaging, the RD algorithm is no longer applied, and convolutional back-projection (CBP) algorithm is adapt [
