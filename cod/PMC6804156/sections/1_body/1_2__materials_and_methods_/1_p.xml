<p>A series of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Bi(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>):Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> samples of (where Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration was 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% with respect to Bi
 <sup>3+</sup>) was synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The reagents, namely, MoO
 <sub>3</sub> (99+%), Rb
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (99+%) and Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.9%) were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium); Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.99%) was purchased from Tailorlux (Münster, Germany), and NH
 <sub>4</sub>H
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> (99%) was purchased from Reachem Slovakia, (Bratislava, Slovakia). These reagents were weighed and mixed in stoichiometric amounts (accurate weight of reagents are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-03275">Table S1</xref>). The powders were homogenized in an agate mortar with small amount of acetone as a grinding media. The mixture of reagents was poured to the porcelain crucible and sintered at 600 °C for 12 h in air three times with intermediate grinding of the product.
