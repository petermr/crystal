 </sup>. The structure of Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb first resolved in the pioneering study by Jack and Wachtel
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> is characterised by 8 sites occupied by an equal number of Cs atoms and by additional 8 sites with random Cs and Sb occupations. In our first-principles calculations we consider an idealised FCC crystal structure for stiochiometric Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb, Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb, and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>) also adopted in previous theoretical studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. In this FCC lattice, the Sb atoms are located at the origin of the unit cell with Wycoff coordinates (0,0,0), while the alkali species are found at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and ±(1/4, 1/4, 1/4). We denote these sites as A
 <sub>2</sub>, A
 <sub>1</sub>, and A
 <sub>3</sub>, respectively, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. From a crystallographic viewpoint, A
 <sub>1</sub> and A
 <sub>3</sub> represent equivalent sites. In Cs
 <sub>3</sub>Sb, where all these positions are occupied by Cs atoms, there are two inequivalent Cs atoms in the unit cell. We consider Cs
 <sub>2</sub>KSb and CsK
 <sub>2</sub>Sb structures such that the two alkali species occupy inequivalent sites, as visualised in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>.
