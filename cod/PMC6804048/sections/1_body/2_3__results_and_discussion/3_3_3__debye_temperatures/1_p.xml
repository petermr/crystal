<p>The resultant phonon DOSs were also used to calculate the Debye temperature. It should be noted that it is considered more difficult to obtain accurate values using this approach than through the elastic constants (see above), because as a low temperature property, the Debye temperature is determined by low energy phonons; i.e., the acoustic phonons. The lower the temperature, the smaller the part of Brillouin Zone that contributes to thermodynamics. The calculated values (
