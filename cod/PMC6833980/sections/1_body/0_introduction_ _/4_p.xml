<p>If a perfect crystal is bent with negative strain gradient (β &lt; 0), the trajectory of the refracted beam shows a hyperbolic form opening down and the beam always reaches the back surface as shown in Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>a</italic>). Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>c</italic>) shows that the tie points corresponding to the refracted beam 
 <bold>S</bold>′
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <bold>S</bold>′
 <sub>2</sub> move on the dispersion surface in the range indicated by red lines. IFRB can be observed between two beams, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> one (
 <bold>S</bold>′
 <sub>2</sub>) reflected once from the back surface and the other (
 <bold>S</bold>′′
 <sub>4</sub>) reflected twice from the back surface in Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>b</italic>). γ is the angle of the refracted beam from the surface at the incident point. Similar interference fringes can be observed between two beams 
 <italic>n</italic> and 
 <italic>n</italic> + 1 (
 <italic>n</italic> is a positive integer) times reflected from the back surface. IFTB also can be observed for β &lt; 0.
