 <sub class="sub">C</sub>. The fact that LNMR occurs in all current and field configurations with small anisotropy for both 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.34 and 0.41 indicates that it is not related to dimensional confinement nor orbital nature in our system. Similar behavior was observed in Be-doped AlGaAs – GaAs quantum well structures, in which the LNMR is attributed to spin exchange interactions between localized states

 <italic class="italic">ab</italic>-) plane and continuous increase of magnetization (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). However, this scenario cannot explain the increased LNMR with increasing 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>, as energy gap is enlarged and spin polarization becomes weaker. Theoretically, MR in doped ferromagnetic semiconductors is expected to be inversely proportional to the number of charge carriers per magnetic unit cell
