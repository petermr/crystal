<p>In order to accelerate the migration rate of electrons in TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, inhibit the recombination of the electron and hole, improve the photoresponse range of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was modified by the in-situ doping of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions by precipitation at 800 rpm in IS-RPB. The catalyst was characterized after being calcinated at 500 Â°C.
