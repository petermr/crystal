 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the Z-density profiles of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer of montmorillonites with different charge density. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the charge density has a significant influence on the distribution of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. With the increases in layer charge density, the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> appears to be gradually shift from the vicinity of the central axis to the Si-O surface on both sides in the montmorillonite layer, and this phenomenon is more obvious when the layer charge of montmorillonite is higher (such as M3, M4). The reason is that the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> between the layers of montmorillonite are subjected to electrostatic attraction of negative charges on the layers, causing the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to diffuse to the Si-O surface. Since the montmorillonite with higher charge density has a large number of negative potential points, the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the interlayer are subjected to stronger electrostatic force; therefore, the diffusion of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to the Si-O surface is more obvious. In general, the Z-density distribution of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is similar to that of water molecules and H
 <sub>w</sub> in water molecules.
