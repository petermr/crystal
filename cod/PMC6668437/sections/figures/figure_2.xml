  <p>Experimental electronic structure of EuMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> and YbMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> and evidence for canting. 
   <bold>a</bold> Fermi surface map of EuMnBi
   <sub>2</sub>. White arrows with numbers indicate the directions along which the spectra in the panels to the right have been recorded. Data are taken using 27 eV photons (cut #1 at 44 eV). No Dirac crossings are seen in this case. 
   <bold>b</bold> Same as (
   <bold>a</bold>), but for YbMnBi
   <sub>2</sub>. Zero momentum in panel with the cut #2 (
   <italic>hν</italic> = 80 eV) corresponds to the BZ center. Dashed lines in the panel with cut #3 are guides to eye representing splitting of the degenerate bands due to TRS breaking. Crossings of these bands near the Fermi level are Weyl points. 
   <bold>c</bold> Magneto-optical images of the YbMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> (left) and EuMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> (right) crystals, observed under conditions of the Voigt effect at perpendicular light incidence. A domain contrast can only be seen on the YbMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> material, proving the presence and the absence of magnetic moment canting in YbMnBi
   <sub>2</sub> and EuMnBi
   <sub>2</sub>, respectively (see text). 
   <bold>d</bold> Schematic results of the band-structure calculations taking into account the canting (10°) resulting in an in-plane ferromagnetic component along the (1,1,0) direction. 
   <italic>k</italic>
   <sub>x*</sub> and 
   <italic>k</italic>
   <sub>y*</sub> are the directions perpendicular to and along the Fermi surface contour, respectively
