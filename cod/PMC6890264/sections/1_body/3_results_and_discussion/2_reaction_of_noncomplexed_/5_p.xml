<p>Although the NCs react with a strong Lewis acid, they do not dissolve completely, even after 300 min (

Interestingly, in micrographs obtained using HAADF-STEM, most particles exhibit a uniform contrast after reacting for 300 min (

This uniform contrast indicates that the previously formed cavities are filled with new material. EDS elemental maps show that this material consists mostly of gallium. These observations suggest that Ga-containing monomers, formed upon extraction of S

 <sub>3</sub>, precipitate inside the NC cavities after longer reaction times. This refilling of the cavities likely blocks further reactions on the NC surface, preventing further dissolution.
