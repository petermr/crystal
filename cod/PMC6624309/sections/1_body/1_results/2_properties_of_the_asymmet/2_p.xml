 </sup>, the acoustic waves incident from the left and right sides, possess the same transmission spectrum but different reflection spectra. Next, we have calculated the transmission and reflection coefficients of left-incident and right-incident elastic waves that propagate through the 2D 
 <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric PCs. As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref>, the left reflection is different from the right one, and their strengths are much higher because of the gain and loss medium. High reflections and high transmissions occur at the frequencies of approximately 0.26 and 0.75, which show a great coincidence with the frequency of marked degenerated points 1 and 2 at the Γ-X direction in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d)</xref>. The transmissions here are much higher than 1. Although the left and right reflection coefficients have different values, the overall trend is roughly identical except for the frequency region indicated in gray in which we are interested. In the marked region, two reflection peaks are distinctly interlaced, which corresponds to different unidirectional zero reflections in the frequency domain and simultaneously results in the obvious asymmetric response in this frequency range.
