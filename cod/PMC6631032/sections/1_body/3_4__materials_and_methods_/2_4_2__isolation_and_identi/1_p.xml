<p>Water samples were collected from 52 
 <italic>Microcystis</italic> sp. surface scums at various sites in Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel, during a bloom event in February 2014. Aliquots of 100 µL were placed on 1.5% agar petri dishes containing Luria–Bertani (LB) medium and incubated at 30 °C. Single colonies were isolated and sub-cultured by streaking onto solid or into liquid LB; the latter were agitated (100 rpm) at 30 °C. Those isolates that were able to grow on polysaccharides isolated from 
 <italic>Microcystis</italic> sp. were identified using their 16S rDNA sequences. DNA was isolated from LB grown cultures using phenol and chloroform by a standard method [

 <xref rid="B16-metabolites-09-00110" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The forward (F) and reverse (R) primers used were: F-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG and R-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of strain A134 clearly indicated that the isolated bacterium was
