 <caption> XRD patterns where ( a) the unknown phase begins to appear, and ( b) the unknown phase grows after an isothermal hold. Inset of ( a): Amplified view of the low Q region, showing the peaks of the unknown phase. Black lines show the XRD pattern, while red lines show the Rietveld fitting of the XRD with ε-Al 60Sm 11 and fcc-Al. The vertical lines in magenta and cyan show the peak positions for ε-Al 60Sm 11 and Al, respectively. The navy diamonds indicate the diffraction peaks of the unknown phase. </caption>
