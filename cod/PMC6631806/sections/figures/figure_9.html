 <caption> Three-dimensional morphology of the network mesophase evolved from C(±Y) surface in a periodic box of 10 × 10 × 10 R G 3 . The unit cell morphology is depicted in plot ( a) by using Matlab in four different angles and its 1/8th piece is shown in plot ( b) by using Mesodyn just to reveal the tripod connections of the channels. A domain as the dispersed phase is only drawn here. </caption>
