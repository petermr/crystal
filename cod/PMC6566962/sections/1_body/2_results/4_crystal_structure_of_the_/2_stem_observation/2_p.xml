 <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> indicates that there are two domains with different arrangements of these bright spots as outlined by yellow dotted rectangles (Supplementary Figure S1). These two domains are obviously symmetric with each other with respect to the (001)

 <xref rid="S0003-S2002-S3001">Section 3.2.1</xref>. Surprisingly, the thickness of each twin variant is fairly constant when measured along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis of the orthorhombic unit cell of the parent η phase, being 7.5 times the orthorhombic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice constant (~3.16 nm) for this composition (Al-30.0 at.%Fe). Then, the total thickness of a pair of twin variants A and B is 15 times the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis lattice constant of the parent orthorhombic unit cell (M value
