<p>La, Ce, Pr, and Nd alanates were produced by metathesis that was assisted by mechanical milling of the corresponding trichlorides and NaAlH

 <xref rid="B261-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>]. The first step is associated with the decomposition of the alanate. Meanwhile, the second step can be associated with the decomposition of the corresponding metal hydride and the formation of M-Al alloys. Although the decomposition pathway was proposed for Nd, based on the in-situ X-ray diffraction data that were presented by Weidenthaler et al., the reaction can be extrapolated for Ce and Pr [
