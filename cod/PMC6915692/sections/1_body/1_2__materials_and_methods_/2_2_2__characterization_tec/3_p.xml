<p>Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments were performed from room temperature down to T = 5 K in order to identify the W5+ ions and/or the occurrence of free electrons in the conduction band of the tungsten trioxide semi-conductors. The presented EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at X-band frequency (9.45 GHz) with 1 mW microwave power, 0.5 mT magnetic field modulation amplitude (frequency 100 kHz) and a spectral resolution of 0.15 mT/pt.</p>
