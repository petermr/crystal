<p id="Par5">The emission energy distribution of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is generally related with the average bond lengths, coordination numbers and the symmetry of the cations and corresponding polyhedron occupied by Eu

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Many strategies, including neighboring-cation substitution, chemical unit cosubstitution and cation-size-mismatch have been used to tune visible photoluminescence of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. However, there is still a challenge to realize the NIR emission for the difficulties of obtaining strong crystal field splitting (CFS) and large centroid shift originating from Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. Recently, our group has reported a new approach showing that Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> selectively occupies a site with small coordination number, which tends to large redshift as found in Rb
 <sub>3</sub>YSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> with red emission
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. If the cationsâ€™ sites occupied by Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in Rb
 <sub>3</sub>YSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> are substituted by smaller ions, this effect will produce a larger CFS and even realize NIR emission. Accordingly, we have designed a Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doped K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> NIR phosphor from isostructural Rb
 <sub>3</sub>YSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> by substituting the large Rb
 <sup>+</sup> and Y
 <sup>3+</sup> ions with small K
 <sup>+</sup> and Lu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions to further increase the CFS effect
