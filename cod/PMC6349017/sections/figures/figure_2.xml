 <caption>
  <title>Snapshots from molecular dynamics simulations of (a) the ZnO(101[combining macron]0), and (b) the ZnO(112[combining macron]0) surface in contact with liquid water, illustrating the slab models used in this work. The simulations were performed under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. One periodic image for each system, with the given dimensions, is highlighted.</title>
