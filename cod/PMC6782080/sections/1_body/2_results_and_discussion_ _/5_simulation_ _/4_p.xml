<p>After verification with the experimental data, the designed structure models were compared with energy-minimizing computer calculations based on the work by Béré &amp; Serra (2003
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> ▸</xref>). For the twin defects presented here they calculated the energetically most favourable atomic boundary structures for GaN in its wurtzite-type structure using an empirical inter­atomic potential of the Stillinger–Weber type and the quench–molecular dynamic method. The formation energies for different atomic boundary structures have been discussed for both types of twin boundary. According to this work, a related atomic boundary structure for the

 </inline-formula> planes. This head-to-head junction possesses the highest calculated formation energy of ∼3.5 J m
 <sup>−2</sup> in GaN, which is about 0.8 J m
 <sup>−2</sup> larger than for boundary structures with a corrugated or head-to-tail interface. Furthermore, first-principles density-functional total-energy calculations by Yan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2005
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb55"> ▸</xref>) showed, in principle, that the same twin boundary structures are formed in ZnO as in wurtzite group III nitrides but with ∼1/3 of the GaN twin boundary energy. Hence, the above considerations can be expected to hold qualitatively true in ZnO and can explain the small number of these head-to-head

 </inline-formula> boundaries observed in the nanospikes, also acting as a structural feature in the growth process. Relaxed structure models of the latter congruent with the model presented here are reported in the literature (Ding &amp; Wang, 2009
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb11"> ▸</xref>; Shan 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
