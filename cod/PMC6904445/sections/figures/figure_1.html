 <caption> ( a) Detail of the conventional (gonio) XRD pattern of sample “GMO/STO(001)”, red) standard and blue) with 1.5° angular off-set for maximizing thin film reflections. Projection in the ( Θ , Ω ) space coordinates of the symmetric reciprocal space map centered at ( b) 2 Θ  = 46.47° and Ω = 23.23° and ( c) at 2 Θ  = 61.24° and Ω  = 18.09°. ( d) Symmetric pole figure obtained at 2Θ = 25.65° corresponding to the 4 reflections of GMO (111) planes. </caption>
