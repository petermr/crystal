<p id="Par13">Cross-section TEM micrographs through the centre of a nano-indent in the implanted material clearly show defect free zones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(d)</xref>), inspiring confidence in the proposed mechanism of defect removal by glide dislocations in localised areas. These slip channels are found to be parallel to the [111] direction and are cleared of most visible defects. This observation is similar to slip channels observed in other irradiated materials

 </sup>. In some cases, the experimentally observed slip channels appear clearly demarcated, with sharp boundaries separating the channels from the surrounding matrix

 </sup> and iron ion irradiated Fe-12Cr-20Mn (irradiated to a dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>16</sup> ions per cm
 <sup>2</sup>). In contrast, the slip channels we observe have a less well-defined boundary with the surrounding, higher defect density material. A similar observation of slip bands with diffuse boundaries with the surrounding matrix was made in 0.012 dpa neutron-irradiated bcc vanadium
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. In the case of vanadium, the diffuse boundary between the slip bands and the matrix, was caused by “weak channeling” i.e. a state close to the threshold dose for channeling, where there is sufficient defect density to initiate channeling, but where the channels are not completely defect free
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Accordingly, in vanadium exposed to higher damage levels of 0.12 and 0.69 dpa, the localised bands were found to become completely cleared of all defects, and more clearly demarcated from the surrounding matrix
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Similar observations of channels developing sharper, well defined boundaries with the surrounding matrix, with increasing dose, were seen in neutron irradiated pure iron (between 0.4 and 0.79 dpa)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> and in neutron-irradiated zircaloy-4 (between 0.1 and 0.8 dpa)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. These previous observations imply that the 3000 appm helium-implanted tungsten studied here may be at the threshold dose for initating channeling, leading to the observation of the weak, less well defined channels in Fig.
