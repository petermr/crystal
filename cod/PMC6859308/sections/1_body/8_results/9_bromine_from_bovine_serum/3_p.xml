<p>We analyzed 7 BrQ-treated and 9 BrQ-free parasites. In BrQ-treated parasites, we identify distinct areas of Br overlaying hemozoin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>). In BrQ-free parasites there is no such overlay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). However, the difference in overlay is not always as clear to the naked eye as shown in other examples given in

 </ext-link>. We have taken up this challenge by quantifying the extent of overlap of Br with hemozoin in BrQ-treated and BrQ-free parasites. This extent is given in form of an overlap parameter 
 <italic>O</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Br,Hz</italic>
 </sub>. When there is no overlap 
 <italic>O</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Br,Hz</italic>
 </sub> = 0. In case there is an overlap 
 <italic>O</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Br,Hz</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0. The overlap parameter for several BrQ-treated and BrQ-free parasites is plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>. The exact definition and calculation of the overlap parameter are presented in
