<p>Independent of the chosen dispersion correction, the crystal energy landscapes suggest that phenytoin is polymorphic and that at very low temperature 
 <bold>form I</bold> is not the most stable phase. The two ribbon chain motifs and the ladder motifs, as well as the two 2D packing motifs, are highly competitive with the 
 <bold>form I</bold> H-bonding motif. In fact, the ribbon chain 1 packing motif dominates the lowest energy crystal structures in both the PBE-TS and PBE-D2 lattice energy landscapes, with the lowest ribbon chain 1 motifs showing 2D packing similarity.
