<p>Precession electron diffraction tomography was carried out on a FEI® Tecnai G2 20 operated at 200 kV and equipped with a NanoMEGAS Digistar precession device and an ORIUS 832 Gatan charge‐coupled device camera with 14‐bit dynamic range. The diffraction patterns were obtained using a defocused parallel beam and a selected area aperture of about 250 nm in diameter, smaller than the width of the lamellae. The lamella has been orientated in the microscope in such a way that the goniometer tilt axis is kept perpendicular to the interface plane during the tilt experiments only for the lamella that contributed to the collected diffraction patterns series. The electron diffraction pattern tilt series were collected by varying the tilt angle from ‐45° to +45° with an acquisition step of 1° (91 patterns for one tilt series). The precession angle was set to 1.2°, slightly higher than the tilt step in order to ensure a full coverage of the reciprocal space within the tilt range. During the tilt series acquisition, the position of the aperture with respect to the lamellae was checked every few degrees.</p>
