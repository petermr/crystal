<p>In summary, we can mention that the electronic band structure and optical properties of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> with accurate first-principle calculations were investigated. The calculated HSE06 electronic structures confirmed that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> exhibits an indirect band gap, with a value of 1.109 eV, at the Z
 <sub>1</sub>-point. However, TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> also exhibits a direct band gap, with a value of 1.129 eV at the Z-point. The first absorption peak at a photon energy of 1.129 eV confirms this finding. Until now, numerical limitations in calculating the band gap energies in the range of a few meV difference have been leading to claims stating that the fundamental gap of TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> is indirect. Our accurate calculations from employing BSE revealed that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> possesses an additional direct band gap of 1.129 eV with a difference of 20 meV compared to the indirect band gap. Our comparison of the calculated absorption coefficient of silicon and TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> shows that TlGaTe
 <sub>2</sub> has a better absorption coefficient than silicon in the visible region.
