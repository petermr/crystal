<p>The trajectory of the X-ray refracted beam in a very weakly bent perfect crystal with negative strain gradient shows a hyperbolic form opening down, while it shows a hyperbolic form opening up when the strain gradient is positive. This difference in beam trajectory results in quite different X-ray interference fringes. The interference fringes for β &lt; 0 were mainly studied in the above. In the wave emitted from the entrance surface IFRB were observed between once- and twice-reflected beams from the back surface. In the transmitted wave from the back surface, IFTB were observed between the beam directly reaching the back surface and the beam once reflected from the entrance surface. These interference fringes for β &lt; 0 were compared with the corresponding interference fringes for β &gt; 0. IFRB and IFTB were analysed by using the dynamical theory of diffraction for a bent crystal. The results showed very good agreement between the observed and the calculated values of the interference fringe spacing, which enabled us to evaluate the strain gradient of the sample crystal. If a thinner crystal is used when
