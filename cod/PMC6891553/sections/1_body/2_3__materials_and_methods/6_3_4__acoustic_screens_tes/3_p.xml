<p>On the other hand, and as previously explained in the introduction section, sonic crystals can be defined as a heterogeneous material formed by arrays of acoustic scatterers embedded in air. These materials present several properties related to the control of acoustic waves [

Bandgaps are frequency ranges where acoustic waves cannot be transmitted through sonic crystals, and their existence is due to Braggâ€™s law [

 <xref rid="B44-sensors-19-04881" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Their size and position in the frequency domain depends on the geometric parameters of the sonic crystals, such as (i) the kind of crystalline array in which the scatterers are arranged, (ii) the distance between them (generally known as the lattice constant), or (iii) the surface area of the scatterers per surface unit of the crystalline lattice (called filling factor). This fact implies that, while classical ABs work to attenuate a wide part of the frequency spectrum, SCASs act as a filter, attenuating a specific and limited frequency range. The different way of working of both kinds of ABs (classical and SCAS) makes it very difficult to carry out a quantitative study on how the movement of sand in the bases of the ABs influences the acoustic attenuation achieved, since this attenuation is not comparable in any case.
