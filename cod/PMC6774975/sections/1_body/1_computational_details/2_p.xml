<p>By using the pseudo-potential plane-wave method based on density functional theory, we have performed the first-principles calculation [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] to study the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the full Heusler compounds Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and the ultrasoft pseudo potential [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] are selected to describe the exchange-correlation potential and the interaction between the atomic core and the valence electrons. After initial convergence test, a plane-wave cut-off energy of 500 eV and a specific 
 <italic>k</italic>-point mesh using a 15 × 15 × 15 Monkhorst-Pack grid were applied for all calculations. The self-consistent field tolerance was set as a total energy difference smaller than 1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> eV atom
