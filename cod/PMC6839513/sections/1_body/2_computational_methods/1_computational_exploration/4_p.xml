<p>To see the effects of minor changes in the molecular conformation, all structures within 23 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup> of the rigid body global minimum were further refined by simultaneous relaxation of the “flexible” internal degrees of freedom of the molecules (as defined in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>) and the crystal structure. This was done by minimizing the lattice energy (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>latt</sub>), calculated as the sum of the intermolecular contribution (
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>inter</sub>) and the conformational energy penalty paid for the distortion of the molecular geometry to improve the hydrogen bonding geometries. For each conformation considered in the minimization of 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>latt</sub>, conformational energy penalties (taken as Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>intra</sub>, with respect to the pyramidal global conformational energy minimum) and isolated molecule charge densities were computed at the PBE0/6-31G(d,p) level. Overall, 278 structures were minimized using the CrystalOptimizer database method.
