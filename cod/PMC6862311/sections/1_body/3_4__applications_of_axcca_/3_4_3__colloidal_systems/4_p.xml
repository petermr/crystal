<p>In some cases of nearly crystalline structures, it is viable to consider the initial angular CCF rather than its Fourier components. The colloidal crystals made of poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) hard-spheres of 125.5 nm in diameter were studied in [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f013">Figure 13</xref>, well distinguishable peaks of the angular CCF measured at four different

 <sup>3</sup> perfect crystals in random orientations were modeled for monodisperse particles of the same size and volume fraction as the sample system in the experiment, and the CCFs at the same 
 <italic>q</italic>-values were calculated for each diffraction pattern and averaged. A comparison between the experimental and model data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03464-f013">Figure 13</xref>) has revealed that the structure of the real colloidal crystals is more likely to be fcc with indications of stacking faults. We should note here that in this case the standard analysis of the measured angular averaged structure factor of the colloidal crystal
