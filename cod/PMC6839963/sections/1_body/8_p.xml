<p id="P10">The cluster composition plays an important role in the overall energy distribution. Since the Sc–N–Sc angle is close to 2π/3, stable 
 <bold>COS-0</bold> conformers can also be obtained for 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 2π/3 (in this case another Sc atom has a vertical orientation). Indeed, clustering of low-energy conformers can be seen near 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 2π/3. In total, the energy distribution of the 
 <bold>COS-0</bold> conformers is very dense, giving only a moderate ordering effect for the energy cut-off of 1
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>B</sub>
 <italic>T</italic> at room temperature. For the YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N cluster in the 
 <bold>COS-1</bold> system, the situation is different. The conformer with 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 0 corresponds to the well-defined global minimum. If the positions of Y and one Sc atom are flipped (giving 
 <italic>Θ</italic> = 2π/3), the energies increase by 
 <italic>ca.</italic> 5 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Thus, the ordering effect for YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) is more pronounced and gives essentially one structure for the energy cut-off of Δ
 <italic>E</italic> = 2.5 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>.
