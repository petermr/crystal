 <sub>2</sub>O (atomic coordinates listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table

 </xref>). It can be clearly seen that after exposure to H
 <sub>2</sub>O practically all atoms in the selvedge appear to have bulk-like displacements, a phenomenon not uncommon to metal oxide surfaces.

 </sup> This is especially the case for the surface layer [atoms O(1) and Ti(1)] and explains why the asymmetrical line shape in the anti-Bragg regions of the CTRs for TiO
