<p>In order to validate the proposed mechanisms of action of antimalarial quinoline drugs we raised the following questions. What is the concentration of the drug in the digestive vacuole of the parasite? Does the drug indeed bind to the hemozoin crystal faces and persist at these crystal surfaces in vivo? If so, would the crystal surface coverage by the drug be sufficient to inhibit regular heme dimer adsorption onto the crystal faces? Finally, can we detect or envisage binding of the drug to free heme?</p>
