<p>(i) Each nanometric particle constituting the blue and black samples exhibits a gradient of unit-cell parameters. It could be reasonnably considered that this unit-cell parameter gradient is created from surface proximity. Indeed, it was demonstrated in a previous work on ZnO nanoparticles synthetized by polyol route that the crystallites exhibit a unit-cell gradient from the surface to the bulk [
