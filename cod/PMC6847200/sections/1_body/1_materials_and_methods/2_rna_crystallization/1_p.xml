<p>The 
 <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG aptamer domain RNA was crystallized at 30°C using the hanging drop diffusion method. 4 μl drops composed of a 1:1 ratio of RNA-ligand mixture to precipitant mixture were suspended above 500 μl of 35% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). The RNA-ligand mixture contained 300 μM RNA and 600 μM 2′-deoxyguanosine while the precipitant mixture contained 40 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.0, 23% v/v MPD, 18 mM cobalt hexammine, 80 mM potassium chloride, and 12 mM sodium chloride. Hanging drops were incubated for 2–3 days to allow crystals to reach maximum size. To cryoprotect, crystals were soaked in a precipitant mixture containing 35% MPD for 5 min, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on a home-source Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF X-ray source with a Dectris Pilatus 3R 200K-A detector and processed with HKL3000. Screening for crystals that diffract X-rays to high resolution and data collection methods were using standard practice for X-ray crystallography (
