<p id="Par6">The Hall coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>) at RT were measured by using a PPMS (Model-9) with a magnetic field sweeping between ± 5.0 T. The Hall mobility (
 <italic>μ</italic>) and carrier concentration (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>) were subsequently determined based on the equations 
 <italic>μ</italic> = |
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>|
 <italic>σ</italic> and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> = 1/(e
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>H</sub>), respectively (
 <italic>e</italic> is the electron charge).
