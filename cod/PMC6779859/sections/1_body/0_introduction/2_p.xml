<p>As far as this spatial organization is concerned, molecular spin qubits (MSQ) are especially promising (Ding et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gaita-Ariño et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These qubits are encoded in the spin energy levels of magnetic coordination compounds, which commonly consist of a single magnetic metal ion coordinated by a set of ligands. It is precisely because of the versatility offered by synthetic chemistry what confers upon these MSQs the important property of being tailored at will with the desired features. There already exist some proposals of spatial organization based on (i) binding-tag biomolecules, where the spin qubits are communicated via magnetic dipolar interaction (Gaita-Ariño et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Rosaleny et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and (ii) templated 2D arrays where the exchange of information between the qubits is mediated by a net of waveguides (Jenkins et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
