 <caption> ( a) Data collected at various different center wavelengths for CsLaNb 2O 7, showing the difference in data range, resolution and intensity as described in Table 1 ▸ for 60 Hz data only. Shorter wavelengths provide information at much shorter d spacing (higher Q). ( b) Selected region of the data showing that the longer wavelengths provide better resolution and statistics. ( c)–( e) Rietveld refinement of LaB 6 (SRM 660b) using center wavelengths of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.665 Å in the high-resolution mode. The light-blue dots are the observed intensity, the navy-blue line is the calculated intensity, and also shown are the difference plot and tick markers. The values of full width at half-maximum reported in Fig. 6 ▸ are obtained from these fits. The overall goodness parameters for all three histograms are R wp = 6.84% and χ 2 = 4.48. </caption>
