<p>Therefore, the discussion of the IR bands will be based on harmonic periodic system calculations. The neglecting of anharmonicity in the case of periodic system calculations did not decrease noticeably the agreement with the experimental spectrum. We have carried out two separate calculations of IR spectra for the lattice model (B3LYP/Gatti and B3LYP/TZVP; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01402">Figures S2 and S3 in Supplementary Materials</xref>). The differences between these two simulated spectra are qualitatively negligible, with the exception of the low-lying bands in the region of 900–650 cm

Accordingly, the overhead computing cost that is introduced by the larger TZVP basis set did not return any profit in the case of melamine. The accuracy of scaled B3LYP/Gatti allows for unambiguous band assignments in the entire 4000–650 cm
