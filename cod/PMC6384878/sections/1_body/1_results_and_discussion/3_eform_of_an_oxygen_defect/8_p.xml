<p id="Par19">In summary, we investigated the oxygen-ion conduction mechanism in the Ca
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>Ge
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> garnet-type oxide by the first-principles calculations. Ca
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>Ge
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> exhibited a low 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>mig</italic>
 </sub> of O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> of 0.45 eV with the kick-out mechanism. The migration path with this low 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>mig</italic>
 </sub> was delocalized and connected to the neighboring cells in three-dimensional space. In addition, this value was lower than that of 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O</sub> of 0.76 eV. However, this oxide had a shallow range of 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Fermi</italic>
 </sub> just below the LUMO to form O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> at a practical 
 <italic>T</italic> of 1000 K. This implies that high concentrations of extrinsic dopants, which may act as electron donors, are needed. Therefore, we expect that processing at a low 
 <italic>T</italic> and band-gap engineering to achieve a larger band-gap and thus generate stable O
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> are needed to achieve and improve 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>O</sub> of this oxide.
