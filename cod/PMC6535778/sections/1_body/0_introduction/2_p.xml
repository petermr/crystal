<p>Located at the Zintl border in the periodic table, the element Sn has moderate electronegativity, thus allowing it to participate in various types of bonding interactions. This provides flexibility in tuning the electronic properties of materials in which the electronic states of tin are dominant.

 </sup> Tin may be the critical elemental constituent in the topological crystalline insulator SnTe, for example, and the fabrication of Stanene thin films has been accomplished with the goal of establishing its topological electronic properties.
