 <caption> Annulene skeleton at the experimental symmetries: C 2 v very close to the configuration at ambient pressure (top left) and one of the C s subsymmetry close to the molecule in the crystal at high pressure (top right). DORI basins of each Câ€“C bond are color-coded to represent the relative percentage of the electron density integrals (DORI int) within the basins (relative to the maximum found) at ambient (bottom left) and high pressure (bottom right). All integral values (DORI int) and volumes of the basins (DORI vol) are given in the Supporting Information. </caption>
