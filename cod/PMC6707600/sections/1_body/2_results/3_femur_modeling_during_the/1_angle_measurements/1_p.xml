<p>Fetal samples were grouped into eight according to OSL with 5-mm intervals. CRL linearly increased according to OSL groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). ∠FNA decreased from a median of 23.0° before ossification to a median of -4.8° in fetuses with an OSL of 5–10 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The angle increased, reaching a median of 24.9° in fetuses with an OSL of &gt;30 mm. The median ∠FNS was 140.8° before ossification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), and the distribution of median ∠FNS was relatively constant (a median of 130°) in all fetuses after ossification. Variation was prominent among fetuses before ossification (range: 121.9–146.7°). ∠OBS increased from 3.5° before ossification to a median of 9.1° in fetuses with an OSL of 0–5 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The angle decreased to a median of 3.1° in fetuses with an OSL of 25–30 mm, which finally reached to a median of 4.4° in fetuses with an OSL of &gt;30 mm. Bilateral differences in ∠FNA, ∠FNS, and ∠OBS, which were examined using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, were not observed in all fetuses (p = 0.98, 0.28, and 0.76 for ∠FNA, ∠FNS, and ∠OBS, respectively).
