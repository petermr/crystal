 </sup>. This happens relatively easily, in a moderate pressure range of ∼10 – 30 GPa, as far as within the close-packed oxygen arrays there are only tetrahedral and octahedral interstices, which can be occupied by the cations without severe distortions of the framework. Pressurization of coesite leads to a different result, because its structure does not provide an easy way for the formation of a total hcp framework of oxygen atoms. Although in coesite-IV and coesite-V, one can see fragments closely resembling connections of octahedra in close-packed structures

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), these fragments do not form continuous layers, and silicon may locate in five-coordinated sites. This picture qualitatively agrees with the changes observed upon the transition from coesite-IV to coesite-V (Fig.

 </sup> that silica and silicate structures are based on close-packing due to a relatively high ionicity of the Si–O bond. One could hypothesize that the appearance of an unusual structural element (penta-coordinated silicon, octahedra sharing faces) may be related to increased covalency of Si–O bonding with pressure. However, Bader analysis of charge variation in different silica phases with pressure (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) shows that this is not the case. Our results suggest that penta-coordinated silicon may be a usual component of the intermediate structures or metastable phases upon compression of silicates with oxygen arrays significantly deviated from close-packing (e.g., tectosilicates with large cations, borosilicates, and others).
