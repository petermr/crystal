<p id="Par12">Partial metal–oxygen PDFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) calculated from the refined atomic coordinates confirm that both Pb and Nb are off-centered within the respective oxygen coordination polyhedra (cuboctahedra for Pb and octahedra for Nb), while Mg remains approximately central. The double-peak Pb–Mg and single-peak Pb–Nb distributions indicate much stronger off-centering of Pb relative to its Mg neighbors as compared with Nb, which is in line with the recent inferences from quantitative STEM imaging

 </sup>. On average, all the cations retain their ideal cubic positions. Locally, however, both Pb and Nb atoms are displaced preferentially along the 〈111〉 directions, and this preference becomes more pronounced on cooling from 300 K to 200 K (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b;</xref> Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>); the displacements of Mg appear to be isotropic. The probability density distribution (PDD) of Pb features eight well-separated 〈111〉 maxima (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) with the Pb atoms offset by ≈0.3 Å from the ideal cubic position. In contrast, the PDDs of Nb and Mg appear as a single peak. The Nb PDD exhibits a flattened top, which suggests either a flat potential well or an unresolved Nb-site splitting, whereas the Mg distribution is Gaussian. The root-mean-square displacements of Nb and Mg are ≈0.19 Å and ≈0.11 Å, respectively.
