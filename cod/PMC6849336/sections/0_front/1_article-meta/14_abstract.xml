 <p>Cesium lead halide nanocrystals (CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> NCs) are new inorganic light sources covering the entire visible spectral range and exhibiting near-unity efficiencies. While the last years have seen rapid progress in green and red electroluminescence from CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> NCs, the development of blue counterparts remained rather stagnant. Controlling the surface state of CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> NCs had proven to be a major factor governing the efficiency of the charge injection and for diminishing the density of traps. Although didodecyldimethylammonium halides (DDAX; X = Br, Cl) had been known to improve the luminescence of CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> NCs when applied postsynthetically, they had not been used as the sole long-chain ammonium ligand directly in the synthesis of these NCs. Herein we report a facile, direct synthesis of DDAX-stabilized CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> NCs. We then demonstrate blue and green light-emitting diodes, characterized by the electroluminescence at 463â€“515 nm and external quantum efficiencies of 9.80% for green, 4.96% for sky-blue, and 1.03% for deep-blue spectral regions.
