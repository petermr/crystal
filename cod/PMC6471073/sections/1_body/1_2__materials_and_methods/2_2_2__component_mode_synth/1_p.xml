They can be classified as fixed-interface methods, free-interface methods, and hybrid methods, depending upon whether the mode shapes used to define substructure coordinates are obtained with the interface coordinates fixed, free, or a combination of them. Normally, the fixed-interface methods can produce a better accuracy; however it is more complex than the free-interface methods. So in this paper, the free-interface method is used.
