  <bold>Funding:</bold> This research was supported in part by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies (FLEET), project no. CE170100039, funded by the Australian Government. This work was performed in part using facilities of the NSW Nodes of the Australian National Fabrication Facility. D.Z. acknowledges the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship. The research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln was supported by the National Science Foundation through the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (NSF grant no. DMR-1420645). 
  <bold>Author contributions:</bold> A.R.H. and F.-X.X. conceived the idea. This idea was developed further by P.S. and J.S. P.S. designed and implemented scanning probe microscopy measurements. F.-X.X. fabricated the WTe
  <sub>2</sub> samples and performed the electrical transport measurements. F.-X.X., D.Z., and P.S performed the XRD structural characterization. D.-F.S. and E.Y.T. conducted and/or analyzed the first-principles DFT calculations. D.Z., P.S., and J.S. collected and/or analyzed the ellipsometry data. P.S. and F.-X.X. wrote the manuscript with input from J.S. and A.R.H. All authors reviewed and contributed to the manuscript preparation.
