<p id="Par19">The starting material for the coesite synthesis was SiO
 <sub>2</sub> glass powder with very low trace-element content, as analyzed at the BGI using LA-ICP-MS: Al 20 ppm, Ge 1.3 ppm, Na 1.0 ppm, Li 0.8 ppm, and B, Ti, Fe, Ga, Rb, and Sn below the detection limits. Coesite single crystals were synthesized by mixing the starting powder with ~5 wt% distilled water inside a platinum capsule, which was then welded shut. The capsule was first placed into pyrophyllite sleeves and then in a 0.5′′ talc-pyrex piston-cylinder assembly containing internal, tapered graphite resistance furnaces. The mixture was pressurized to 3.5 GPa and slowly heated up to 1250 °C, kept at this temperature for ~15 h, then cooled down to 1100 °C in 5 h, and finally quenched. Slow cooling procedure and water-saturated conditions resulted in growth of relatively large (above 100 μm in linear dimensions) crystals. No Raman peaks were observed in the spectra of synthesized coesite in the O–H vibration region (2800–3400 cm
