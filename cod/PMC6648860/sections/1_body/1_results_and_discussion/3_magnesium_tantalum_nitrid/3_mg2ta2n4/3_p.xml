<p>When subjected to oxidation using an electrochemical potential spectroscopy (EPS) protocol at 100 °C in Li three-electrode cells in 1 
 <italic>m</italic> LiBOB, EC/PC 1:1 vol electrolyte, the electrodes containing Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Ta
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> exhibited a potential profile displaying a plateau around 4.2 V versus Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li and specific capacities close to 90 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> corresponding to Δ
 <italic>x</italic> of virtually de-inserted Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> of about 0.7 mol. However, no significant change in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern was observed, neither after electrochemical nor after chemical oxidation, which points at the amount of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> deintercalated being insignificant, if any, and the electrochemical capacity observed being again related to side reactions. Attempts to electrochemically reduce Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Ta
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> in Mg cell were not successful either.
