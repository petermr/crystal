<p id="p0025">The aforementioned quantum transitions in molecular and chemical physics (molecular quantum transitions), strictly speaking, are not quantum transitions, but quantum-classical transitions, since although their initial and final states are quantum, their transient states are of a classical nature. The quantum nature of the initial and final states is manifested in the fact that these states are often described by quantum mechanics in the adiabatic approximation and as a result of the reorganization of the nuclear subsystem, the structure of the final state of the molecular system differs markedly from the structure of its initial state. The latter fact is particularly evident for chemical reactions, which result in the formation of new molecules. The classical nature of the transient state of molecular systems is associated with the presence of chaos (dozy chaos) in the motion of electrons and nuclei involved in the quantum-classical transition, which leads to a continuous spectrum of their energies in this transient state [

The aforementioned dozy-chaos theory of elementary electron-charge transfers in condensed matter is the simplest problem in quantum-classical mechanics
