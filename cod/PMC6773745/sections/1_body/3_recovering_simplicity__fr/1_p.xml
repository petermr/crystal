<p id="Par9">Yet all this effort is predicated on one fundamental assumption: that by knowing the structure of a complex material, we will better understand its underlying physics. No doubt this is true, at least in part, for PMN. Its domainlike architecture does indeed help explain the unusual response to external electric fields, even if the physics that drive this particular structure remain opaque. But what if there had been no domains? Interpreting atomistic models for complex materials is its own particular challenge: my personal experience is that it can be very difficult to find the right order parameter to reveal hidden patterns

Meanwhile, in the parallel field of liquids and amorphous materials, it is increasingly clear that collective measures (such as density or mean-squared displacement) are often a better descriptor of properties than are atomic coordinates
