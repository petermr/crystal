<p id="Par30">X-ray single-crystal scattering measurements were performed at the beamline ID29 of ESRF. A rod-like 50-μm-thick crystal was mounted on a rotation stage and held in a cryostream flux for temperature control. Prior to the measurements, the sample was etched using hot concentrated hydrochloric acid. Diffuse-scattering patterns were recorded with the wavelength of 0.954 Å over the angular range of 360° in 0.1° increments on a single-photon counting pixel detector, which allowed for the shutter-less data collection. The CrysAlis software package was used to refine the orientation matrix and the final reciprocal-space reconstructions of 3D diffuse-intensity distributions were accomplished with locally developed computer software.</p>
