<p id="Par15">One can find from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> that the emission peaks shift to shorter wavelength (blueshift) at evaluated temperature from 300 to 500 K. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent PL spectra under excitation of 460 nm of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:0.01Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> were measured from 80 to 500 K, and the normalized spectra are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. The emission peaks demonstrate a remarkable blueshift from 790 nm (80 K) to 710 nm (500 K) with increasing temperature, and the FWHM of emission bands gradually broadens with the increase of temperature. These observations are associated with the different response of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions located at the Lu and K2 sites to the temperature. In addition, the emission peaks at high temperature (790 nm) and low temperature (710 nm) are close to the two Gaussian fitted peaks at room temperature (784 nm, 719 nm) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. This further validates the feasibility of the previous analysis about the site occupation of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions.
