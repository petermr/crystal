<p>We have calculated BECs for all of the compositions mentioned above. The diagonal components of the BECs for

 <sub>3</sub> are +2, +4, +4, and −2, respectively. But the diagonal components of the calculated BEC tensors for the atoms are much larger than their nominal ionic values. This reveals that there is large dynamic contribution superimposed to the static charge. This is due to the strong covalency effect, where a large amount of nonrigid delocalized charge flows across this compound during the ionic displacement. This results in additional charges with respect to the nominal ionic values (anomalous contribution), which are obtained at the atomic sites. A large BEC value at the oxygen site also suggests that a large force can be generated by applying a small field which can stabilize the polarized state. In an effort to shed light on the polarization of PbTi

 <sub>3</sub> for

 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. The calculated polarization values increase from 92 μC/cm
 <sup>2</sup> for pure PTO to 105, 110, 118, 130, 135, and 147 μC/cm
 <sup>2</sup> for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.75, and 1, respectively. This is due to the increase in tetragonal distortion with 
 <italic>x</italic> as discussed above. The polarization calculated with point charges showed comparatively low values. The reduction in polarization values using point charges indicates that the covalency effect plays an important role in deciding the polarization of these materials.
