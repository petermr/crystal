 <sub>2</sub>O; &gt;99%), and lithium hydroxide (LiOH; 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and used as-received without any further purification. Cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>, HB-4155H, Zhuhai HanboTrading Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China) was used as a yellow phosphor and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (SYLGARD 184 Kit, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) was used as the polymer matrix. The crystallographic properties of the crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD; X’Pert Pro, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), while their morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quanta 250, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs were obtained using an FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun microscope with a 0.19 nm point-to-point resolution at 200 keV equipped with an embedded Quantum Gatan Image Filter (Quantum GIF) for electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis. The images were analyzed via Gatan Digital Micrograph software. Optical characterization was carried out using an Ocean Optics spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB2000+, Duiven, The Netherlands).
