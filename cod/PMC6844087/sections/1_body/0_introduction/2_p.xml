<p>Spinel ferrites have a structure with the form MFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, where M is a divalent cation and typically a transition metal. Oxygen (O
 <sup>2â€“</sup>) ions form a face-centered cubic structure, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> cations occupy half of the octahedral holes (h
 <sub>O</sub>), and M
 <sup>2+</sup> ions are placed in eight of the tetrahedral holes (h
 <sub>T</sub>). In particular, copper ferrite (CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) has an inverse spinel structure, which has a different occupation of the vacancies: M
 <sup>2+</sup> cations are placed in h
 <sub>O</sub> with half of the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, whereas the other half are in h
 <sub>T</sub>.
