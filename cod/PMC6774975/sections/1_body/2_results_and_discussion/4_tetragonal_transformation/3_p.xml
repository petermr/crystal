<p>It is clearly seen that the tetragonal distortion can reduce the total energy for both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in either L2
 <sub>1</sub> or XA structure, which may lead to the phase transformation. As experimentally proved, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi prepared by arc-melting crystallizes in cubic structure [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and this is due to the L2
 <sub>1</sub>B disorder effect. Also, obtained elastic modulus constants from previous study [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] confirmed the mechanical stability for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in cubic structure. Thus, the possible tetragonal phase transformation is not caused by mechanical properties. Another comprehensive theoretical calculation from the energetic point of view shows that Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi has tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> ground state and attributes the reason to the density of states at the Fermi energy level [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This transformation is very interesting because not only the tetragonal structural distortion but also the atom site reordering occurs. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F6">figure 6</xref> at 100% volume, we can see that Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi at cubic condition (
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> = 1) has stable XA structure because of the low total energy, as discussed before, and, with the variation of 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> value, its total energy decreases much more strongly in tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> structure than in tetragonal XA structure to the minimum total energy when 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio is equal to 1.5, meaning the stable cubic XA structure could change into tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> structure with tetragonal distortion. This finding is consistent with previous study [
 <xref rid="RSOS191007C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. By varying the unit cell volume to 95% and 105%, an opposite effect is observed for the stable tetragonal distortion: the tetragonal XA structure has the lowest total energy at 95% volume, meaning that only tetragonal structural distortion is present without atom site reordering; while for 105% volume, the atom site ordering and tetragonal structural distortion have been enhanced because of the larger total energy difference.
