<p>Time-resolved PL (TRPL) was carried out to elucidate how the charge carrier dynamics of the pristine material changes with the introduction of Zn(II) and 3-CPACl. The samples were excited with a 485 nm pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 0.1 MHz. TRPL decay traces are fitted using a stretched monoexponential function

 <sub>i</sub> is the amplitude, τ
 <sub>1</sub> is the time constant, and β is the stretch factor ranging between 0 and 1. Our motivation to apply a stretched monoexponential function to these decays is that this model is appropriate to describe the decay in heterogeneous materials, showing monomolecular recombination distributions which have already been observed not only in spatially resolved PL works for MAPbI

 </sup> Such effects can be induced by differences in local material properties. Although the origin of these heterogeneities and their effects on charge dynamics are still unknown, this is beyond the scope of our work.
