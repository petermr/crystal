<p>KAlH
 <sub>4</sub> has an acceptable total hydrogen content of 5.75 wt.% and a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 4.3 wt.% (through reactions (34) and (35)). These values are comparable to NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> and, additionally, KAlH
 <sub>4</sub> does not need a catalyst to undergo re-hydrogenation at a hydrogen pressure as low as 10 bar [
 <xref rid="B161-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. KAlH
 <sub>4</sub> can be produced by direct synthesis in organic solvent from KH, Al, and hydrogen [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], or in powder form under high pressure of hydrogen (&gt;175 bar) and heating [
 <xref rid="B162-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], or by mechanical milling, followed by hydrogen exposure [
 <xref rid="B161-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], or by the reactive mechanical milling in hydrogen atmosphere [
 <xref rid="B163-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,
 <xref rid="B164-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>], or by the metathesis of NaAlH
 <sub>4</sub> or LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> with KCl promoted by ball milling [
 <xref rid="B165-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>].
