 </sup> Most of these methods ensure good results in terms of low particle size and morphology control, but, on the other hand, it is usually complex to have a precise control over the process, and the production rate is low. On the other hand, high-temperature solid-state methods are simple and easy to scale up. However, the degree of control that they have over the properties of the final material is poor. In this scenario, the sol–gel and gel combustion technique
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>−
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
 </sup> appears as a promising option due to its simplicity and control over the product characteristics. For this reason, different researchers have recently used this method in their work. For instance, López-Ramón et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
 </sup> and Zhuravlev et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
 </sup> showed the formation of both phases, tetragonal and cubic, depending on the synthesis conditions. The report from Masunga et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
 </sup> is a good summary of the work previously done in this field.
