 <p id="Par1">A previously unreported tetragonal phase has been discovered in a epitaxially strained GdMnO
  <sub>3</sub> thin films deposited on (001)-oriented SrTiO
  <sub>3</sub> substrates by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The tetragonal axis of the films grown up to a 35 nm thickness is perpendicular to the film surface and the basal lattice parameters are imposed by the cubic structure of the substrate. Furthermore, the emergence of a spontaneous electric polarization below ~32 K points to the stabilization of an improper ferroelectric phase at low temperatures, which is not observed in bulk GdMnO
  <sub>3</sub>. This work shows how strain engineering can be used to tailor the structure and properties of strongly correlated oxides.
