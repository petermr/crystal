<p id="Par9">Near the core region, we chose three O sites and three Mg sites to consider as the sites for an O or Mg vacancy, as highlighted in Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the resulting vacancy segregation energies to the dislocation core sites, or the energy differences of putting a single vacancy in the core region and putting the vacancy in the bulk-like region (far away from the dislocations). The segregation energies range from about −0.1 to −1.1 eV, depending on the site. It is interesting to see that the lowest energy sites are sites 3 for both O and Mg cases considering that they are slightly off the center of the core. We note that, for these segregation energies, the structure of the vacancy is still localized to the original ionic site; no dissociation has yet occurred.
