<p>We use near ultraviolet light or sunlight to irradiate BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> for some time. We can observe strong yellow persistent luminescence in a dark room after the removal of light source. The sample is irradiated under a 460 nm blue light source for 1 min. The persistent luminescence spectra were tested after removing the light source for 10 s, as shown in

 </xref>b. The persistent luminescence spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,
 <italic>x</italic>Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> is in accordance with its PL spectrum. Therefore, the persistent luminescence of BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> derives from the 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup> â†’ 4f
 <sup>7</sup> transition of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>c shows the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the persistent luminescence of BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, and the persistent luminescence can last for 8 h. We observe that BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> can also emit yellow persistent luminescence without adding the Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion; however, the intensity is weak. The persistent luminescence intensity of the sample improves much after adding Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>. With the further increase in Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration, the persistent luminescence intensity of the sample increases gradually. However, when the Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration is above 0.1, the persistent luminescence intensity of the sample decreases. This indicates that the addition of Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> changes the trap distribution of the material and improves the energy storage ability of the materials. With the addition of Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, the amount of traps increases in the materials. The persistent luminescence intensity increases therewith. When Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> reaches a certain concentration, the co-doped ions cause concentration quenching with the addition of the doped concentration, which decreases the persistent luminescence intensity.
