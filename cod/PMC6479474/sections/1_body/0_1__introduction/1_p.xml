<p>Melamine (IUPAC: 1,3,5-Triazine-2,4,6-triamine) has wide industrial importance, nowadays being used e.g., in the manufacture of polymers and resin [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], concrete [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], flame-resistant materials [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and it may be utilized in the production of nanomaterials (e.g., 
 <italic>N</italic>-doped carbon nanotubes) [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the past, it was even more widely applied in industry and agriculture [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was unfortunate that melamine has become infamous worldwide as a dairy adulterant after it caused a milk safety crisis in 2008 with severe casualties (290,000 people affected with 51,900 hospitalized in China only) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. That event had a global impact on the food industry, food production, supply chains, and corresponding legal regulations [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It strongly echoed in the field of food quality control, leading to a strong stimulus for development and the adaptation of adequate analytical routines [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A number of other food safety incidents in recent years have induced particular pressure on this area of analytical chemistry [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The methods that are based on vibrational spectroscopy [infrared (IR), Raman and near-infrared (NIR)] have become particularly important elements of this effort in controlling the food safety at every stage of its production and supply [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
