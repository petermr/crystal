<p id="Par8">The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiment was performed to demonstrate the crystalline nature of 3D-TPE-COF. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the experimental PXRD pattern displayed amounts of intense diffraction peaks, indicating the presence of a long-range ordered structure. However, it was very difficult to determinate the structure from PXRD data, due to the serious overlap of diffraction peaks. Since the nano- and micrometer-sized crystals can be treated as single crystal in electron crystallography, RED technique has recently been applied as a powerful tool for the structure determination of 3D COFs with 
 <bold>dia</bold> topology
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The newly developed technique, cRED
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>, was then used to collect 3D electron diffraction, in which the time for data collection can be reduced to less than 5 min (see Supplementary method 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> for details). After carefully analysing the cRED data, we successfully located the central carbon atoms of tetrahedral and quadrilateral building blocks (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>) by 
 <italic>SHELXT</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. Based on the atom coordinates determined from cRED data, we were able to build a structure model with seven-fold interpenetrated 
 <bold>pts</bold> net (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) using the Materials studio software package, in which the calculated PXRD patterns of optimized model matched well with the experimental data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The Le Bail fitting was performed on the experimental PXRD of 3D-TPE-COF, which yields a unit cell with parameters (
 <italic>a</italic> = 27.331(1) Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 8.543(5) Å, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 31.508(0) Å, 
 <italic>α</italic> = 
 <italic>γ</italic>  = 90°, and 
 <italic>β</italic> = 90.476(0)°, 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <italic>/c</italic>). The final 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>wp</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>p</sub> values converged to 3.59 and 2.38%, respectively. Therefore, 3D-TPE-COF is identified to adopt a seven-fold interpenetrated 
 <bold>pts</bold> topology with 
 <italic>P</italic>2/
 <italic>c</italic> space group.
