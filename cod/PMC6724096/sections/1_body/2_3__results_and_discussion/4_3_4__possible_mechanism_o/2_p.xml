 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01173-f012">Figure 12</xref> shows a possible mechanism of photocatalytic enhancement. It has been shown that the iron in Fe-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> exists in the form of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and maintains a highly uniform distribution, while the radius of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> is close to that of Ti
 <sup>4+</sup>, which is conducive to the formation of uniform substitution doping into the lattice [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-01173" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], resulting in a doping level with low width. The generation of this energy level leads to the red shift of light absorption. At the same time, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> exhibits a transformation of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>→Fe
 <sup>4+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>→Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, which can capture and transfer photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively [
