<p id="Par16">Note that the above ML models and analysis results are for systems of GB particles with aspect ratios of 3.0. For GB particles with aspect ratios of 2.8 or 3.2, however, the analysis results using the same ML models are almost the same as those for GB particle with aspect ratios of 3.0 (data not shown). This indicates that the ML models are not significantly influenced by the aspect ratio over the range 2.8â€“3.2.</p>
