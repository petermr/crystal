<p>Luminescent properties of V- doped Y

 <sub>12</sub> nanocrystals were investigated upon 266 nm of excitation in the −150 °C to 300 °C (123.15 K to 573.15 K) temperature range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The emission spectrum obtained at −150 °C consists of three transition bands, for materials with Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration from 1 to 4, and of two emission bands for YGG, being related to the presence of different V oxidations states - V
 <sup>5+</sup>, V
 <sup>4+</sup> and V
 <sup>3+</sup>. In the course of our previous investigation, it was found that due to the difference in the ionic radii and the charge, V
 <sup>5+</sup> ions preferentially occupy surface sites of Al
 <sup>3+</sup>, while V
 <sup>3+</sup> and V
 <sup>4+</sup> are mainly located in the core part of the nanoparticles [

 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The first broad emission band at 520 nm is attributed to the charge transfer transition of V
 <sup>5+</sup>(V
 <sup>4+</sup> → O
 <sup>2−</sup>). The second band at 640 nm originates from 
 <sup>2</sup>E → 
 <sup>2</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub> radiative transition of V
 <sup>4+</sup> ions, while the band at 820 nm is associated with 
 <sup>1</sup>E
 <sub>2</sub> → 
 <sup>3</sup>T
 <sub>1g</sub> transition of V
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. As can be seen, the addition of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions significantly affects the luminescent properties of Y

 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The representative emission spectra measured at −150 °C indicate that the increase of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration caused the enhancement of the V
 <sup>4+</sup> emission intensity in respect to the V
 <sup>5+</sup> and V
 <sup>3+</sup> ones. This effect results from the large ionic radii of V
 <sup>4+</sup>, which significantly exceeds Al
 <sup>3+</sup> ones. Therefore, V
 <sup>4+</sup> cannot efficiently replace Al
 <sup>3+</sup> in the structure. However, when the concentration of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> ions gradually increases, the number of the crystallographic sites that can be occupied by V
 <sup>4+</sup> rises up, leading to the enhancement of 
 <sup>2</sup>E → 
 <sup>2</sup>T
 <sub>2</sub> emission intensity. Moreover, the Ga-doping induces the reduction of the distance between V
 <sup>4+</sup> and V
 <sup>5+</sup> ions facilitating the energy transfer between them, which contributed to the V
 <sup>4+</sup> luminescent intensity increase. It is worth noticing that the emission of trivalent V dominates in the spectrum up to x = 4, while in the case of YGG V
 <sup>4+</sup>, the emission band prevails. To quantify these changes the histogram presenting the contribution of the emission intensities (calculated as an integral emission intensity in appropriate spectral range) of particular oxidation state of vanadium ions to the overall emission intensity as a function of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f002">Figure 2</xref>c. The observed enhancement of V
 <sup>4+</sup> emission intensity with respect to the V
 <sup>5+</sup> with an increase of Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration causes tuning of the emission color toward red emission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01375-f002">Figure 2</xref>d). However, for YGG:V, orange emission was found. As has been already proven, the V
 <sup>5+</sup> ions are located mainly in the surface part of the nanocrystals [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-09-01375" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since the morphology and the size of the nanoparticle is independent on the Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration, the number of V
 <sup>5+</sup> can be assumed to be constant. The confirmation of this hypothesis is the fact that its lifetime (&lt;τ
 <sub>V5+</sub>&gt; = 6.4 ms) is independent on the host stoichiometry (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-01375">Figure S1</xref>). On the other hand, the average lifetime of V
 <sup>3+</sup> and V
 <sup>4+</sup> shortens consequently from 7.6 ms to 7.0 ms and 1.2 ms to 0.5 ms, respectively, with Ga
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration (x changed from 1 to 5).
