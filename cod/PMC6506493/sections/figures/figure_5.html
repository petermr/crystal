 <caption> Schematic view of expected pseudomagnetic field and edge states. a Distribution of a pseudomagnetic field induced on the triplon bands. Each solid curve represents a pseudomagnetic field with a fixed k y (see Eq. ( 5) for its definition). b Energy spectrum along the K direction. The calculation is based on the model presented in Fig.  1b, in which open boundary conditions with 200 sites (100 for each sublattice) are imposed along the a direction while periodic boundary conditions are set along the b direction. Half of the all modes are shown, and edge states are stressed by a red line for clarity. c The interdimer network in Ba 2CuSi 2O 6Cl 2 shown as SSH chains coupled by interchain hoppings. The same symbols and lines as those in Fig.  1 are used. An ellipsoid and a dashed rectangle represent a pair of dimers with a larger hopping amplitudes and a single coupled SSH chain, respectively </caption>
