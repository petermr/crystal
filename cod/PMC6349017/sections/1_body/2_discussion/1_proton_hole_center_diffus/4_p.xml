 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref> reveals the source of the very different calculated PHC diffusion coefficients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref>) for diffusion along ±[12[combining macron]10] (horizontal) and ±[0001] (vertical) at ZnO(101[combining macron]0). Diffusion along ±[12[combining macron]10] is driven by consecutive adlayer-PT events (thick blue horizontal lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Although the other major type of PT mechanism, surface-PT (green in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref>), transfers the PHC along the polar ±[0001] direction, it gives no long-range 
 <italic>diffusion</italic> along ±[0001[combining macron]], since surface-PT transfers the PHC between Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> and O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> (eqn (3)), and PHC(O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup>) constitutes a dead end. Thus, diffusion along the polar ±[0001] direction can only happen 
 <italic>via</italic> the solvent-assisted PT mechanism (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), which we found to be very rare. The “jump” at around 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1 ns for the pink PHC trajectory along [0001[combining macron]] in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref> corresponds to such a solvent-assisted PT event (depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, for the vast majority of the time, the PHC positions simply oscillated between the O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> and Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> positions on neighboring surface “dimers” (see for example the green, blue, and orange trajectories along [0001[combining macron]] for ZnO(101[combining macron]0) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In contrast, along the nonpolar [12[combining macron]10] direction, several trajectories spanned several nm; in the examples in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref>, the PHCs indicated by the green and blue lines diffused about 1 nm (or about three lattice parameters along [12[combining macron]10]) in 2 ns.
