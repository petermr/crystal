<p id="Par17">To quantitatively investigate the morphology variation, we fitted the middle layer of (001) nanoplate by the quadric surface equation

 <sup>2</sup> indicates the fitting degree, and its ideal value equals to 1. In accordance with the energy variations, the corresponding transitions of these fitting parameters are also observed at the critical points between different stages. The critical temperatures are identified to be 8, 129, and 205 K. During the first three stages, the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> stays higher than 0.8, implying that the (001) nanoplate approximately keeps its saddle shape. Since the parameter c is obviously larger than both a and b, the two raised sections of the nanoplate are oriented along the [110] direction. Meanwhile, the value of c significantly increases after the first stage, which suggests the remarkably bending upwards surface. This tendency can be clearly perceived from the representative snapshots in Fig.

Each bending deformation pulls the system out of its former metastable state and results in a slight drop in the potential energy. These minor adjustments of shape and energy end at 205 K, from where the fourth stage starts and the original saddle surface gradually collapses into an irregular particle with further minimized energy.
