  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. The crux of the argument is that the strength of the electron correlations promoting the localization of the 5f electrons has been determined to be much weaker
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> than previously assumed
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. In terms of intra-atomic Coulomb interactions, the effective Hubbard U is claimed to be about 1 eV for all plutonium phases (and uranium as well)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> in contradiction to the conventionally expected large U ~ 4–4.5 eV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. A large effective U parameter in DFT + U-related approaches is a prerequisite for 5f-localization in plutonium. Contrarily, it was recently shown
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> that the existence of a small Hubbard U (~1 eV) is more consistent with delocalized character of the 5f electrons, particularly when spin–orbit coupling and orbital–orbital interaction (orbital polarization) are considered. The only way to conclusively decide between these theoretical models for plutonium is to gather experimental evidence that support or contradict the respective approach. Lattice vibrations or phonons are fundamental properties that provide such evidence.
