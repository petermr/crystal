<p>Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been used in LEDs due to their highly efficient PL and wide color modulation in the visible and near‐infrared ranges. In addition to the above‐mentioned characteristics, (quasi‐) 2D perovskites show fascinating prospects in LED application with the large exciton binding energy. From the point of view of fabrication, layered 2D perovskites have good film processability with excellent optical properties. The published (quasi‐) 2D perovskite–based LEDs are summarized in
