 <caption> Calculated phonon density of states (pDOS) for α-SiB 2.5 (a) and β-SiB 3 (b), cf. Figure 11 . The total pDOS is depicted as the broken, black line. The partial pDOS of icosahedron and dumbbell forming atoms are shown as green and orange lines, respectively. For comparison, the Raman spectra are included at the top of each panel (in light gray). </caption>
