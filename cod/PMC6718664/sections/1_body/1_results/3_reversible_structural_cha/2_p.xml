<p id="Par8">The Na K-edge spectra of partially dehydrated Na-bir at fully discharged state is very similar to that of the reference layered compound, NaNi
 <sub>1/3</sub>Fe
 <sub>1/3</sub>Mn
 <sub>1/3</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which exhibits two major characteristic peaks at ~1080 and ~1087 eV as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>, suggesting that its Na local environment at fully discharged state is similar to that of the typical layered compound. Because the reversible movement of Mn ions between MnO
 <sub>2</sub> layer (3a) and the interlayer (6c) induces the phase transformation between the layered and spinel-like structure, all the Na ions look like being octahedrally coordinated by the neighboring oxygen atoms at the discharged state with the layered structure. By contrast, at the charged state having the spinel-like structure, the Na ions are partially coordinated by four neighboring oxygen atoms in the tetrahedral sites. The latter can be modeled by first-principles atomistic relaxation for the Mn-migrated structure as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>. The investigation on Mn and Na local environments by XAS clearly proves high reversibility of the local structural change as the material transforms between the layered and spinel-like phases during electrochemical cycling. This reversible phase transformation has also been demonstrated by ex situ Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The characteristic Raman band of partially dehydrated Na-bir is changed after charge, which results from an increased separation between two successive slabs due to the strengthened repulsion between the oxygen atoms from the adjacent slabs. As mentioned above, the sharp band at around 640–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is typically assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated Mn–O bonding, which is indicative of a spinel-like phase. The Raman spectra of partially dehydrated Na-bir show a newly emerged peak at ~575–585 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> together with the decrease of band intensity at ~640–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> after discharge, which implies that it has an arrangement of layered structure. As well consistent to the aforementioned analysis results, the partially dehydrated Na-bir shows high reversibility

 </sup>. Therefore, controlling crystal water contents in birnessite looks critical to enable the structural reversibility because hydrated Na-bir exhibited a clearly limited reversibility as shown in Supplementary Fig.
