<p id="Par3">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the working of a pentacene thin film based organic field effect transistor (OFET) in negative as well as positive source-drain bias (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub>) regime. A negative gate voltage (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </sub>) accumulates a layer of holes at organic/dielectric interface. When a negative 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> is applied, charge carriers flow from source to drain and two different regions; accumulation region near source and depletion region due to the pinch off the channel near drain exist (schematically show in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>). However, in positive 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime, working of the OFET is different from that in negative 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime. When a positive bias is applied at drain, device structure becomes quite similar to a hole only two terminal device (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>). There are however two key differences; (i) organic thin film is sandwiched laterally between two metal electrodes whereas it is sandwiched vertically in two terminal devices, and (ii) an additional 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </sub> is used to control the density of background charge carriers in the device. In positive 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime, as drain is at higher potential than source, holes are injected at the drain electrode and move towards source i.e. source and drain are interchanged. Further, in this regime, as there is no pinch-off, no depletion region is observed within the channel rather only accumulation region exists for the whole channel. Figure

 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>

 <sub>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </sub> in both, negative as well as positive 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>DS</italic>
 </sub> regime due to an increase in density of free holes. The crux of the matter is how to operate OFET so that Fermi level can be sufficiently moved up in the high density of states region from the region with low density of states in GDOS.
