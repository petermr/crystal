<p>Few shape changes except for the torsion mentioned above were observed in fetuses with an OSL of â‰¥10 mm. Procrustes analysis showed that all anatomical landmarks were located in the same position. Remodeling at the metaphysis and epiphysis during the growth of a long bone such as the femur is well known as the mechanism that maintains the shape [
 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For remodeling, osseous tissues have to be added and removed at the metaphysis and epiphysis of the developing long bone. Anatomical landmarks remained in the same relative position during subsequent endochondral ossification in the present study, indicating that the remodeling system during femur shaft growth in the longitudinal direction is elaborate.
