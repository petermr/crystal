<p>The extra two electrons left after the vacancy formation could form an F-center at the vacant lattice site or enter the Ti 3
 <italic>d</italic> band and, potentially, localize to form Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> species. A number of previous theoretical studies have described the formation of these localized states (Lindan et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Muscat et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Deak et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The ground state considered here corresponds to the occupation of a localized 3
 <italic>d</italic> orbital on each of two next-nearest neighbors, a Ti
 <sub>5
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> atom in the first trilayer and a Ti
 <sub>6
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> in the third trilayer (cyan atoms in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). A previous PP–PW (PBE+U) study also suggested that this configuration for the reduced titanium ions is the most stable (Stetsovych et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This is also the case in calculations based on hybrid functionals. For example, the configuration where two nearest neighbor Ti ions are reduced (magenta atoms in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) is a local energy minimum but has an energy 0.82 eV higher than the one described above. The reduction of two Ti
 <sup>4+</sup> ions is confirmed by the spin–polarized DOS presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. The two Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> ions have a magnetic moment of 0.90 and 0.91 μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> for AE–LCAO (3LYP), 0.92 and 0.91 μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> for AE–LCAO (HSE) and 0.91 and 0.89 μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> for PP–PW (PBE+U). The new localized states, mainly formed by Ti 3
 <italic>d</italic> orbitals from the Ti
 <sub>6
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> in the third trilayer and the Ti
 <sub>5
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> in the first trilayer, appear at 1.0 and 1.3 eV below the conduction band for AE–LCAO (HSE). PP–PW (PBE+U) gives a very similar result (1.1, 1.3 eV), while AE–LCAO–B3LYP predicts those states to be deeper in the band gap (1.2, 1.5 eV). The AE–LCAO (HSE) calculation is in good agreement with photoemission experiments, which identify a state at around 1 eV bellow the CBM (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).
