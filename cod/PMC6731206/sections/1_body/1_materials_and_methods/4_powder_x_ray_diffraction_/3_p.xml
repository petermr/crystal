<p id="p0110">The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed on Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer (Japan) (Cu Kα). The X-ray generator operated at a power of 40 kW and 30 mA, the scanning speed was 1.0°/min, with a pitch of 0.02°, in an angular range of 3–50° (2 theta). The obtained diffractograms were analyzed in accordance with the Rietveld method
