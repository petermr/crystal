<p>Sintered reaction pellets and α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> crystals were subjected to extensive EDX analysis (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b02727/suppl_file/ao9b02727_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figures S13–S15</ext-link>, Supporting Information). Flux-grown crystals showed homogeneous values, 25(1) atom % Si and 75(1) atom % B, within and between crystal specimens, which indicates a composition near SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, i.e., 
 <italic>x</italic> ≈ 0. However, as discussed in 
 <xref rid="sec2.3" ref-type="other">Section 
  <xref rid="sec2.3" ref-type="other">2.3</xref>
 </xref>, Si/B ratios obtained from EDX cannot be considered accurate due to lack of standards. EDX analysis of sintered pellets was in addition hampered by the small size and irregular shape of particles. Backscattered electron images, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>, provide qualitative information on Si/B compositional variations. At the same time, one has to be aware of the fact that because of the heterogeneous nature of sintered reaction pellets, contrast variations will also be caused by density differences between sample areas (cf. 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
