<p>Mode shapes of the free vibrating DRG working at ~7.2 kHz (ring width, radius step, anchor radius and ring number are 6 μm, 36 μm, 1 mm, and 16, respectively) are obtained by simulation and calculation methods, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f011">Figure 11</xref>. It can be seen that the DRG mode shape obtained by simulation with the software COMSOL and the mode shape obtained by calculation with the software MATLAB are completely identical.
