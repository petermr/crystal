<p>The final spectra were simulated with the band broadening being obtained through a four-parameter Lorentzâ€“Gauss product function [

 <xref rid="B70-molecules-24-01402" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] being applied to the quantum mechanically calculated IR and NIR band positions and intensities. The necessary data processing and assembly of figures were carried out in MATLAB R2016b [
