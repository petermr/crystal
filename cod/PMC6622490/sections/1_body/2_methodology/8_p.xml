<p>Electric energy is then calculated by the equation (5) for one transducer: Δ Electric Energy (one transducer) = (Electric power calculated in step (4) * 10–6 * Average time) (watt sec) or (Joules) [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], where the average time (2 hours) is the time of taking the measurements of noise levels of total 12 hours in 6 time interval. Then to calculate the total converted energy produced from known number of transducers can be calculated through the following equation (6): Total Electric Energy = No. of transducers X the electric energy produced by one transducer in equation (5).
