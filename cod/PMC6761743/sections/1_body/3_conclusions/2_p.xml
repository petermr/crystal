<p>An examination of the vibrational properties revealed that MS and M
 <sub>31</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu) are dynamically stable such that the formation of a given metal-deficient sulfide appears to be controlled by effects in the electronic (band) structures. In the case of the zirconium-containing sulfides, an inspection of the phonon densities-of-states showed that the presence of vacancies apparently alleviates a dynamic instability for that sulfide; yet, the negative values of the phonon frequencies indicate that all of the inspected zirconium sulfides should be dynamically unstable. In the electronic band structures of LuS, M
 <sub>31</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu), and Zr
 <sub>29</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub>, the Fermi levels are crossed by flat bands, which are in good agreement with a flat band/steep band scenario expected for superconductors. Because the populations of flat bands at the Fermi level in a given material are indicative of an electronically unfavorable situation, the nature of bonding was examined for all sulfides to explain the trends for the formation of the metal-deficient sulfides.
