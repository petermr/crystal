 </bold>, we were able to predict the relative sensitivity of all the 11 EMs studied, which was shown to be BTF &gt; ζ-CL-20 &gt; γ-CL-20 &gt; β-CL-20 &gt; ε-CL-20 &gt; CL-20/HMX &gt; CL-20/H
 <sub>2</sub>O &gt; CL-20/DNB &gt; CL-20/TNT &gt; CL-20/NMP/H
 <sub>2</sub>O &gt; TATB. The predicted order shows a close relationship between the shock sensitivity and the hydrogen bonding amount. For example, BTF contains no hydrogen and it owns the highest sensitivity, whereas TATB contains the most hydrogen and it has the lowest sensitivity.
