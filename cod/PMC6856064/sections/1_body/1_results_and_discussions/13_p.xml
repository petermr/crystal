In the TM-30 standard, 99 color samples are used to evaluate the light source’s performance. Except for the 1B-Y LED, all other LED PKGs exhibit high color fidelity in TM-30 standard. Figure

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b,d,f)</xref> show the local chroma shifts of the light emitted from the 1B-Y, 1B-GR, and 1B-BYR LEDs (red circles) compared to the reference illuminant (black circles). The arrows in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a,c,e)</xref> indicate the shift of the 16 hue bins compared to those of the reference illuminant.
