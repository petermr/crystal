<p>The PBE-D2 lattice energy landscape has a distinct packing, structure 8, as the global minimum. On the basis of the structure comparisons of the low energy structures, it can be concluded that phenytoin has numerous possibilities to form stable structures, which are based on distinct hydrogen bonding motifs. Indeed, the packing motifs of the yet unobserved forms can be found in the chemically related structure group of barbiturates.

 </sup> Packing similarities within groups of structures sharing strong H-bonding interactions may be indicative of disorder, polytypism/domain structures

 </sup> It should be noted that all computed structures are static, and the packings may allow phenyl ring rotations at finite temperature with minimal cost in intramolecular energy, but significant entropic stabilization.
