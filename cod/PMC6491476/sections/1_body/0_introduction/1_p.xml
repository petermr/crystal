<p id="Par2">Growing demand for advanced materials with enhanced functionality promotes expansion of the set of accessible structures. While stable materials have been efficiently identified and produced, meta-stable states are considered as a big challenge to be predicted and realized. Glass-forming alloys offer a rich landscape of non-equilibrium states, both crystalline and non-crystalline, and far-from equilibrium pathways to access them. The pathways can be manipulated through changing the starting points of materials, such as the processing parameters and the chemical composition of alloy. Al-Sm alloys, known as marginal glass formers, provide a prototypical model system where a rich collection of intermediate meta-stable crystalline phases can be accessed through path-dependent devitrification processing

 </sup>. A fundamental scientific question is, what is the underlying physics mechanism of phase selections in this far-from-equilibrium system and how to control the pathways to access a myriad of meta-stable structures. A basic understanding of the physical principles that govern these pathways could very well enable application of the same principles to many different systems.
