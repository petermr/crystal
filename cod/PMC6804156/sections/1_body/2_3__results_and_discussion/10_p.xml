<p>The temperature-dependent excitation spectra (λ
 <sub>em</sub> = 615 nm) of Rb
 <sub>2</sub>Eu(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)(MoO
 <sub>4</sub>) sample recorded at 77 and 500 K are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03275-f004">Figure 4</xref>a. These spectra show some considerable differences. First of all, the charge transfer band becomes much broader at elevated temperatures, meaning that electron from O
 <sup>2−</sup> ions is transferred to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions much easier at high temperatures. Besides that, some lines in excitation spectra also disappear at low temperatures. For instance, lines that originate from thermally populated 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> level are not observed in excitation spectra recorded at 77 K. These include 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> → 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>3</sub>, 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> → 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> → 
 <sup>5</sup>D
 <sub>0</sub> transitions occurring at around 415, 534 and 590 nm, respectively. The absence of excitation lines from 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> level indicates that thermal population of 
 <sup>7</sup>F
 <sub>1</sub> level at low temperatures is very limited.
