<p>In this study, various forms of N-CDots have been employed as water-based color-conversion layers over blue LED chips to generate white light. We observed that drop-cast PVP/N-CDot composite films show promising white-light properties at higher N-CDot concentrations. In addition, since the white light generated using these films suffers from a red deficiency, commercial red phosphor can be integrated into the PVP/N-CDot composite films. The additional red emission improves the LER and the luminous flux, and as a consequence, satisfying white-light properties can be achieved at a lower amount of N-CDots. Additionally, PVP/N-CDot composite fibers were produced and successfully employed as color conversion layers over a blue LED chip. We produced electrospun composite fibers that contain only a small amount of N-CDots (in total 15 Î¼L), and we were able to adjust the properties of the generated white light by varying the amount of the fiber within the color conversion layers, finally achieving a CRI of 90 and a CCT of 6000 K. This result is surprising because the fibers were produced using a N-CDot solution (with a low percentage of N-CDots) which yielded no valid CRI and CCT values when processed into a drop-cast composite film. Hence, using fibers, one can significantly reduce the amount of N-CDots used. In summary, the N-CDot-based generation of white light with satisfactory white-light properties was explored by employing different forms of color conversion layers. The white light resulting from the probed configurations showed satisfactory characteristics in terms of CRI, CCT, LER and luminous flux, which makes N-CDots a promising material for use in phosphor-converted WLED applications.</p>
