<p id="Par9">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d–f</xref> show the projections of the high-pressure phase, hereafter named post-tilleyite, along the crystallographic axes. Although the transition comes with a volume collapse of ∼1.5%, the symmetry of the initial and final structures is related by a group-subgroup relationship and they can be easily compared (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–f</xref>). The coordination spheres around the C and Si atoms by O atoms have not changed, remaining in trigonal planar and tetrahedral configuration. However, in contrast to tilleyite, the [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] groups in post-tilleyite are no longer coplanar with each other. Half of them maintain their initial orientation whereas ¼ are now roughly perpendicular to the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis and ¼ are roughly perpendicular to the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis. A similar rotation of carbonate groups was observed in the high-pressure polymorph of calcite, CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>-III

 </sup>. This fact supports previous descriptions of tilleyite in terms of silicate and carbonate separated layer modules, where the CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> component seems to follow a crystal behavior comparable to that of calcite itself in the same pressure range (CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>-III is reported to be stable between 2.5 and 15 GPa).
