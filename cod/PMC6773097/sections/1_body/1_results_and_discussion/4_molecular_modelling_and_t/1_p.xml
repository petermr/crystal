<p>The molecular modelling results show that the SDA is located exclusively in the heart‐shaped cavity, which fits around the SDA (isomer III) like a glove (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). At a maximum occupancy of 0.5 on a position of mirror symmetry, there is one SDA (with two possible orientations) per heart‐shaped cavity, or four (8 N
 <sup>+</sup>) per unit cell. Based on elemental analyses (Supporting Information Table S12), the Si:Al ratio of the framework was estimated to be 14.5, which translates to 7.5 Al per unit cell, so the charge from the SDA balances that of the framework nicely. This would indicate that there are no additional organic cations in the 42T cavity, where the second cloud of residual electrostatic potential was found, and that is consistent with the fact that the cavity is too small to accommodate an SDA cation. On the other hand, the elemental analysis also indicates the presence of a small amount of residual Na
 <sup>+</sup> (approximately 1.0 per cell), which could be located in the 42T cavity with an occupancy of 0.5. This may indicate that the SDA is not fully occupied, which we have observed before.
