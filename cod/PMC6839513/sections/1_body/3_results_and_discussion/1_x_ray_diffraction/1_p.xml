<p>Various reports demonstrated that phenytoin can assemble in two different polymorphs.

 </sup> Spin coating, heating from the amorphous phase, or even solvent vapor annealing are shown to produce these phases. While these reports evidenced solely the presence of the bulk form (
 <bold>form I</bold>), the formation of solely the surface induced phase is hard to achieve. Nevertheless, optimizing the preparation procedure allowed obtaining samples of the phenytoin thin film phase with only a very little amount of concomitant 
 <bold>form I</bold> (see

Using a spin coating process at the elevated temperature of 31 Â°C and a concentration of 1 mg/mL in THF was revealed to be the optimum condition for the 
 <bold>form II</bold> (SIP) growth. Looking on the narrow parameter set for its formation, this means its occurrence delicately depends on the parameters, whereby the bulk form (
 <bold>form I</bold>) nucleates and grows over a much larger parameter range, even resulting in various habits or crystal textures.

 </sup> Up to now, we only were able to achieve the 
 <bold>form II</bold> when growth is performed in the vicinity of substrate and within thin films. This suggests that this phase is a surface induced thin film phase.
