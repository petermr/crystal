 </sup> pointed out that the thickness of the reacting layer affects the final product of the solid-state reaction, and the smaller the film thickness, the higher the nucleation temperature is required. Meng

 </sup> studied the interdiffusion reaction in Ti/Ni system at 523 K for 10 h with an individual layer thickness of 10 nm (the overall atomic ratio is Ti
 <sub>44</sub>Ni
 <sub>56</sub>). They found that the Ti/Ni reaction product was a simple intermetallic. However, in this study, the peak strength weakened, and the peak width increased distinctly, the layered sample tends to form an amorphous structure instead after heat treatment at 373 K for 110 h with an individual layer thickness around 5 nm as shown in Fig.

 </sup>, the same intermetallic compounds form at both temperatures. Therefore, it is the layer thickness that affects the state of the final product of the reaction in this case. It is beneficial to the formation of the amorphous structure to decrease the thickness of the layer. We believe that the amorphous region will become larger when the thickness of the reacting layer is further reduced, and the reaction time is increased.
