<p id="Par3">In the last 20 years, the X-ray diffraction tomography (XRDT) method has been widely applied to investigate the real crystalline materials. In this method, the plate-parallel crystal sample is rotated around an axis perpendicular to a set of reflection crystal planes, namely: the rotation axis is chosen to coincide with the diffraction vector

Each of these XRDT 2D projections corresponds to a certain orientation of the X-ray diffraction planes relative to the intrinsic Cartesian system of coordinates of the crystal sample as it is shown in Fig.Â
