 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the internal coordinates, multiplicities, and Wyckoff positions of sites occupied by constituent chemical elements. The effective coordination numbers of Fe and Ge are natural numbers, 6 (in an octahedral site) and 4 (in a tetrahedral site), respectively, whereas that of Ca is ~7.8 [in a dodecahedral site (bisdisphenoid)]. The bond lengths of Fe–O and Ge–O significantly differ (2.05 and 1.79 Å, respectively). The Ca–O bond lengths, which are significantly longer than the above two lengths, slightly deviate; half of them are 2.41 Å, while the other half are 2.54 Å. All of the O atoms occupy the same sites, 96
 <italic>h</italic>, forming two, one, and one chemical bonds (in the tetrahedral site) with Ca, Fe, and Ge, respectively. Therefore, the 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>O</sub> sites are identical to each other.
