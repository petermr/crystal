 </inline-formula> stacking between the neighboring star centers along the columns play an essential role in this system. These two interactions are responsible for assembling a single structure from very first aggregates, that appear at the initial stage of the ordering process. The question of quantifying these stabilizing forces is open and is, therefore, one of the goals of this study.
