<p>Here, we study the influence of the temperature and deposition rate on the morphology evolution of lithium-based VANs by applying a KMCS model with activation energies for hopping obtained experimentally and with minimum restrictions for hopping directions. The combination of KMCS and reflective high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) measurements provides an elegant tool to predict the growth of VAN materials. Although the model considers only the kinetic processes away from thermodynamic equilibrium, which would determine the final shape of the pillars within the matrix, the trends in pillar size and distribution within the simulated VANs are in good agreement with experiments. We demonstrate that experimental activation energies and higher degrees of freedom for hopping result in a more realistic and low computational cost model that can be used to obtain accurate simulation results for VAN materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful growth of lithium-based VANs consisting of the promising LiMn
