 </xref> shows a topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and a three-dimensional surface profile of the CdSe/ZnS-B2 polymer nanocomposite film prepared by spin-coating and UV curing. In 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>a, the bright spots correspond to the QD particles and the dark areas correspond to the B2 polymer matrix. The examination of 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a reveals that the spherical aggregates have a relatively uniform spot distribution due to the QD aggregates separated within the polymer domain. The particle size distribution at about 33 nm corresponds to a QD cluster comprising several individual QDs (diameter 7–10 nm, see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>a,b), indicating that the oleic acid (OA)-capped QDs tend to aggregate generating QD clusters, but these QDs are relatively uniformly distributed in the cured polymer matrix. In addition, some small hillocks are relatively uniformly distributed in the three-dimensional image of the nanocomposite film as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b, corresponding to an average roughness of about ∼6 nm.
