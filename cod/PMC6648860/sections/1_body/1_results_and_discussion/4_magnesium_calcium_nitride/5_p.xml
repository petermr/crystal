<p>The as-prepared sample consists of micrometric aggregates of nanometric and sub-micrometric particles (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>B) with homogeneous composition, as confirmed by EDX analysis. Attempts to extract Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> from this phase were carried out, both by chemical oxidation reaction with NO
 <sub>2</sub>BF
 <sub>4</sub> and by electrochemical methods. For the electrochemical experiments, Ca
 <sub>0.89</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> was mixed with conductive Super P carbon in 85:15% wt ratio and subjected to electrochemical oxidation (de-insertion) tests in Ca metal cells under various conditions. As no electrochemical activity could be observed at RT, additional experiments were carried out at moderate temperature (100 °C).

 </xref>C displays the characteristic potential versus capacity profiles observed for Ca
 <sub>0.89</sub>TaN

 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, EC/PC 1:1 vol electrolyte. The potential signature displayed is the measured potential difference between the working and the counter electrodes (each measured vs passivated Ca reference). A full oxidation up to capacity values of about 170 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> (corresponding to Δ
 <italic>x</italic> mol of virtually extracted Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ions of about 0.7) is reported in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>C, together with an oxidation–reduction limited to lower values of delivered specific capacity (i.e. about 0.3 mol of virtually exchange Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ions). A plateau centered at about 4.5 V is observed upon oxidation with high polarization upon further reduction, both using tape or powder electrodes. A variation of the powder sample color from dark gray to light brown was detected both after the chemical and electrochemical oxidation tests, reasonably suggesting a variation of the tantalum oxidation state. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of Ca
 <sub>0.89</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> at the end of the oxidation (de-insertion) process and after oxidation–reduction are reported in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>D, together with the patterns corresponding to the pristine phase and the powder recovered after 10 h of reaction with NO
 <sub>2</sub>BF
 <sub>4</sub> at 80 °C in acetonitrile (ACN).
