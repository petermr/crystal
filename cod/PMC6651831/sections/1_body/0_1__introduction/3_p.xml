<p>Until now, most studies on transverse thermoelectric composites assumed isotropic material properties in the component phase. However, many studies have already shown that thermoelectric materials can exhibit anisotropic properties, such as Bi

 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-02049" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], etc. As a result, anisotropic material properties were applied into the component phase of layered transverse thermoelectric composites, and the results showed that the maximum Z
