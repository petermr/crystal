<p id="Par6">At first an equimolar TaNbHfZr HEA initial random structure was created with a bcc lattice framework. The atomic sites of the created 18 × 18 × 18 supercell structure was randomly assigned the 4 different atom types. The lattice parameter (LP) at 1800 °C was found to be 3.54 Å and this LP was used for all the MC/MD evolved structures. The details of the simulation procedures are given in the Methods section. The system had 11664 atoms and a total number of 583200 MC trials were performed, giving rise to up to 50 attempted MC swaps per atom. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the evolved nanostructures are displayed for the different stages of structural evolution. The simulation box along with its periodic neighbours is presented. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the initial random substitutional alloy structure and the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–f</xref> shows the alloy structures evolved after 10, 15, 25, 35 and 50 attempted MC swaps per atom (henceforth called MC swaps), respectively. At a first glance, it can be noticed that with increasing number of attempted swaps, the maroon and orange (Zr and Hf) atoms have a tendency of clustering together. After around 15 MC swaps, the Zr and Hf rich atomic co-clusters of SRCs become much prominent and it appears that they appear perpendicular to the &lt;1 0 0&gt; crystallographic directions. At around 25 MC swaps it was observed that the SRCs grow larger perpendicular to the &lt;1 0 0&gt; directions and gradually become interconnected with each other. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, as the structure evolves further, the smaller Zr and Hf-rich SRCs tend to fuse into a wide band like SRC, which grows independently along the X, Y and Z planes and ultimately touches each other at nodes. The Ta and Nb atoms also cluster together in adjacent regions, which gets isolated and forms a cuboid-like region later on with more MC swaps. Near the node the SRCs look like forming a cross-type pattern, which was also experimentally found in the system during annealing treatment at 1800 °C as characterized by HRTEM and APT
