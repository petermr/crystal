 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the Z-density profiles of water molecules and H
 <sub>w</sub> in the interlayer spaces of montmorillonites with different charge density. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the two distribution peaks of water molecules in the interlayer domain are located about –1.3 Å and 1.5 Å along the central axis, respectively, indicating that water molecules are mainly concentrated on both sides of the interlayer central axis of montmorillonite, while the two distribution peaks of H
 <sub>w</sub> (H in water molecule) are located about –2.5 Å and 2.4 Å, which is about 0.9 Å closer to the Si-O surface than that of water molecules. It indicates that due to the hydrogen bonds force formed by H
 <sub>w</sub> and O
 <sub>t</sub> (O in the tetrahedron), the water molecules are deflected, so the H
 <sub>w</sub> are closer to the Si-O surface than that of the water molecules.
