   <p>The C-terminus of one of the TsaB copies in the asymmetric unit: amino acids 194â€“205 that were missing in the 6FPE structure could be constructed into the density.</p>

   <p>Modeling of a nucleotide bound at the active site of TsaD. We initially cautiously interpreted the residual electron density by glycerol and PEG moieties present in the crystal freezing liquor. The new maps clearly showed that a nucleotide was bound at this location (Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We could easily fit the density by AMPCPP, present as a ligand in the crystallization solution.
