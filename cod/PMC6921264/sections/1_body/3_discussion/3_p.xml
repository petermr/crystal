 </xref>. As a whole, the FF can be used to give a similar description on no-bonding interaction with that obtained at the PBE0-XDM/aug-cc-pVDZ level. Except HB2, the equilibrium distances and well depths are in great agreement with those by DFT. The curves of π–π2 from FF and DFT are nearly overlapping, and the equilibrium distance of π–π2 should be shorter by less than 0.1 Å, and the well depth of HB1 are increased by less than 0.6 kcal/mol. Although our FF can give three reasonable curves, the greater error can be found on HB2. Obviously, the equilibrium distance is decreased by about 0.2 Å, which is very similar with that in the crystal. Despite this, the curve from the FF possesses a good shape like that from DFT as shown in

 </xref>d. This might be why our FF can give a good bulk modulus at the same time of obtaining a smaller volume.
