<p>Obviously, with the increase in Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doping concentration, the shape of the BASO:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> emission spectral curve varies greatly. The BASO:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> emission spectra consist of two emission peaks located at 500 and 580 nm. The intensities of the two emission peaks are close. With the increase in Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ionic concentration, the intensities of emission peaks located at 500 and 580 nm increase simultaneously. The intensity difference of the two emission peaks becomes larger and larger to the extent that we can only observe one main emission peak located at 580 nm in the emission spectrum of BASO:0.7Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. To research the luminescence characteristics of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in the BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> material, we test the low-temperature excitation and emission spectra. In the state of low temperature, the lattice vibration and the energy exchange between Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions have a small influence on the transition emission of luminescent ions, which, to some extent, can separate the emission spectra of luminescent ions located at different lattice sites. In

 </xref>c, the emission spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> in room temperature consists of a main emission peak and a weak peak located at 500 nm. Obviously, in a low temperature of 83 K, the emission spectra of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> consist of two emission peaks located at 505 and 580 nm, whose intensities are close. This indicates that two kinds of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ionic luminescence center exist in BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, whose emission peaks are located at 500 and 580 nm. According to Van Uitert theory, we can assume that the 5d orbital energy level of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion in the same material is mainly affected by the surrounding atom coordination number. In the BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> material, the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion has only two coordination numbers (8 and 9). Thus, two different emission wavelengths can possibly be produced. For this purpose, we analyze the luminescence characteristics of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions located at different lattice sites with the following equation

 <italic>E</italic> is the position of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> emission peak, whose unit is cm

 <italic>Q</italic> is the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> energy level difference between d orbital and 4f orbital for the free ion,

 <sub>a</sub> is the electronic affinity of the coordination atom, 
 <italic>n</italic> is the coordination number of the activated ion, and 
 <italic>r</italic> is the radius of the matrix cation substituted by the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion. For the BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> material, the coordination atom O is affected by SiO
 <sub>4</sub> and AlO
 <sub>4</sub> together. The value of

 <sub>a</sub> will change. According to the equation above, in the situation of the same 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> value, when 
 <italic>n</italic> is larger, the value of 
 <italic>E</italic> is larger, and the corresponding emission wavelength is smaller. Therefore, the emission peak at 580 nm should be generated by the eight-coordinated Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion. Therefore, we can estimate the value of the affinity energy of O in the material according to the emission peak at 580 nm (the activated ion is Eu

 <sup>–1</sup> is obtained, which corresponds to the 500 nm emission peak position of the BASO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> emission spectrum. This explains that there are two kinds of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion luminescent center in the material. The 500 and 580 nm emission peaks in the emission spectrum correspond to the nine-coordinated and eight-coordinated Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion luminescent center, respectively.
