<p>To show the resolution of the multi-channel THz radar system, the range profiles and azimuth profiles of the right corner reflector in three ISAR images and simulation results of an ideal point target under the same system parameters are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02330-f008">Figure 8</xref>. It can be seen that the theoretical range resolution and azimuth resolution are 2.66 cm and 8.65 mm with no use of data window, respectively. The actual range resolutions of three received channels are 2.67 cm, 2.67 cm, and 2.85 cm, and the corresponding azimuth resolutions are 8.74 mm, 8.87 mm and 8.61 mm respectively, which are very close to the theoretical value.
