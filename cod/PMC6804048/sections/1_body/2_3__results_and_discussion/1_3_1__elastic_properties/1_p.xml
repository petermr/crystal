<p>The calculated lattice parameters are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03217-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> where they are compared with the values reported in the literature. There is good agreement, as the mean deviation of all the lattice parameters is about 0.6%. The results for the independent elastic constants (C
 <sub>ij</sub>); bulk moduli (B) from elastic constants, according to the Voigt–Reuss–Hill scheme; and bulk moduli and first pressure derivatives of bulk moduli (B
 <sup>’</sup>) from the B–M EOS for all intermetallic phases and elements of this study, are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03217-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03217-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> the calculated values of the shear (G) and Young’s (E) moduli are reported. It was confirmed that the mechanical stability criteria [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] were met for all compounds. The elastic constants were in good agreement with the experimental data for the pure elements [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-materials-12-03217" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To the authors’ knowledge no data exists for the ternary intermetallics. Comparing the bulk moduli obtained from the VRH approximation and the B–M EOS fitting of all the phases, it can be seen that they were in good agreement, with the maximum deviation between them being about 7% for the Ti
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>Al.
