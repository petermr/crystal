<p>Two types of reactors including conversional STR and RPB were used for the mixing of the reactants for precipitation of the precursors during the preparation of GdBO
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> microparticles. The mixture of the reactants was allowed to react at room temperature in an STR or an RPB reactor for a certain time (in RPB for 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min, respectively, and in STR for 2 h). After that, the precipitations were annealed at 1200 Â°C for 4 h under air conditions to obtain particles with good crystallinity. The main chemical reaction in the solution can be described as follows

 </xref>a shows the XRD patterns of the products from the RPB route by reacting in the RPB reactor for various times from 20 to 50 min. It was noted that the reaction time did not have significant effects on the crystal form of final products, which was attributed to the combination of the fillers and the strong centrifugal force in the RPB reactor. The liquid stream of the reactants is quickly cut into smaller liquid films and droplets,

 </xref>b shows the comparison of XRD patterns for samples RPB-20min and STR-2h. Although the reaction time in RPB is only 1/6 of that in STR, the two samples obtained from both RPB and STR routes exhibited similar crystal structures, which are in good agreement with the standard patterns of GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> crystal (JCPDS no. 74-1932). No significant impurity peaks were observed, indicating that the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions were completely embedded into the GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> host lattices without significant effect on the crystal structures of the GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> lattices. The XRD data were further analyzed to calculate the unit cell parameters, which are shown in

The cell parameters of the RPB-20min product are significantly closer to the unit cell parameters of the standard GdBO
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> = 3.829, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 8.89) than that of the STR-2h product. These results were attributed to the enhanced mixing characteristics of the RPB reactor, which made the doping ions distribute more uniformly in the matrix lattices than those formed in conversional STR. The doping ions of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> uniformly replace the Gd
 <sup>3+</sup> in the matrix lattice and the doping ratio is relatively low (10 atom %) so that the doping of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions has no significant effect on the formation of the host crystal form.
