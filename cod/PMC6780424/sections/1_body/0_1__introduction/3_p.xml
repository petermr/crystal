<p>To this end, we developed an

 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-09-01251" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and extended its computational capability by improving the codeâ€™s parallel calculation efficiency. We performed shock wave simulation tests on 11 types of energetic single crystals, with each simulated model composed of ~1000 atoms. On the basis of the calculations, we proposed a theoretical indicator to characterize the shock wave sensitivity of energetic single crystals, which is expected to be useful for the evaluation and adjustment of the shock sensitivity of novel EMs. We also revealed the shock reaction initiation mechanism, found factors that can inhibit the shock sensitivity of EMs and provided theoretical rules for synthesizing novel EMs with low shock sensitivity.
