<p>Mode shapes of the central-supported DRG working at ~26 kHz (ring width, radius step, anchor radius and ring number are 10 μm, 70 μm, 1 mm, and 15, respectively) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f013">Figure 13</xref>. As is the same with the free vibrating DRG, the mode shapes obtained by the two methods are completely identical.
