<p>The compounds obtained after a post-annealing treatment at 600 °C, but using variable oxygen partial pressures, has shown that the particles of WO
 <sub>3</sub> are very sensitive to the synthesis atmosphere, i.e., their chemical composition (W/O ratio), their crystallite size, their crystallographic structure and their optical properties. Indeed, a very slight change in the oxygen concentration in the synthesis atmosphere drastically impacts the tungsten oxide physico-chemical properties. The sample with a monoclinic structure obtained after an annealing treatment at 10
 <sup>−2</sup> bar is very clear colored, and has an average reflection of about 60% (average percentage of reflection in the visible range from 400 to 800 nm) in the visible range and 20% in the infrared range, whereas the sample obtained after an annealing treatment at 10
 <sup>−4</sup> bar is very dark colored, with an average visible reflection of less than 5%, with a pseudo-cubic structure. In the next part, the photochromic behavior of the as-prepared samples is tested.
