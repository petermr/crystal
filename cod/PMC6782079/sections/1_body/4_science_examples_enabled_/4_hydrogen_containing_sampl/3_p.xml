<p>Hydrogen has three isotopes. The most common are protium (
 <sup>1</sup>H) and deuterium (
 <sup>2</sup>H). The most abundant, protium (often called hydrogen), has a very large incoherent scattering cross section for neutrons and as a result contributes a large source of wavelength and energy-dependent background. On the other hand, deuterium has negligible incoherent scattering, making it ideal for diffraction work. The two isotopes protium and deuterium also have negative and positive scattering lengths of −3.742 and 6.674 fm, respectively. This means partial substitution in a site in the right ratio can cancel the nuclear density of a specific site. It is often expensive to deuterate materials and sometimes there are also changes in the chemistry depending on which isotope is used. As a result, being able to study the materials without deuteration is desirable. An extensive review has recently been published on the topic by Wilson
