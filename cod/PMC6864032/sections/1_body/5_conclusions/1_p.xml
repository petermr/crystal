<p id="Par18">Because of its similarity with Martian lava flows Theo’s Flow has always been regarded as the analogue to be used for interpreting magmatic processes on Mars. The 120 m-thick Theo’s lava pile has always been considered the result of one single eruptive event, a rather unusual phenomenon on Earth but commonly accepted for Mars. However, the inconsistencies between cooling rate and temperature estimates from petrographic/textural evidence (fast cooling rates 3–6 °C/h) and from geothermometric data (slow cooling rates 0.1 °C/h) led several authors
