Recently there has been great interest in measuring samples that have a rather large absorption cross section due to exciting quantum phenomena, such as topological insulators, Weyl metals and Kitaev spin liquids which are observed in heavier transition-metal-containing compounds such as Ru, Rh, Os, Ir

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb36"> ▸</xref>). Owing to the high intensity offered by the source and the increased detector coverage from the upgrade, it is now feasible to study somewhat higher absorbing samples using thinner (3 mm diameter) or annular cans (1 mm annulus). However, data correction for such cases is still under development. The following are a few additional scientific examples that take advantage of the high intensity and resolution of this instrument.
