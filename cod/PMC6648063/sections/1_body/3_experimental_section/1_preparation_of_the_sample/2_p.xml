<p>The abovementioned material as the stoichiometric ratio of the target compound was weighed accurately. H
 <sub>3</sub>BO
 <sub>3</sub> (5 mol % of Ba element) was added as the co-solvent. The weighing raw material was placed into an agate mortar, ground, and blended for 15 min. The intensively mixed raw material was placed into an alumina crucible. Then, the crucible with the sample was put into a big crucible filled with activated carbon. The reaction temperature was 1653 K. The sample was calcined in the furnace in 1653 K for 6 h. After the reaction, the sample was cooled to room temperature in the furnace. The obtained samples were ground into powder for the following measurement.
