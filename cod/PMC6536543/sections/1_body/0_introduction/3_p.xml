<p id="Par4">Tilleyite is a naturally-occurring calcium silicate-carbonate mineral that conforms well with the chemical formula Ca
 <sub>5</sub>(Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>)(CO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, but some minor substitution of other elements such as Al, Mg or F could occur
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. It is therefore the most carbonated compound of the calcium silicate-carbonate family. The existence of this mineral was firstly reported by Larsen and Durham in 1933 from contact altered limestones at Crestmore quarries, California, USA
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. The monoclinic crystal structure of tilleyite was firstly determined by Smith
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> and later refined by Louisnathan and Smith
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, and Grice
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. The structure contains the following atom-centered oxygen polyhedra as building blocks: [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] triangles, [SiO
 <sub>4</sub>] tetrahedra forming disilicate [Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>] units, and five irregular polyhedra with different coordination spheres for Ca atoms (20% are octahedrally coordinated, 60% are forming 7-fold-coordinated capped octahedra and 20% are forming distorted cubes). It is envisaged that the flexibility of the bridging Si–O–Si dihedral angle of the disilicate group upon compression could lead to an increase of the coordination number of the Ca atoms and the transition to a denser phase.
