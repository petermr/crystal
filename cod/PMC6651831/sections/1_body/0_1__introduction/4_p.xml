<p>In this study, anisotropic material properties were applied to the component phase of fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites. A mathematical model was established for predicting the effective material properties and thermoelectric cooling capacities of the composite. Finite element simulations were conducted to validate the mathematical model. A case study was conducted on a fibrous composite material containing Copper fibers and an anisotropic Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> matrix, where the possible aggregate (anisotropic) properties for Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> were calculated and applied into the component phase. The influence of the material anisotropy and the material property axis alignment in the composite were then discussed with respect to the maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T and maximum cooling capacity of the composites. In the next step, the cooling performances of both the layered and the fibrous composites were compared. The thermoelectric properties of three representative composites, which were Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub>/Copper, In
 <sub>4</sub>Se
 <sub>2.25</sub>/Copper, and SnSe/Copper, were applied into the component phase of the composites under different material property axis alignment configurations and extreme aggregate properties of the anisotropic component. The influence of material anisotropy on the enhancement of the maximum cooling capacity and maximum Z
 <sub>trans</sub>T of the transverse thermoelectric composites was demonstrated. The cooling capacities of the layered and fibrous composites were also compared. The derived mathematical model can serve as an efficient tool for selecting high-performance fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites, while the comparison between fibrous and layered thermoelectric composites can inspire and assist thermoelectric researchers in designing higher performance thermoelectric devices.
