 </xref>a shows the two-dimensional thermoluminescence curves of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,
 <italic>y</italic>Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> (
 <italic>y</italic> = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40). With the increase in Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration, the intensity of persistent luminescence increases gradually. When 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.10, the thermoluminescence curve reaches the maximum. After continuously adding Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, the intensity of thermoluminescence decreases with it. The possible reason may be the concentration quenching owing to the excessive Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> concentration. The storage energy returns to the ground state in the form of non-radiative transitions. Besides, although the persistent luminescence of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> can be detected, its persistent luminescence property is poor. The thermoluminescence curve shape of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is similar to that of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,
 <italic>y</italic>Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>a. Besides, with the addition of Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> , the peak edge of thermoluminescence slightly moves to the high temperature, which indicates that adding Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions not only can increase the amount of traps in BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> but also can interact and increase the deepness of traps to some extent.
