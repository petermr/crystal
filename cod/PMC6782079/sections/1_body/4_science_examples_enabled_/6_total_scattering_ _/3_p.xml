<p>Local atomic structure studies and combined diffraction and PDF studies are primary missions of the Nanoscale Ordered Materials Diffractometer (NOMAD) (Neuefeind 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> ▸</xref>) and the proposed DISCOVER beamlines at the SNS (Calder 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> ▸</xref>). However, with its ability to measure PDF data up to over 100 Å in real space, POWGEN fills an important need for combined high-resolution Bragg scattering and disordered crystalline PDF studies, particularly when intermediate length scales (30–100 Å or more) are of interest. This has been demonstrated in our study of the nanoscale cation ordering in LiMn
 <sub>1.5</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> lithium-ion battery spinel samples, where the determined size of Mn and Ni cation ordered domains distinguishes samples with different charge/discharge rate capabilities (Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb23"> ▸</xref>). In addition to cation or anion chemical short-range-order studies, potential applications include the study of charge and orbital ordered domains, detailed structural analysis of conversion or topochemical reactions, the nature of displacive phase transitions, and nanocrystallite studies including particle size/shape effects. Nonetheless, sample size requirements and the primary mission of the instrument provide some constraints on these potential applications. Expanded 
 <italic>Q</italic> range (increased real-space resolution) and increased 
 <italic>Q</italic> resolution (expanded real-space range) are possible at POWGEN by combining data from several center wavelength measurements. A more detailed characterization of POWGEN’s PDF capabilities will be presented in a future contribution.
