<p>EPR was chosen to demonstrate the difference in tungsten–oxygen stoichiometry between the yellow, the blue and the black samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01555-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At room temperature, the EPR spectrum of the sample annealed under argon (black) exhibits a narrow (peak-to-peak linewidth 0.6 mT) and intense symmetrical resonance line with Lorentzian shape. This isotropic EPR signal with g-factor, g = 2.0026 ± 0.0002, close to the value of the free electron (g
 <sub>e</sub> = 2.0023) may be associated with conduction electrons rather than paramagnetic centres (such as electron trapped at oxygen vacancy) which normally exhibit anisotropic signals (axial or orthorhombic). At a low temperature (5 K), additional weak orthorhombic signals are detected at higher magnetic fields (350–420 mT region). These last EPR signals characterized by g-values close to 1.7 may be due to W
 <sup>5+</sup> (d
 <sup>1</sup>) ions in distorted environments, most likely located close to the crystallite surface [
