<p id="Par14">The above results all suggest that an irreversible morphology and/or structural change in the catalyst is not the underlying cause of the enhanced catalytic performance displayed by 1Tâ€²-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub>. Hence, to further investigate the underlying activation processes and to explore potential reaction pathways, we studied the electronic structure of these molecules and their intermediate adducts using density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations.
