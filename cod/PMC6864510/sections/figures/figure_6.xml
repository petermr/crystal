  <p>a) Energy‐level diagram of the typical excitonic and band‐to‐band transitions of 2D lead halide perovskites (FC = free carrier; FE = free exciton; GS = ground state). Colored arrows indicate absorption or PL, and the black arrow represents nonradiative relaxation. Reproduced with permission.

   <italic>n</italic> = 1 and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 nanoplatelets in toluene, highlighting the changes that occur when the halide (X) changes from Cl to Br to I and when the metal changes from Pb to Sn. Reproduced with permission.
