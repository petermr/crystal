<p>Single crystal neutron diffraction was performed on the Four-Circle Diffractometer (HB-3A) at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Due to the large neutron absorption coefficient of Eu, a relatively small single crystal (∼0.8 × 0.4 × 0.02 mm
 <sup>3</sup>) was selected and mounted on an aluminum pin. The measurement was carried out between 4 and 50 K with an incident neutron wavelength of 1.550 Å from a bent perfect Si-220 monochromator. Absorption corrections were applied using the PLATON software.
