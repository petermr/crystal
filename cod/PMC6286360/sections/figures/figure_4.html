 <caption> Characterization of 3D-TPE-COF. a N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of 3D-TPE-COF at 77 K. The inset is the pore size distribution of 3D-TPE-COF calculated from the quenched solid density functional theory; b CO 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of 3D-TPE-COF at 273 K and 298 K; c PXRD patterns of 3D-TPE-COF after treatment in different solvents for 24 h; d solid-state fluorescence spectrum of 3D-TPE-COF (λ ex = 450 nm). The inset is the photograph of 3D-TPE-COF powders under UV light irradiation </caption>
