 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref>. From, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> it is evident that there is a elongation in the lattice parameter along 
 <italic>b</italic> axis with the decrease in temperature. Contrary to 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0, it is observed that the nuclear peak profile in the vicinity of 24° comprising(011), (101), and (−101) nuclear Bragg peaks clearly gets enhanced in intensity at 2 K. Since no extra magnetic reflections with significant intensity are observed, the magnetic structure can be assumed to coincide with the crystal structure and propagation vector

  <italic>k</italic>
 </bold> = (000) may be used to model the structure. Thus, using the formalism of propagation vectors in conjunction with the irreducible representation analysis as described in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>, the magnetic reducible representation for the magnetic atoms can be decomposed as a direct sum of irreducible representations. For the refinement of the magnetic structure, the symmetry elements and basis vectors of the irreducible representations (Γ) for magnetic Ni (Re) atom were obtained using 
 <italic>BasIre</italic>p
 <italic>s</italic> program available within the FullProf suite, using the propagation vector 
 <bold>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </bold> = (000). It is observed that the magnetic representation of Ni (Re) ion comprises two irreducible representations Γ = Γ
 <sub>1</sub> + Γ
 <sub>3</sub>. The two Γ values were tested sequentially with the measured pattern at 2 K and we could refine the magnetic structure satisfactorily using the basis vectors of Γ
 <sub>1</sub>. Although using this same representation, a collection of peaks at around 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 47° shows magnetic contributions, the magnetic structure factor turns out to be less than 1% of the nuclear intensity with magnetic form factor for Ni

 <sup>+</sup> being around 0.7 at this Q-value, which hinders the accurate estimation of the magnetic structure from this peak. Thus the most probable magnetic structure can be estimated from the peak near 24° using the basis vectors of Γ
 <sub>1</sub>. It was found that the Ni (Re) moments lie predominantly along negative (positive) 
 <italic>b</italic> direction with a very small canting, which could not be resolved within the measuring capability. Hence, the moments were constrained along 
 <italic>b</italic> direction and refined. The obtained moments on Ni and Re are −2.0 (4)
