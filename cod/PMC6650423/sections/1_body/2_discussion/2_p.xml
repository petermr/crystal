<p id="Par13">Our results shed light on the pseudogap physics. Nematicity in the pseudogap phase is universal regardless of the number of CuO
 <sub>2</sub> layers per primitive cell. Moreover, the diagonal nematicity in Hg1201, observed in this study for the first time, is associated with the

 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> representation, in sharp contrast to the CDW order along the bond direction (
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>1
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub>), which demonstrates that the nematicity is not a precursor of the CDW. Notice that in other cuprates such as YBCO and Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Sr
 <sub>2</sub>CaCu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8+

 </sub>, nematicity and CDW develop along the same bond direction and the precursor issue has not been clear.
