<p id="Par8">A summary of the experimental and fitted signals at 300 K with satisfactory agreement observed for all the data sets is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Importantly, both neutron and X-ray PDFs are reproduced over the entire distance ranges and the calculated 3D diffuse scattering (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1;</xref> Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) provides a close match to the experimental data. Not only the much-studied characteristic shapes near the Bragg reflections (i.e., butterfly for 
 <italic>h</italic>00 and ellipsoidal for 
 <italic>hh</italic>0) are reproduced but also the weak diffuse peaks at ½
 <italic>hkl</italic> (
 <italic>h</italic> = 2
 <italic>n</italic> + 1, 
 <italic>k</italic> = 2
 <italic>n</italic> + 1, 
 <italic>l</italic> = 2
 <italic>n</italic>) positions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and the overall 
 <italic>Q</italic>-dependence of the diffuse intensity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Similar high-quality fits were obtained for 200 K.
