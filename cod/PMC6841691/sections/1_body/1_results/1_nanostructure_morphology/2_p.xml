 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref> shows the MC/MD evolved structure from a perspective view for systems evolved for 15 and 50 MC swaps. It can be viewed that the SRCs rich is Zr and Hf have evolved perpendicular to all the three principal crystallographic &lt;1 0 0&gt; type directions. These interconnected SRCs have created isolated Ta and Nb rich regions which look like nano-scale cuboid-like structures. As the MC/MD swaps proceed from 15 to 50 swaps, it is found that the nature and morphology of the SRCs present in the system largely remains similar. The only significant difference that could be found here is in the coarsening of the nodal regions of SRCs where 2–3 SRCs meet each other. The change of enthalpy of the evolving structure with respect to the initial random structure during MC/MD moves is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. The energy of the evolving structures reduces rapidly by 60 m eV/atom within first 10 MC swaps and by 80 m eV/atom by 15 MC swaps. After this, the rate of change of energy of the structure becomes small, only by 15 m eV/atom more until 50 MC swaps. This is also in accordance with the relative stability of the morphology of the structure after 15 MC swaps shown in Fig.
