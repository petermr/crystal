<p>Here we have prepared ZnO nanospike cross sections using the geometric shadow-FIB technique. The ZnO nanospikes were embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix by electron-beam-induced decomposition of an organic precursor. Several regions of the lamella were thinned to expose different nanospikes for HRTEM investigations. This enabled the direct observation and identification of two types of twin boundary in the ZnO nanospikes which were not observed during plan-view examination.</p>
