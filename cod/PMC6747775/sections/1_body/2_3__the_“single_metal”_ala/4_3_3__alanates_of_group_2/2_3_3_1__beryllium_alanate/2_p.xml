<p>Only a few theoretical works on BeAlH
 <sub>5</sub> have been published. Klaveness et al. reported two calculated structures of BeAlH
 <sub>5</sub>; the low and high-pressure phases, namely, the α and β phases [

 <sub>5</sub> could be stable at ambient conditions in that work. Later, Santhosh et al., also by first-principle calculations, found that the α-BeAlH
 <sub>5</sub> phase could be stable at ambient (

 <italic>T</italic>) conditions [
 <xref rid="B193-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. The calculated α-BeAlH
 <sub>5</sub> phase consisted of alternating sheets of corner-sharing (AlH
 <sub>6</sub>) octahedra and chains of corner-sharing (BeH
 <sub>4</sub>) tetrahedra. On the other hand, the calculated β-BeAlH
 <sub>5</sub> phase only consisted of chains of corner-sharing (AlH
 <sub>6</sub>) octahedra (
