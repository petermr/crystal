<p>As a second proposal, the total area of applying the piezoelectric transducers at each station is maximized to the largest available area at the station which is 9 times the area used in the first proposal as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219373.g014">Fig 14</xref>. The total area in this proposal is 13 m2 containing 6210 piezoelectric QB220-503YB transducers producing about 0.22 watt in one hour and to make this amount of energy beneficial the area of the application at this proposal needs to be maximized to at least with 273 transducers units to produce energy that can be used in lighting 1 LED street lamp for 1 hour. The total cost of the 273 transducer units at each station is about 2,184,273$ which is also very high cost compared to the amount of the energy produced from them.
