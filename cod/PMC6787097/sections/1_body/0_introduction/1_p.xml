<p id="Par2">Luminescent materials produced by natural minerals have the advantages of low production cost, simple in preparation and wide applicability. Many researchers at home and abroad have conducted significant research on it. However, natural minerals contain luminescence quenching impurities, which affect the luminescence characteristics of minerals, and become difficult in the field of research. Modern mineralogy shows that these impurities do not all cause luminescence quenching and can be fully utilized. If rare- earth ions can be added into the natural mineral to improve the luminescence properties, the utilization of the natural minerals can be significantly improved. The most abundant of earth minerals is silicate minerals. The structures of a variety of silicates and metal cation bonds impart silicate-based rare-earth luminescent materials with good chemical stability and thermal stability, therefore, become a widely used luminescent material matrix

 <italic>et al</italic>. pointed out that there is a strong special emission band in the feldspar doped with Ga, In and Ti, such that the luminous intensity is increased by more than 100 times

 <italic>et al</italic>. found that the lowest excited state of the impurity center of the alkaline feldspar is related to the excited state of P, and the higher excited state is related to oxygen

It has been reported that the luminescence method utilizing a synchrotron can potentially provide several means to firmly establish the all-optical characteristics of the naturally produced broad-band gap luminescence system, which is essential for the development of its radiation dosimetric properties

 <italic>et al</italic>. studied the luminescent properties of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> doped natural albite phosphors and obtained high-quality fluorescent materials with high purity in the orange-red region. The mineral albite used in this work contains a small amount of Eu, however it can not be used as a luminescent center in the natural state. It is well known that the energy transfer of Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> is very effective because their energy level distributions have a large overlap. We use this feature to achieve the energy transfer of Tb → Eu by doping Tb into albite, which causes the luminescence of Eu. By changing the concentration of terbium, phosphors emitting different fluorescent colors are obtained.
