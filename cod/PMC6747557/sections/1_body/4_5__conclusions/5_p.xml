<p>(4) In the image of the lg
 <italic>I</italic>-lg
 <italic>E</italic> coordinate system, after segmentation fitting, the slopes of the conductivity curves of the four materials in the T1 region are very close to 1, which is almost the same as the theoretical value; the slope value range of the T2 region is 2-4, indicating that there is an SCLC effect in this region; and the slope of the conductance characteristic curve of the T3 region is much lower than that of the curve in the T2 region, which may be because the region is not filled with traps. Since the further improvement of the electric field strength applied in the non-ohmic region stimulates the deeper trap of the dielectric material, the carrier again enters the trapping process, resulting in the slope of the T3 region being smaller than the slope of the conductance characteristic curve of the T2 region.
