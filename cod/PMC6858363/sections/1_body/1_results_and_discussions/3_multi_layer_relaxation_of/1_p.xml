 </sup> the electron (density) corrugation, some of the atoms would have to rise upward in the [410] direction. Thus, consistent with the (A-B and C-D) contraction of the [100] atoms, the 16 relaxed surface layers measure 6.518 Å thick (0.037 Å less than the 6.555 Å thick 16 bulk-truncated surface layers, cf., Table
