<p>Since the discovery of stishovite (Chao et al., 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1962</xref>; Stishov &amp; Popova, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">1961</xref>), it is well known that with increasing pressure (between 8 and approximately 30 GPa) most crustal silicates undergo phase transformations to new structures with sixfold coordinated silicon (Finger &amp; Hazen, 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). In the Earth, this transformation is achieved below 670‐km depth. This is however usually not observed in Mg
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>4</sub> since all high‐pressure polymorphs known of olivine involve fourfold coordinated silicon. Since this characteristic (silicon in sixfold coordination in the crystal structure model) was critical in the identification of the phase, we decided to carry on an ELNES characterization at the O K‐edge, which did confirm the presence of sixfold coordinated silicon. The structure model obtained from the structure refinement, which corresponds to Anh‐B, is thus in agreement with all our observations. It also fully explains the chemical composition measured since, starting from an olivine composition, the formation of Anh‐B leads to an excess of silica (equation

 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). At the pressure considered here, the thin silica layer observed on one side of the lamella is likely stishovite, although we have not checked the crystal structure.
