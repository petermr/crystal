<p>We design a comparative experiment as follows. We use the ROS platform as a control platform to control the delivery robot motion along the reference trajectory, and we obtain the coordinates of the UWB positioning system as well as those of the improved odometer positioning method. When the improved odometer positioning method is used, the heading angle of the robot must be calculated and measured by the IMU. After obtaining two sets of coordinates, the EKF fusion algorithm is used to fuse the data in order to verify the optimization of accuracy and stability. The diameter of the drive wheel of the delivery robot is 12 cm, and the distance between the left and right wheels is 34 cm.</p>
