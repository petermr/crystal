Single crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that the partial substitution of Ru by Mn results in symmetry change from orthorhombic to tetragonal due to the removal of octahedral rotation. Both electrical and magnetic properties are changed as well. For

 <sub class="sub">10</sub> an excellent material system to study ferromagnetic semiconducting properties. One of remarkable features is its linear negative MR observed in a wide temperature and field range in all current and field configurations. Such behavior may be explained by considering spin exchange interactions between localized states, which likely increases with increasing Mn doping. Our results shed important insights for linear MR particularly in the case of LNMR.
