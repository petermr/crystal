<p>The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility was measured under an external field of 500 Oe from 2 to 300 K. A transition to an antiferromagnetic state (i.e., 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub>) is seen at around 30 K. The larger magnetic susceptibility in the perpendicular field also indicates the anisotropic ordered magnetism in EuSn
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>, i.e., that ferromagnetic ordering is preferred within the 
 <italic>ab</italic>-plane rather than along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. At temperatures higher than 30 K, classic Curie–Weiss behavior is observed.
