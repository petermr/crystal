 <caption> Energy frameworks in the crystal structure of 1 a . Green, red, and blue bars represent dispersion, electrostatic, and total interaction energies accordingly. The thickest bars among the total intermolecular interaction energies correspond to energy of −63.8 kJ/mol and thin bars to energies within the range −10 to −12 kJ/mol. Energies with a magnitude less than −10 kJ/mol have been omitted. Views along the π -stacking direction [100] ( left) and along [001] ( right). </caption>
