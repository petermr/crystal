<p id="Par5">The amount of interlayer crystal water in Na-bir can vary depending on its surrounding environment, leading to the changes of its interlayer distance and structure. These Na-bir structures are essentially metastable because the water contents in the structure are reversibly changed as indicated in Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. From the Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, hydrated Na-bir is estimated to have ~8 wt% of crystal water and its Na content reaches 6 wt% based on Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), giving the formula Na
 <sub>0.27</sub>MnO
 <sub>2</sub>·0.54H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Meanwhile, partially dehydrated Na-bir has less amount of crystal water up to 0.7 wt%, finally corresponding to the stoichiometric composition of Na
 <sub>0.27</sub>MnO
 <sub>2</sub>·0.09H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Structural details of both samples were determined by Rietveld refinement as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>. The layered structure of hydrated Na-bir retains the 
 <italic>R</italic>-3m space group with a large 
 <italic>c</italic> lattice parameter of about 21.739(6) Å. After dehydration, the main peak shifts toward higher angle, and peak broadening concurrently occurs, which is consistent with an increasing disorder in MnO
 <sub>6</sub> slab, as well as the appearance of the spinel-like phase. While the 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> lattice parameters of both samples are quite similar, the 
 <italic>c</italic> lattice parameter of the partially dehydrated sample decreases down to about 16.95(1) Å because of the reduced crystal water content and the resultant contraction of Na layer. The refinement results also demonstrate that Mn atoms occupy two different sites, 3a and 6c in partially dehydrated Na-bir but only the 3a site in hydrated Na-bir (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The migration of Mn from 3a to 6c site in partially dehydrated Na-bir results from the removal of crystal water. Oxygen and crystal water partially present in this layered structure coordinates the Mn atoms in 6c sites which are tetrahedral, thereby assembling a spinel-like phase. The occupancy of Mn at 6c (0.0, 0.0, 0.112(3)) is 0.14(1), meaning that about 28% of Mn contribute to forming the spinel-like phase in partially dehydrated Na-bir. Because the Mn atoms at the tetrahedral sites are located parallel to the oxygens, the z positions of Mn and O at 6c sites are deviated from those of conventional layered structures

 </sup>. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) shows that hydrated Na-bir exhibits peaks at ~575–585 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and at ~640–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> arising from the Mn–O bond stretching vibration in the basal plane of [MnO
 <sub>6</sub>] laminates. Another peak discernible at ~640–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is very prominent as the sole observable signal in partially dehydrated Na-bir, which can be attributed to the A1g mode corresponding to the Mn–O breathing vibration of tetrahedrally coordinated Mn ions

 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d–n</xref>, both Na-bir samples have a microflower-like morphology (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, h</xref>); the interlayer distances of the hydrated and partially dehydrated Na-bir were measured to be 7.27 and 5.55 Å, respectively. Fast Fourier transforms (FFT) of separate regions in the TEM image of partially dehydrated Na-bir identify both layered phases and spinel-like phases, thus demonstrating the remarkable topotactic transformation to spinel-like phases associated with the layer-to-interlayer migration of Mn ions upon dehydration. Consequently, depending on the crystal water content, Na-bir possesses either only the layered phase or both the layered and spinel-like phase.
