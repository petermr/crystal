<p>Mutual interplay between localized and itinerant degrees of freedom is a key issue in strongly correlated systems such as heavy fermions (

 </xref>). What happens when these two types of correlated carriers coexist, however, is largely uncharted territory, with no obvious guiding principles. Our experimental result, where both real and reciprocal space manifest in a single measurement, is likely to lay a new research direction in this field. The influence of the excitonic Wigner crystal on the magnetoresistive response of metallic LMO reported here is profound and is particularly notable given that it develops without a concomitant distortion of the lattice, suggesting that it is a purely electronically driven phenomenon. It turns out that the mysterious physics at

 <sub>min</sub> is driven by a type of order-by-disorder phase transition that has fascinated theorists for three decades. So far, however, the focus has been on spin systems. No one really looked at excitons as hardcore bosons, and this makes our result—a realization of such a transition in a simple transport experiment—so remarkable. Looking forward, it will be instructive to explore ways in which to detect these dark excitons directly [e.g., via low-energy electron diffraction (

  <italic>42</italic>
 </xref>) or resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>43</italic>
 </xref>)] and to investigate which other properties of LMO are influenced by their formation.
