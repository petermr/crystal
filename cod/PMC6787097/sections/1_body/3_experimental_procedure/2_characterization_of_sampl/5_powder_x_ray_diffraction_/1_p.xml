<p id="Par21">The crystal structures of all the powders were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Shimadzu XRD-7000) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA at room temperature. The detector covers an angular range 10° &lt; 2θ &lt; 105° with a counting time of 5 s per step.</p>
