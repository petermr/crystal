<p id="Par7">We modeled the PMN structure at 300 K and 200 K using atomic configurations of 40 × 40 × 40 perovskite unit cells (320,000 atoms, 16  × 16  × 16 nm), which sample interatomic distances up to 8 nm (see the Methods section). The atomic coordinates in these configurations were varied according to an RMC algorithm

 </sup> while simultaneously fitting the neutron and X-ray powder total-scattering functions; their respective real-space Fourier transforms, which represent atomic pair-distribution functions (PDF); and 3D distributions of X-ray diffuse intensity measured using a single crystal. In addition, we included the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data for Pb and Nb to provide chemical resolution. The refinements were enabled by several breakthrough developments in the RMC software and methodology which permitted efficient treatment of large atomic configurations, accurate fitting of the total-scattering data to long distances, and fitting of 3D diffuse-intensity distributions over an extended range of reciprocal space (see Methods).
