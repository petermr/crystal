<p id="Par15">A ‘box-car’ refinement procedure was followed where, at each temperature, each of the seven structural models were fitted to three regions of the PDF; 
 <italic>r</italic> = 1.50–9.36, 9.30–16.85, and 16.80–24.60 Å, to fit correlations between atoms separated by approximate First, Second, and Third Unit Cell distances, respectively. The cubic cell parameter

 <sub>iso</sub> for tetrahedrally coordinated Fe
 <sub>A</sub>, octahedral Fe

 <sub>1</sub> was set to 0. A further constraint of equal Fe
