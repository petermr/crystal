 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">108</xref> The reason for such a high EQE is the increased PL efficiency of the film due to less surface defect states caused by TOPO passivation; thus, nonradiative recombination at the surface and grain boundaries is reduced, as shown in Figure

The reason for this phenomenon is that the driving force for PL is the energy difference only, while the driving force of EL is the combination of energy difference and applied electric field, so most charges are injected into the smallest bandgap region and then recombine.
