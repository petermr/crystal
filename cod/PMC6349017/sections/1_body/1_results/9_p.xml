 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref> shows the surface-PT and adlayer-PT free energies at ZnO(101[combining macron]0). For a full discussion of those results, we refer the reader to our previous work.
 <xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Here, we simply note, that for ZnO(101[combining macron]0): (i) the rate of adlayer-PT is greater than the rate of surface-PT, (ii) the left and right hand sides (LHS and RHS) of the adlayer-PT coordinate are equivalent, and (iii) for surface-PT, the LHS [dissociated water, PHC(Zn
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup>)] is more stable than the RHS [molecular water, PHC(O
 <sub>s</sub>
 <sup>2â€“</sup>)].
