<p>In the vibrating DRG, modes of the different rings are different, meanwhile, the modes of each ring are not standard fundamental (

In the following sections, the design model and working principle of DRGs will be firstly described and then the CMS technique is introduced. Then, the calculation method based on CMS is used to calculate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of both the free vibrating and central-supported DRGs. Then, results of the mathematical modeling and FEA method are compared to verify the feasibility of the mathematical analysis method. Last, the calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes are used for calculation of the lumped mass-spring model of the DRG and the effects of geometry parameters on the lumped mass-spring parameters are investigated.
