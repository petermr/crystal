<p id="Par16">As the temperature rises, the morphologies of the three Fe nanoplates evolve with different patterns. The upper plots in the left panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> display their temperature dependent potential energies (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>p</sub>). For the three nanoplates, crystal planes with different Miller indices lead to a clear hierarchy in structural stability. According to the calculations, the averaged potential energies per atom (not shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are − 2.833, − 3.457, and − 3.668 eV/atom respectively for the initial configurations with (111), (001), and (110) surfaces. Considering that the nanoplates are as thin as three atomic layers, it is natural to find that their energy values are in the same order of the surface energies of the three corresponding crystal planes (2.58, 2.47, and 2.37 J/m
 <sup>2</sup> for (111), (001), and (110) surfaces, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]). With distinctively higher potential energies, the nanoplates with flat (111) and (001) crystal planes are not able to maintain their initial structures as constructed. They immediately transform into metastable states with curved surfaces (cf. snapshots (a) and (b) in the right panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In contrast, the (110) nanoplate presents the best structural stability. Its morphology (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) keeps invariant throughout the entire temperature region examined, which can be corroborated by the energy steadily increasing with a linear trend. As for the other two nanoplates, their shape deformations exhibit different features. The least stable (111) nanoplate turns into an irregular form instantly after relaxation (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), and this irregular geometry facilitates the progress of shrinking into a compact particle. Therefore, its potential energy periodically decreases and finally reaches the much lower level than the (001) nanoplate. However, the saddle surface of the (001) nanoplate demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b retains until it becomes irregular particle at about 200 K. The evolution of this structure with medium structural stability is accompanied by relatively mild energy change, which can be divided into four stages as demarcated by dot lines in the plots of potential energy.
