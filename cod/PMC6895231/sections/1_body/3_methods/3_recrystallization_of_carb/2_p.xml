<p id="Par38">CBZD was identified using a PANalytical Xpert PRO X-Ray Diffractometer (PANanalytical B.V., Almelo, Netherlands) with a nickel filtered CuKα (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5418 Å) source that was generated at a tube voltage of 45 kV and current of 40 mA. A PIXcel detector with a 
 <italic>θ</italic>/
 <italic>θ</italic> goniometer was used. The measurements were performed at a reflection mode between 5° and 35° at a step size of 0.0263° 2
 <italic>θ</italic> and a scan speed of 0.06734° 2
 <italic>θ</italic>. The X’Pert Data Collector software provided by PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands was used in order to analyze the diffractograms. For reproducibility purposes, triplicate measurements were performed.
