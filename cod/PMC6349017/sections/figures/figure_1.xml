  <title>Schematic representation of the Grotthuss mechanism for the transport of OH
   <sup>–</sup> (red) in water. The protons that participate in the next reaction step are shown in blue, and the hydrogen bond along which they are transferred in magenta. Only the molecules in the water “wire” along which the proton hole diffuses are shown. Each step in the mechanism is aided by fluctuations in the hydrogen bond network with the surrounding water molecules (not shown).
