 <sub>1</sub>-type As was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction method using superior experimental equipment. Since good single crystals could be found out and a good diffraction data set was obtained, the structure could be determined by the direct method (details are in the CIF file). The crystals are naturally occurring arsenic containing three percent antimony element of the homologous elements. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref> show the crystal structure projected on (010) and (001), respectively. There are eight kinds of crystallographically non-equivalent As sites (Extended Data Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). All atoms are on the mirror plane parallel to (010). The As sites repeat as -As1-As2-As2′-As1′-As3′-As4′-As4-As3-As1- along a axis, or in opposite direction. The three-connected (buckled) six-gon layer bends at the As4′-As4 or As4-As4′ positions. Structurally, eight kinds of crystallographically equivalent As sites are divided into four pairs, As1-As1′, As2-As2′, As3-As3′ and As4-As4′. This structure can also be divided into two portions like As1-As2-As2′-As1′ (yellowish green sphere in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and As3′-As4′-As4-As3 (green sphere).
