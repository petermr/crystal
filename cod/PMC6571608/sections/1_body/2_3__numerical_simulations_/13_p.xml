<p>Experimental works describing polarization gratings in PDLC (PSLC), such as Reference [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-11-00861" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], note that recording should be held at small incident angles. Besides, intensity of formation waves should be high to cross the threshold of Freedericksz transition [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-11-00861" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-11-00861" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, described conditions of polarization gratingsâ€™ formation correspond to conditions of non-linear phase gratings formation.
