 <p>In recent years, increasing efforts have been devoted to designing new functional stimuli-responsive supramolecular assemblies. Here, we present three isomeric supramolecular coordination complexes consisting of a Pd
  <sub>2</sub>L
  <sub>4</sub> stoichiometry. As shown by NMR, CD and X-ray studies, as well as DFT calculations, these complexes form cage-like structures by chiral self-sorting. Photochromic ligands derived from first generation molecular motors enable light-driven interconversion between the three isomers. Two of the isomers were able to form hostâ€“guest complexes opening up new prospects toward stimuli-controlled substrate binding and release.
