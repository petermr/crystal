<p>Fluorescence QY of phosphors was measured on a C9220-03 system (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) with a 150 W Xe monochromatic lamp and an integrating sphere. A high-intensity 365 nm UV lamp (B-100A, UVP, LLC, CA) was used to shine phosphors for optical photographs. LEDs devices were fabricated by applying a 25 wt % phosphor slurry composed of the phosphor powder and Dow Corning OE-6550 silicone on top of a blue-emitting InGaN based LED mounted in a 2835 PLCC package (Power Opto Co., Taiwan), followed by thermal curing of the LEDs package on a hot plate at 125 Â°C.</p>
