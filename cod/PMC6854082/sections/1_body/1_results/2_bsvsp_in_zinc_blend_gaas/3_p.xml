 </sup>. We further adopt this method to prove the unusual band splitting with vanishing spin polarization in GaAs (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The band structure of the effective Hamiltonian along Λ line are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. The top valence bands are two non-degenerate bands. The 
 <italic>x</italic> component of spin polarizations is zero for these non-degenerate bands, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. The 
 <italic>y</italic> and 
 <italic>z</italic> components have the same behavior. This 
 <italic>k</italic>·
 <italic>p</italic> analysis confirms our DFT results and group theory analysis. In Dresselhaus/Rashba effect, the spin polarization of the split bands arises as a consequence of the effective 
 <italic>k</italic>-dependent magnetic field experienced by electrons in the presence of SOC in an acentric environment. When the symmetry requirements unveiled by our group-theory analysis are met, however, the effect of such SOC-induced magnetic fields vanishes, thus giving rise to BSVSP effect. Our further analysis shows indeed that the SOC-induced effective magnetic fields acting on two different 
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals (e.g., 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub>) of the same atom (e.g., As) are equal in strength but opposite in direction for the k-point along the Γ-L direction, resulting in a band splitting and a net vanishing spin polarization (since local magnetic moments for different orbitals of the same atom are opposite) (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
