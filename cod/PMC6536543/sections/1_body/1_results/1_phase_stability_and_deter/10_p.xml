<p id="Par15">Theoretical DFT calculations confirm that post-tilleyite is a thermodynamically more stable structure at high-pressures. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the energy as a function of volume curves for the initial tilleyite and high-pressure post-tilleyite calculated structures. It can be clearly seen that both curves cross each other at high pressure. As shown in the enthalpy as a function of pressure graph of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> inset, the denser phase becomes more stable at 8 GPa, in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Structural data from DFT calculations are also collected in Supplementary Information. Our simulations also provide frequencies and pressure coefficients of the IR- and Raman-active optical vibrations and, interestingly, show that some low-frequency modes corresponding to the tilleyite phase become softer with increasing pressure and eventually vanish at the phase transition pressure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> of SI). Furthermore, our theoretical data predict that post-tilleyite will be dynamically unstable above 21 GPa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> of SI).
