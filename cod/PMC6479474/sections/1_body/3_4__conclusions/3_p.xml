<p>Our findings shed light on the spectral features of melamine that have been reported in analytical spectroscopic studies of melamine as contaminant. In particular, the concluded in literature superiority of NIR spectroscopy in the analysis of the samples with relatively higher content of melamine was explained.</p>
