 <caption> Average dipole moment μ N ( a) and normalized dipole moment μ N / μ max ( b) as functions of assembly size N. The results shown on both panels as triangles refer to the structural data from ref. [ 17]. The other two data sets (red rhombi and open blue squares) are taken from snapshots of the MD trajectories [ 29]. The dashed blue line on panel ( b) guides for the eye. In panel ( a), error bars are depicted for the two MD data sets. </caption>
