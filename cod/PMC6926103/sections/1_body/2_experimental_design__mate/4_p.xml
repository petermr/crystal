<p id="p0195">Each phase was optimized from a structure that was obtained using random substitution, special quasirandom structure (SQS), or substitutional search, depending on the type of structure (e.g. fcc or bcc). Since SQS's mimics well the local atomic structure of the random alloy, their electronic properties, calculable via first-principles techniques, provide a representation of the electronic structure of the alloy [
