<p>The mechanical compatibility between this material with the other cell components was determined by thermal expansion measurements in a cylindrical dense pellet (5 mm diameter × 2 mm thickness) obtained by pressing the prepared powder under 200 MPa of uniaxial pressure and sintered at 1050 °C for 12 h in air. The thermal expansion of the sintered sample was studied using a LINSEIS L75/155 °C dilatometer (Linseis Messgeraete, Selb, Germany) between 400 and 900 °C in air.</p>
