 <caption> Wavelength- and angle-dependent photoelectric properties of 1T’-WTe 2. a,b) The I–V curves of test angles at 0° and 60°, respectively, with incident wavelength varying from 500 to 750 nm. The incident power was set at 1.4 mW. c) I– V curves of different test angles (from 0° to 150°) with incident wavelength at 633 nm and power at 1.4 mW. d) Angle-resolved photosensitivity of 1T’-WTe 2 in polar coordinates (wavelength: 633 nm). </caption>
