<p>Our point of departure was the synthesis of the diquaternary SDA, shown in Figure

In this way we could make derivatives that might promote the construction of channels in the zeolite framework that would extend in more than one direction. We could convert the resulting dione to a di‐tertiary amine in one step using the Leuckart reaction.

Note that in the formation of the diamine, the isomeric possibilities (there are 3 at this step) are fixed. Individual isomers were recovered by selective recrystallization methods and their structures determined using single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction data.
