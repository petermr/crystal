<p>Essential characteristics of the corrosion resistance of nanostructures are the oxidation reaction rate and following corrosion, which entails an alteration in the concentration of substances per unit of time [
 <xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-09-01079" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The results on the corrosion resistance of nanoparticles in acid solutions are presented in order to determine the oxidation products and the rate of degradation. The choice of acids for the experiment to determine corrosion resistance was based on the fact that most electrolytes use slightly soluble acids, and if their concentration increases dramatically, nanoparticles can quickly degrade due to the accelerated oxidation process. A highly concentrated solution of sulfuric acid, which is used in most electrolytes, was used as an aggressive medium.
