<p>Hydration structures are the core structural unit for understanding the structure and physical properties of solutions. On the one hand, it is believed that the hydration shell still exists near the interface between crystal and solutions.

 </sup> On the other hand, as approaching to interfaces, water molecules may rearrange with certain order.

 </sup> It is not difficult to imagine that the hydration structure at SLI will be more complex under the two competing factors, namely, the tendency of maintaining hydration shell and the ordering tendency of water molecules. In addition to the impact on the structure, the ionic hydration shell is also the key to understand the transport of ions.
