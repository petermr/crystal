<p>At this point, one may expect that the formations of the metal-deficient species are favored because of the aforementioned depletion of destabilizing, antibonding M–S states, which correspond to the largest percentages to the net bonding capabilities. Indeed, that conclusion is in accordance with previous

 </sup> research, which implied that the presence of metal vacancies corresponds to an increase of metal cation–chalcogenide anion orbital mixing and, eventually, the stabilization of an entire defect (transition-metal chalcogenide) crystal structure. Yet, why do the nonmetal-deficient transition-metal sulfides exist? Actually, the differences between the percentage contributions of the M–S interactions in MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and those in the respective metal-deficient sulfides are rather small such that the latter rather tend to be preferred. Furthermore, electronically unfavorable situations have been identified for all metal-deficient sulfides because occupied flat bands are located at the Fermi levels in M
 <sub>31</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr
 <sub>29</sub>S
 <sub>32</sub> (see above). Thus, it may be inferred that the interplay between the occupations of flat bands at the Fermi level, which typically signify electronic instabilities, and the populations of antibonding M-d–S 3p states appears to control the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of these sulfides.
