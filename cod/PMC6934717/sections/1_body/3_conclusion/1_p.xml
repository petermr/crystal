<p id="Par21">We find that disorder-related lattice variability drives significantly different Fe Néel ordering temperatures in the stoichiometric EuFe
 <sub>2</sub>As
 <sub>2</sub> crystals, with the highly unusual result that the 
 <italic>more</italic> locally disordered crystal exhibits the 
 <italic>higher</italic> Néel point. The diffuse scattering that is seen along the [00 L] direction in X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements for the higher 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> crystal may well be the origin of the broadened specific heat peak and the suppressed superconducting dome. The surface topography and electronic structure studies show that there is a clear difference in electronic and defect structures between the two 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> crystals, with defect states dominating and elevating the LDOS for the higher 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>N</sub> ‘crystal a’. Although the two crystals have a similar number of defects, their segregation around the antiphase boundaries in ‘crystal b’ largely decreases the number of random individual defects, which may cause a higher-

  <italic>c</italic>
