<p id="Par6">In this work, the results are presented which are obtained using the alternative method for the diagnostics of the reaction zone by the electrical conductivity. Our previous investigations stated reliably the influence of the grain size for cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) of a powder density which manifests itself by the shorter reaction zone

 </sup> and the significant decrease of the maximum mass velocity for smaller grains

 </sup>. In the present work, the influence of the grain size on the time dependence of electrical conductivity was confirmed at the detonation of RDX in the whole range of densities investigated up to the maximum value.
