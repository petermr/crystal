<p>SEM investigations comprised morphological and compositional analysis [by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy] of sintered pellet and crystal samples. In addition, the morphology and particle size distribution of the starting materials was examined (

For studying sintered pellets, a piece of sample was affixed to an Al holder with melting glue (mp 150 °C) and conducting graphite paste was added to ensure electric conduction from sample to holder. Polishing was first done mechanically with SiC paper to create a flat surface, which was followed by Ar
 <sup>+</sup>-beam cross section polishing (CP) in a CP-09010 instrument from JEOL. CP was performed at a 90° angle, employing a shield from the manufacturer, and using 5.5 kV acceleration voltage for the Ar
 <sup>+</sup>-ion gun. For studying crystal samples, crystals were selected under an optical microscope and placed on the flat surface of an Al sample holder using a droplet of acetone to affix the crystals.
