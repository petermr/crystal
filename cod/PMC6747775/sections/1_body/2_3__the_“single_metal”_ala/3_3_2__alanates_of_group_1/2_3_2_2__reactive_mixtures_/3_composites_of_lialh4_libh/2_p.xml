<p>The rehydrogenation of the LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub>-LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> mixtures was proven to occur at various conditions of pressure and temperature, among them 40, 70, and 85 bar, and 350, 400, and 600 Â°C [

 <xref rid="B99-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The rehydrogenation is directed to the formation of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>, since no rehydrogenation of LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> has reported. While using NaBH
 <sub>4</sub> instead of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> conduces to similar conclusions; a two-step dehydrogenation with reduced temperature as compared with pure materials, the presence of AlB
 <sub>2</sub> after dehydrogenation, and partial hydrogenation due to the formation of NaBH
 <sub>4</sub> [
