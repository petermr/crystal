<p>As could be expected from the chemical and crystallographic results, here, the magnetic behavior is much more similar between samples than in the first batch. Nevertheless, there is still a small difference in 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>S</sub> and μ between those samples prepared at 850 and 950 °C, where they are higher when the calcination is more intense. Although the differences are now smaller, it is possible to see how those samples prepared at higher temperatures have smaller values of 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>R</sub> and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>C</sub>. It is contrary to what has been obtained for the first batch of samples. Nevertheless, it should be considered that the differences in these cases are much smaller and they may be in the error range of the measurement. Finally, the main parameters obtained from these measurements are shown in
