<p id="Par24">Single crystal aluminum (99.9995%) was cut into 1.5 mm × 2 mm × 0.5 mm rectangular plates. The plates were mechanically polished to a thickness of ~100 µm and then one edge was further electrochemically thinned to a few microns in thickness. The aluminum plate was attached onto a MEMS heater mount by conductive epoxy that can survive 500 °C high temperature. On part of the thinned edge, focused ion beam (FIB) was used to reduce the thickness of the front edge to ~2 µm by micromachining.</p>
