<p>The development of the work was complex, because quantitative comparison of the results in both types of ABs is very difficult due to the different ways they work acoustically. Therefore, for this first study on the relationship between sand movement and the change in the acoustic attenuation properties of SCAS versus classical ABs, we preferred to focus on a qualitative analysis, which may already be of interest to engineers when selecting the type of ABs to be installed in communications infrastructure depending on the type of soil.</p>
