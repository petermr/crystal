  <p>Characteristics of the chemical ordering of Mg and Nb. 
   <bold>a</bold> A schematic rendering of the rocksalt-type partial ordering of Nb and Mg, with the alternate {111} planes occupied by Nb (blue octahedra) and the Mg
   <sub>2/3</sub>Nb
   <sub>1/3</sub> (magenta octahedra) mixture, respectively. The Pb atoms are represented using yellow spheres. 
   <bold>b</bold> The Warren–Cowley (W-C) short-range order parameter
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
   </sup> for the distribution of Mg and Nb, calculated as a function of interatomic distance for the refined configuration. A characteristic length, 
   <italic>D</italic>, that corresponds to the effective size of chemically ordered regions is indicated. 
   <bold>c</bold> A 3D distribution of the local chemical short-range order parameter, 
   <italic>η</italic> (see the Methods section), which varies continuously across the regions of enhanced order. 
   <bold>d</bold> A 2D map of the local order parameter calculated from the projected 
   <italic>Z</italic>-map (see text) for the refined configuration as described in ref. 
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
   </sup>. The 
   <italic>x</italic> and 
   <italic>z</italic> axes correspond to the [001] and [110] directions, respectively. This map agrees well with its analog derived from the experimental scanning transmission electron microscopy images
