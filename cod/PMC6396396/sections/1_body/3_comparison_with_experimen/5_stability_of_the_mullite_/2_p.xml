<p>According to the SiO

 <italic>et al.</italic> (1987
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb40"> ▸</xref>) the width of the solid solution range corresponds to a vacancy concentration difference of about 0.06. The borders of the range shift to higher vacancy concentrations with increasing temperature. Close to the melting point the width of the solid solution range becomes very narrow around
