 <caption> Average length of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds l HB ( a) and average length of the close contacts l CC ( b) as functions of assembly size N. The MD data from ref. [ 29] are taken for the analysis. The blue line in panel ( a) shows the length of the hydrogen bonds as measured from the crystal cell studied by Lee et al. [ 17]. The dashed black line on panel ( a) guides for the eye. The red line in panel ( b) shows an average value for the close contacts as measured from the crystal cell studied by Lee et al. [ 17] and the red hatched field on the graph depicts the error bar above and below the average value. </caption>
