<p>Plant cultivation in horticulture, as well as phototherapy to treat physical illness, has been significantly stimulated by the emergence of efficient red and far-red light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

 </sup> For plant growth, photosynthesis requires red light radiation in the 600–690 nm range to overlap well with the respective absorption peaks of chlorophylls 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> at 662 and 642 nm.

 </sup> Particularly, plant morphogenesis encompasses the light-mediated seed germination, seedling development, and photoperiodism, which is critical to healthy plant development. On the other hand, for phototherapy, there exist several active response bands located in the red and far-red light regions: (i) 613–623 nm, (ii) 667–683 nm, and (iii) 750–772 nm.

 </sup> A growing body of evidence indicates photoacceptors in cells, like cytochrome 
 <italic>c</italic> oxidase and the terminal enzyme of mitochondrial electron transport chain, exhibit response to low-intensity red light and even near-infrared light.

 </sup> Exposure to 670 or 726 nm LEDs red light was reported to decrease the healing time in chronic ischemic ulcers in rats.

 </sup> Therefore, achievement of novel red/far-red sources would significantly promote the development of plant cultivation and phototherapy.
