<p>As mentioned in the Introduction, FeSi, RuSi, and OsSi are semiconductors. Their calculated energy gaps are given in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02710-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> in comparison with the experimental data. For comparison, energy gaps were calculated both without and with SOC at the same lattice-parameter values, given in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-02710-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It can be seen that splitting bands due to spin–orbit coupling leads to smaller values of calculated energy gaps
