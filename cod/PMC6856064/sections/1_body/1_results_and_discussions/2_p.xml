<p id="Par4">We fabricated five LED PKGs– (1) blue LED - yellow phosphor (1B-Y), (2) blue LED - green and red phosphors (1B-GR), (3) blue LED - blue, yellow and red phosphors (1B-BYR), (4) and (5) one UV and two blue LEDs - green and red phosphors (PKG-1-1UV2B-GR and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR). Two different PKGs were fabricated using 1UV2B-GR design. In the PKG-1, the wavelength of the blue LED was 452 nm, while in PKG-2, the wavelength of the blue LED was 455 nm. The structure of the final PKG of 1UV2BGR configuration was a 3 in 1- type chip in which a UV chip is placed at the center of the PKG, and two blue chips were arranged on the top and bottom (Fig.
