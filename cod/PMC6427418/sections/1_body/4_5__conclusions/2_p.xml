Thus, an important conclusion can be made that geometrical effects are neither the only nor the dominating ones influencing Poissonâ€™s ratio of the studied models. Apart from the interaction potential, the form (shape) of the inclusions and their distribution in the crystalline lattice are the key factors that also exert changes in elastic properties of these models. Thus, it is important to study other models with different types of interactions and different shapes of inclusions. Such research has been conducted and will be presented elsewhere.
