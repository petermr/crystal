 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> indicates the mean value for spherical and annular ROIs in the Derenzo images. The values of spherical ROIs are higher for the block and those of the annular ROIs are higher for the cylindrical model. This implies a lower partial loss of intensity for the new model. The SOR of 1.8-mm spheres is 0.19 and 0.34 for the block and cylindrical geometries, respectively. This value increases by increasing the source size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). There is a little kink in the SOR graph at 2.2 mm. The reason is that the spheres of 2.2 mm diameter are more extended to the peripheral area of the field of view where the spatial resolution degrades and the partial volume effect is more visible.
