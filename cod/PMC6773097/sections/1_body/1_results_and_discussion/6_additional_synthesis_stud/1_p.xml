<p>In an attempt to confirm the indications of the energy calculations that isomer I favors the formation of SSZ‐26 and isomer III SSZ‐27 experimentally, we performed a set of synthesis experiments where the two isomers (I and III) were used individually with and without seeding (Table 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It can be seen that in the case of isomer III, which shows the favourable space‐filling (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), SSZ‐27 crystallizes. The formation is even faster if there is seeding with SSZ‐27. In contrast, the other two experiments yield no SSZ‐27 and eventually form SSZ‐26 after a much longer run period (4–5 times longer). In the process of determining the crystallization requisites for reproducing the synthesis of SSZ‐27, we found that higher temperatures (170 °C) favoured SSZ‐27 over SSZ‐26. The latter is typically made at 160 °C. While the zeolite synthesis literature does describe some examples of crystallization of relatively open structures at higher temperatures, the general trend in crystallization is to produce open, metastable structures at short reaction times and lower temperatures and then zeolites with progressively higher framework density (sometimes through structure transformation

The void volumes in zeolite structures have an inverse relationship to framework density, and the framework structure of SSZ‐26, which crystallizes at the lower temperature, is in fact more open than that of SSZ‐27.
