<p id="Par4">A dimerized magnet, which has well-defined bosonic excitations called triplons, is a good starting point for realizing the bosonic topological bands

 </sup>. Because of the dominant antiferromagnetic intradimer interactions, triplons are locally formed with a finite energy gap from the singlet ground state at each dimer. The transverse and longitudinal terms of the interdimer exchange interactions induce the hopping and repulsion of the triplons, respectively
