 </xref>), except for the following distinct differences: (i) the central vacancy, which reduces the metal atom count from 145 to 144, and (ii) the profound chirality in the outermost shell(s). The crystal structure matches the model proposed by Lopez-Acevedo, especially the most recent theoretical optimizations (

 <italic class="italic">I</italic>-symmetry (the 60 Au and 60 S-C shells), resembling the traditional “football” of Asia, although the trigonal (

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) symmetry imposed by the unit cell was not shown (

  <italic class="italic">37</italic>

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (

 <sub class="sub">60</sub> and related systems, was motivated directly by the Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub> structure with 60 bridging carbonyl ligands (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
