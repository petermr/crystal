<p>Due to the transient characteristic of transient pressure testing, the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors are not negligible. Aiming at offsetting the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors, a new dynamic compensation method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with system identification theory (SIT) was proposed. The principle and theoretical basis of acceleration-induced effects was researched, then the static and dynamic acceleration-induced effects on the quartz crystal of a piezoelectric pressure sensor were analyzed by ANSYS. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, an acceleration-induced effects dynamic calibration system was built using a Machete hammer, which generates acceleration signals with different amplitudes and pulse widths. A series of tests for the 8502 piezoelectric pressure sensor were carried out, and an ARX mathematical model of acceleration-induced effects was obtained using EMD-SIT. A digital compensation filter for acceleration-induced effects was designed on the basis of this model. After compensation, the acceleration-induced effects on pressure sensors were less than 11%. Thus, the correctness, accuracy and reliability of the model were validated. The superiority of our method is that it does not affect the sensorâ€™s sensitivity and inherent frequency. At the same time, EMD-SIT was more effective than the EMD to reduce the error of the acceleration-induced effects. This method is also suitable for many other types of pressure sensors, such as piezoresistive sensors, fiber optic pressure sensors, and so on.</p>
