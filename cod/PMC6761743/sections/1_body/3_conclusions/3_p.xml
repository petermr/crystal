<p>A bonding analysis based on the −pCOHP approach demonstrated that the bonding situations in all sulfides are dominated by strong M-d–S 3p bonding interactions, besides minor, but evident, M-d–M-d interactions. The M-d–S 3p interactions are antibonding around the Fermi levels, and the occupations of these antibonding states are reduced as the metal contents of the sulfides decrease. Accordingly, it may be concluded that the subtle interplay between the populations of flat bands and antibonding M-d–S 3p states at the Fermi levels appears to control the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of the sulfides.</p>
