<p id="Par13">In summary, we observed an unknown metastable phase during the devitrification of melt spun Al-10% Sm glasses. Using an efficient genetic algorithm combined with experimental diffraction data, we found a series of similar crystal structures which have low energy and fit well with the experiment XRD. The crystalline phase with the lowest formation energy, termed 
 <italic>η</italic>-Al
 <sub>41</sub>Sm
 <sub>5</sub>, has a big tetragonal unit cell that contains 92 atoms with the stoichiometry Al
 <sub>82</sub>Sm
 <sub>10</sub>. The calculated X-ray diffraction pattern matches well with that of the experiments. 
 <italic>η</italic>-Al
 <sub>41</sub>Sm
 <sub>5</sub> is mechanically stable from phonon spectrum calculation. It is metastable with respect to phase separation into Al
 <sub>3</sub>Sm and pure Al at finite temperatures. Resolution of the atomic structure of these new metastable complex crystal phases lay the groundwork for further investigations to elucidate how different processing protocols can influence the selection and growth of different metastable crystal phases in the devitrification process. Examining the 3 metastable phases observed so far in devitrification experiments, we find a common picture emerging where complex metastable phases which appear have structures dominated by specific atomic clusters (motifs) centered about Sm atoms. This supports structure hierarchy picture of complex phase formations and suggests a possible physical mechanism where the low mobility of Sm atoms during devitrification process plays an important role in the selection of metastable crystal phases compatible with certain Sm-centered cluster motifs.
