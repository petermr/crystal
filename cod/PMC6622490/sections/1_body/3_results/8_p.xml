At each of the selected station the readings were taken at the bus stop. The bus stop stations have very poor and deteriorated structure as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219373.g012">Fig 12</xref>. The study proposes a renovation for the bus stop by applying the piezoelectric material transducers at the presented place in
