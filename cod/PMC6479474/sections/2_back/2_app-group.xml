CRYSTAL output (A–D), and with atoms wrapped to the cell (E–H). Figure S2: Comparison of the experimental ATR-IR spectrum of polycrystalline melamine (4000–2500 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> region) with the spectra calculated for periodic (3D, infinite) model of crystal lattice in harmonic approximation at B3LYP/Gatti and B3LYP/TZVP levels. Figure S3: Comparison of the experimental ATR-IR spectrum of polycrystalline melamine (2000–650 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> region) with the spectra calculated for periodic (3D, infinite) model of crystal lattice in harmonic approximation at B3LYP/Gatti and B3LYP/TZVP levels. Table S1: Projection of normal coordinates of melamine onto natural internal coordinates. Based on Potential Energy Distribution (PED) analysis carried out for single molecule model vibrationally analyzed at B3LYP-GD3BJ/SNST level.
