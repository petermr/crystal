 </sup> parametrization was selected to treat the exchange and correlation effects. PBE-GGA belongs to the so-called semilocal DFT functionals, which are known to slightly underestimate bonding strength in solids and significantly underestimate band gaps in semicinductors and insulators. However, it is numerically efficient and provides accuracy, which is sufficient for the purposes of the present study. The integration over the Brillouin zone was performed using a gamma-centered mesh with a k-points grid 6 × 6 × 6. All the calculations were carried out using the Gaussian smearing with a broadening of
