<p id="Par12">The SiO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra in both coesite-IV and coesite-V demonstrate a considerable variation in the volume (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>) and Si–O distances (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>), but they are comparable with those in stishovite, the only known silica phase with 
 <italic>hexa-</italic>coordinated silicon whose structure has been reliably and systematically studied experimentally at high pressures

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. However, the distance between atoms Si2 and Si7 is unexpectedly short (∼2.44 Å). It is by ~8% shorter than could be anticipated for the structure with the 
 <italic>hexa-</italic>coordinated silicon at ∼50 GPa (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). The reason is the highly unusual type of connection of (Si2)O
 <sub>6</sub> and (Si7)O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra—through the common face (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Such a structural element has been neither experimentally observed for any silicon compounds, nor expected for small and high-valence cations like Si
