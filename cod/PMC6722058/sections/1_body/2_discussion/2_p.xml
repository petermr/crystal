<p id="Par27">We validated the method by predicting the Au–S interface structures of 10 known thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters and the Ag–S and Ag–P interface structures of four known ligand-protected silver clusters. Furthermore, we introduced a CSE parameter to measure the goodness of generated model clusters showing a clear correlation of low CSE value to low DFT total energy. The definition of CSE enables additional terms or fitness functions including both local and global descriptors, which could relate to structure-dependent properties such as X-ray powder diffraction patterns.</p>
