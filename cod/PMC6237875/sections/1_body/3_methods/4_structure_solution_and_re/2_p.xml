<p id="Par33">In the experiment at 35.9(7) GPa, we collected 678 reflections, which were merged based on the crystal symmetry to 452 independent reflections with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>int</sub> = 5.49. At 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.8 Å, completeness of the data was 25.5%. The amount of the collected data allowed us to refine the structure only in an isotropic approximation. The resulting ratio of the number of reflections (452) and the number of parameters (97) was ~5. Two reflections were omitted from the refinement due to overlap with the diamond peaks. The final structure was refined to convergence with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 10.86%, 
 <italic>wR</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 22.80%, and GOF = 1.122 for all 452 unique reflections [
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 8.11%, 
 <italic>wR</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 20.83%, for those 332 data with 
 <italic>I</italic> &gt; 2σ(
 <italic>I</italic>)]. On a final difference Fourier map, we observed no peaks higher than 0.7 e·Å
 <sup>−2</sup>. The most of the intense peaks were within 1 Å of the Si atoms. Values of thermal parameters of all atoms are within the normal interval (0.007–0.015 A
