<p id="Par19">In the experiments, we first determine the position of the sample plane by measuring the out-of-plane torque as a function of angle Θ from the 
 <italic>z</italic>-axis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The measurements of 
 <italic>τ</italic>(Θ) curves are repeated at various Φ. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows typical curves of 
 <italic>τ</italic>(Θ) for 
 <italic>p</italic> ≈0.11 at 80 K in the superconducting state. At this temperature, 
 <italic>τ</italic>(Θ) exhibits a sharp change when 
 <bold>H</bold> crosses the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane. The data are fitted by a symmetric polynomial function, and accordingly, we precisely determine the alignment of the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane, Θ
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub>, at which 
 <italic>τ</italic>(Θ) = 0. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref> shows Θ
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub>, as a function of angle Φ for 
 <italic>p</italic> ≈ 0.11. Via computer control of the vector field and mechanical rotator systems, we eliminate the misalignment ΔΘ
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub> at each Φ. Then we rotate 
 <bold>H</bold> within the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane with a field misalignment better than 0.1°, without changing setup or removing the sample. Measurements of 
 <italic>τ</italic>(
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) curves are repeated at all the temperatures in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. By analysing all the twofold oscillation curves, we obtain the temperature dependences of 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ab</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>aa</italic>
 </sub> − 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>bb</italic>
 </sub>. After completing all the experiments, the sample alignment is double checked at 80 K to confirm that the sample did not move during the measurement.
