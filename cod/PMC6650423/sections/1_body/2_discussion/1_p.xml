<p id="Par12">It should be stressed that the nature of the nematicity in Hg1201 differs from that in YBCO in several regards. First, in the case of Hg1201, purely spontaneous

 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> rotational symmetry breaking of the electron system occurs in Hg1201 with a tetragonal crystal symmetry. Second, the diagonal nematicity with

 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> symmetry in Hg1201 is in stark contrast to the bond nematicity with

 </sub> symmetry in YBCO. Third, while the growth of the diagonal nematicity is suppressed by the CDW formation in Hg1201, no discernible anomaly is observed at
