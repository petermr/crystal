<p>Very recently, other semiconducting 1D materials, such as Nb
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> and V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub>, were reported to be successfully synthesized by solid-state reactions.

 </sup> These materials can be separated as 1D nanowires up to a single-atomic chain size because of the weak vdW interactions between the selenium ions surrounding the inorganic chains. There are two approaches for preparing the nanowires: (i) mechanical exfoliation, which is similar to the conventional experimental set-ups used in 2D (e.g., graphene, boron nitride, and TMDCs) research,

 </sup> and (ii) chemical exfoliation, which occurs by designing an appropriate solvent and dispersant.

 </sup> Based on these two exfoliation methods, the bulk materials can be separated up to 1 nm in thickness [as experimentally confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM)]; the separated materials can be a single unit of the inorganic chain. In this report, we performed theoretical calculations to investigate the potential optoelectronic applications of V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains after disintegration of bulk V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> crystals into single V
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>9</sub> chains.
