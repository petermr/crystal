 <sub>+1</sub>/PEO composite film (BA = benzyl ammonium, PEO = poly(ethylene oxide)) was used as light‐emitting layer to assemble efficient red light LEDs (Figure

 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref> A lower temperature of 70 °C was enough for the phase transition of CsPbI
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite from yellow phase to black phase, due to the confinement of inorganic layer of BA cation. More importantly, the introduction of PEO not only helps form nanoscale perovskites with smooth thin films due to its viscidity, but also promotes the charge transfer in the perovskite–PEO composite for good PLQYs because of its good ion conductivity.
