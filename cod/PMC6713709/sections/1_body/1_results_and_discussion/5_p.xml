<p id="Par9">Cyclic voltammetry was conducted for Li extraction and insertion of the single crystalline LCO particles. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref> shows the Li extraction up to 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>) and Li insertion down to 2.8 V (vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). A peak around 3.5–4 V was caused by an oxidation reaction of LCO with the extraction reaction of Li. During the photoemission measurements, the potential was intentionally controlled by repeating a potentiostatic mode at 4.5 V (or 2.8 V) for 3 sec and an open circuit voltage (OCV) mode for 57 sec. This repeated cycling of the modes avoided self-discharge and relaxation reactions, which might result in a significant change of the potential under equilibrium conditions after extraction/insertion of Li.
