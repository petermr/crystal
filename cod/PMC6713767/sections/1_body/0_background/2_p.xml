<p id="Par14">Nowadays, Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doped luminescent materials are obtained by reducing Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> to Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, because there is no natural Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doped materials. Usually, it can be realized in a reducing atmosphere including H
 <sub>2</sub>, H
 <sub>2</sub>/N
 <sub>2</sub>, or CO. For example, Gao et al. recently obtained Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated phosphor from Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>-exchanged USY (Na
 <sub>28</sub>Si
 <sub>168</sub>Al
 <sub>28</sub>·240H
 <sub>2</sub>O, Si/Al ratio = 6) zeolites by thermal treatment in H
 <sub>2</sub>/N
 <sub>2</sub> reducing atmosphere [

 <sup>2+</sup>-sensitized Sr
 <sub>6</sub>Ca
 <sub>4</sub> (PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub>F
 <sub>2</sub>:Tb
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphor could be obtained by using high-temperature solid-state method in H
 <sub>2</sub>/N
 <sub>2</sub> reducing atmosphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, the reaction in reductive atmosphere is relatively dangerous and requires well-equipped working environment, which leads to a higher cost of phosphors. In addition, the environmental pollution will be produced if the reaction is proceeded under CO-reducing conditions. Therefore, a green, eco-friendly, and lower cost preparation method has attracted more attention.
