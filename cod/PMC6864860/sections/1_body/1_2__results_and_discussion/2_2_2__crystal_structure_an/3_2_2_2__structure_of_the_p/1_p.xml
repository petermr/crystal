<p>DHB possesses the dual function of hydrogen-bond donors (carboxyl groups) and hydrogen-bond acceptors (hydroxyl groups) in the crystal. This property makes DHB an effective CCF in many co-crystals. Liao and co-workers have performed an exhaustive study of the position isomerism of the hydroxyl groups in a DHB molecule co-crystallization with piracetam [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-03936" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Their investigations showed that the hydrogen bonding pattern of the co-crystals is quite different from that found in our works, despite the DHB isomers possessing the same kind and number of hydroxyl groups. Stilinović and co-workers have investigated the proton transfer phenomenon in a series of salts/co-crystals between DHB and its pyridine derivatives (CCFs) [
