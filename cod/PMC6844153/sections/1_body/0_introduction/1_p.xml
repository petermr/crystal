 </sup> Two-dimensional (2D) materials are composed of planar crystalline sheets stabilized by strong in-plane bonds and weak interlayer interactions. Because graphene was first separated from graphite, graphene-based applications in electronics, chemistry, and mechanics have been intensively studied due to graphene’s superior physical properties (e.g., high charge carrier mobility and mechanical strength). However, graphene does not have a band gap and so is difficult to develop with transistors.

 </sup> If graphene is finely patterned with narrow widths, a band gap can be formed.

 </sup> Unfortunately, as the width of graphene decreases, the band gap increases, and the electron mobility sharply decreases. Other 2D materials with appropriate band gaps, including transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and black phosphorus, have been introduced.

 </sup> Similar to graphene, a dramatic reduction in charge carrier mobility due to edge scattering is inevitable after device manufacture.

 </sup> The reduction of dimensionality also can influence the charge transfer, the structure of the crystal, spin property, or the charge carrier mobility in the metal nanowire system.
