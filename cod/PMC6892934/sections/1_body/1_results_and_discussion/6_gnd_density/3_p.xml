 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the total GND density computed from HR-EBSD, Laue diffraction and CPFE datasets, plotted on the YZ, XZ and the XY cross sections at the indent centre. To enable a direct comparison with both Laue and HR-EBSD measurements, the CPFE predictions are plotted on two different length scales. Complementing each other, the high angular resolution of Laue measurements

 </sup> and high spatial resolution of HR-EBSD measurements

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup> detect the far-field and near-field deformation respectively. In the unimplanted sample, a small zone of high GND density is seen close to the indent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(d)</xref>), with a surrounding larger zone of low GND density (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(c)</xref>). In contrast, the implanted sample shows a relatively larger zone of high GND density surrounding the indent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(h)</xref>), with a surprisingly sharp boundary and very low GND density outside this region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(g)</xref>). The experimental observations show a similar picture, consistent with the predictions from CPFE.
