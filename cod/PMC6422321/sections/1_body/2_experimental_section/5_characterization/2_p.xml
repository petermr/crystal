<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the top view and cross section of the nanophosphor films deposited onto quartz were taken by using a Hitachi S4800 microscope. The crystalline structure of the as-prepared nanophosphors was investigated by XRD (PANalytical X’pert Pro). The excitation and emission spectra as well as the lifetime of these samples were measured with Edinburgh Instruments (FLS1000). The ballistic transmittance of nanophosphor films was recorded using a Cary 7000 series UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. The QY values were measured from the ratio between the light emitted and light absorbed by the nanophosphor films. Thus, they comprise processes from the absorption of the excitation light by the nanophosphor matrix to the transfer to the RE activator and the subsequent outcoupling to free space of the emitted light. The measurements were performed using an integrating sphere attached to FLS 1000.</p>
