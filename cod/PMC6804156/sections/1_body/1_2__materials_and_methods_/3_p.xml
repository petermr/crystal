<p>The powder XRD patterns were collected in the range of 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80° employing Cu Kα radiation from 9 kW rotating anode X-ray tube on a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) working in Bragg-Brentano focusing geometry. The step width was 0.01° and scan speed was 1°/min. Scintillation detector SC-70 (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) together with bent graphite monochromator (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) for diffracted beam was used for the measurements.</p>
