<p>The intraparticle contrast observed in the NCs after reaction with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP was studied with HAADF-STEM and EDS elemental mapping. In micrographs obtained using HAADF-STEM, the intraparticle contrast appears similar to that observed in TEM images (compare 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>a to 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>e). In the elemental maps, the regions of low contrast coincide with regions of low signal for both cations (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>, indicated by orange arrows). As the Cu and Ga distributions correlate well (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b,c), the intraparticle contrast is clearly not due to an inhomogeneous composition. Instead, it appears that the low contrast regions in HAADF-STEM and TEM images simply contain less material. Likely, surface erosion by GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> is not completely suppressed when GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP is used as reactant, resulting in the formation of small cavities at the NC surface.
