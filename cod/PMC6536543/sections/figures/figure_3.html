 <caption> Pressure dependence of the unit-cell volume of Ca 5(Si 2O 7)(CO 3) 2 tilleyite. Solid squares correspond to powder XRD data, and empty blue triangles and green circles correspond to single-crystal XRD data. Fits to all the experimental results for the low- and high-pressure phases are depicted as solid and dashed black lines, respectively. Results from DFT calculations are represented with red lines. </caption>
