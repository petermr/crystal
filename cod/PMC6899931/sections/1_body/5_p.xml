<p>According to the Zintl–Klemm concept and the 8−
 <italic>N</italic> rule, frameworks containing solely four‐bonded tetrel atoms would not require additional electrons for stabilization. Thus, the electron balance of MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> with (4
 <italic>b</italic>)Si atoms may be written as MgSi
 <sub>5</sub>=[Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>][(4
 <italic>b</italic>)Si
 <sup>0</sup>]
 <sub>5</sub>×2 e
 <sup>−</sup> with two excess electrons per formula unit. In a simple picture for a four‐bonded silicon network with electron excess, the electronic density of states (DOS) below the Fermi level would consist of two ranges, which are dominated by s and p states of silicon, respectively, and above a pseudo‐gap‐like minimum, several anti‐bonding states are populated. For example, Ba‐containing clathrates show such a DOS pattern.

 <sub>5</sub> reveals distinct differences (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201907432-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> a). First, the Si‐s‐ and Si‐p‐dominated regions below the Fermi level can still be recognized by the corresponding atomic contributions, but there is no marked separation like the gap found for Ba clathrates.
