<p>Because of this situation, we focused on bismuth sesquioxide (Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) because it has been confirmed as virtually nontoxic in medical references.

 </sup> Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> has several polymorphs, such as α-phase (monoclinic structure), β-phase (tetragonal structure), γ-phase (body-centered cubic structure), and δ-phase (cubic fluorite structure).

 </sup> The band structure of Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> is constituted by a valence band composed of a hybrid Bi 6s and O 2p orbital and a conduction band of Bi 6p.

 </sup> A pale yellowish α phase stably exists at room temperature and is stable up to 730 °C. At 730 °C and above, the α phase is transferred to the orange δ phase. δ-Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> has been suggested as a good electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells and gas sensors, because this compound is stable at high temperatures and exhibits high oxide ion conductivity.
