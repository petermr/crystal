<p>Analysis of changes in structural parameters as a result of synthesis and subsequent annealing was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi TM3030 (Hitachi Ltd., Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan)), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE ECO Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The study of optical characteristics before and after annealing was carried out using the method of ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy (Analytic Jena Specord-250 BU (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were recorded using an Analytic Jena Specord-250 BU spectrophotometer(Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) equipped with integrating sphere. BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> was used as a standard. The resolution was chosen to be 1 nm and the scan speed was 20 nm/s. The spectral range was from 190 nm to 1100 nm.
