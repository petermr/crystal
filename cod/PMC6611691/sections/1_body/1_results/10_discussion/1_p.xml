<p>In previous theoretical treatments of the TLL physics of LMO, only the pure 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xy</sub>
 </italic> orbitals were considered as a key starting ingredient (an assumption justified by the fact that only these cross 
 <italic>E
  <sub>F</sub>
 </italic>) (

  <italic>30</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>34</italic>
 </xref>). Recently however, other orbital degrees of freedom, in particular the interorbital interactions of the 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xz</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>d
  <sub>yz</sub>
 </italic> orbitals, were incorporated into the many-body formalism and shown to affect the low-energy physics (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>) (further details of the model are expounded in section S4). In particular, the specific arrangement of the 
 <italic>d
  <sub>iz</sub>
 </italic>-derived bands provides favorable conditions for the formation of excitons along the P-K line (highlighted in green in the lower panel of 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This exciton resides in adjacent octahedra within the two zigzag chains. The interband exciton has a spin triplet configuration that strongly suppresses the electron-hole recombination probability through photon emission and gives the resulting dark exciton a long lifetime (and allows for spin exchange scattering with the 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xy</sub>
 </italic> fermions). At high temperatures, excitons behave as free particles (with a hopping energy of the order 1 to 2 meV), while at low temperatures, the physics of these emergent particles is governed by a quantum order-by-disorder transition (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>35</italic>
 </xref>), which leads to a Wigner-like periodic arrangement of the excitons. The 
 <italic>d
  <sub>xy</sub>
 </italic> fermions that remained mobile in the presence of the (slightly incommensurate) Umklapp processes associated with quarter-filling now localize on this additional potential, leading to an upturn in the resistivity below
