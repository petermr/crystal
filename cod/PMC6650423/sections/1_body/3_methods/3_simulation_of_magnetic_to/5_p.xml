<p id="Par29">In case (A), when the field is applied within the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane, twofold oscillations are absent even if the sample is mounted on the lever with non-zero mount misalignment. If the magnetic field is applied within a misaligned plane, twofold oscillations due to the out-of-plane anisotropy would appear. However, we note that the phase of the oscillations is unrelated to the crystal axes in this case. One may accidentally observe twofold oscillations. However, we emphasise that we repeated our measurements on several different samples with different mountings. Therefore, such accidental oscillations would not explain the reproducibility of the diagonal nematicity, which is always observed along the [110] direction of the crystals. It should be also noted that the amplitude of the accidental twofold oscillations is much smaller than the observed signal. In the calculation, we use a large field misalignment, much larger than the actual values of our experiments. With the actual setup of
