<p id="Par48">Finally, when 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is very large we recover the usual behavior of active particles in the presence of walls (not shown), i.e. accumulation near walls without any structures in the bulk region. We remark that the suppression of any ordered structure occurs at larger values of 
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> than in the case of the unconfined system. The presence of the walls, which breaks the rotational symmetry, stabilizes the stripe-phase which cannot form in the absence of walls. As in the unconfined case, the drift of the pattern is controlled by the average active force of the whole system. Nevertheless, we observe that the confinement prevents any motion along the transversal direction of the channel.
