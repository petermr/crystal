<p id="Par14">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> we plot the local atom-projected phonon density of states for atom types 2 and 8. We recognize immediately that type 8 has high-energy vibrational states that are completely absent for type 2. None of the other atom types have similar intensity at high energies (not shown). Therefore, atom 8 is mostly responsible for the 18–20 meV region of the phonon density of states for α-plutonium. Interestingly, this high-energy feature is very different from the phonon density of states of δ-plutonium (face-centered cubic) that has no intensity at all above about 15 meV

 </sup>. It is apparent that good phonon properties of α-plutonium can only be modeled by a theory that correctly captures the unusual behavior of the special atom number 8.
