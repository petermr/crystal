<p id="Par11">Starting from the (accurate) QLEED-determined structure (carried at 120 K), we can determine the corresponding electron distribution of the relaxed Cu(410), within the framework of the density functional theory (DFT)

 </sup>. For comparison, we also calculated the corresponding electron distribution for the BULK-truncated structure, and the DFT-optimized (0 K) structure (cf., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Due to the elevation of the terrace atoms, both DFT-optimized and QLEED-determined structures show relative smoothening of the corresponding electron distributions, as compared to the BULK-truncated structure. As in previous theoretical studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, the DFT-optimized structure shows a (−; −; −; −; +) relaxation sequence (cf., Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). (Apparently, increasing the number of atomic layers considered for the LEED analyses did not resolve the difference with previous theoretical studies, contrary to previous expectations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>.) It should be noted that the QLEED-determined structure locates at an energy state ca. 0.03 eV higher than that of the bulk-truncated structure. In comparison, the DFT-optimized structure has a corresponding energy ca. 0.07 eV below that of the bulk-truncated structure. The 120 K difference in working temperature, could sustain the QLEED structure, through the excitation of surface phonons/oscillator states (cf., e.g, refs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup> and references therein) and other anharmonic effects, which are not considered in the ground state total energy calculation.
