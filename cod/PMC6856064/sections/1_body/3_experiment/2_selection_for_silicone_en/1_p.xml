<p id="Par24">In the LED PKG, the role of an encapsulant is to protect the chip and the bonding wire inside the PKG from the physical impact or external environment. Additionally, it serves as a medium to emit light generated from the UV/blue-chip as well as the phosphor. Silicone encapsulant for protecting chips and wire has a double reflector structure for stable filling, and a high heat resistant resin was used for achieving high reliability. In this newly designed PKG structure, we made a silicone resin by mixing pure silicone and phenyl-based silicone, and the content and mixing ratio of green and red phosphors were optimized to produce PKG having all the CRI points equal to or above 95. The essential characteristics that the encapsulant used for the LED PKG should have are physically resistant to the high heat generated at the UV/blue LED junction, and the interfacial adhesion must be ensured to protect LED from the external high temperature and high humidity environment. To ensure the reliability of the PKG and to maximize the efficiency of light extraction, phenyl-based silicone was used as an encapsulant. The encapsulants used for fabricating LEDs and their properties are summarized in TableÂ
