<p id="Par11">The nanowire growth terminates when there is an abrupt breakup of the neck, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>. The lateral drift of the drawing tip gradually bent the nanowire, exerting an additional shear load to the thin neck and resulting in the ultimate breakup. A comparison of the nanowire profile is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, revealing the elastic relaxation of the nanowire back to a straight shape. The breakup of the neck and the elastic spring-back of the nanowire can be used to estimate the shear strength of the neck. The shear strength is estimated to be ~300 MPa, indicating that the neck is still strong solid (see Supplementary Note
