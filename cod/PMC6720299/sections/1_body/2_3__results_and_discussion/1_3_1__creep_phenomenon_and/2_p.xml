<p>In the creep curves of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the slope of the curves represented the strain rate during creep. The strain rate decreased with time, representing the primary creep phase, characterized by the slope of the curve tending to be flat. The strain rate remained constant with time, representing the steady-state creep phase, characterized by the slope of the curve being constant. The strain rate increased with time, representing the tertiary creep phase, characterized by a steep increase in the slope of the curve.
