<p>The reported formation enthalpy of alane is around −6 to −9 kJ/mol H
 <sub>2</sub>; thus, an equilibrium pressure of the order of 10
 <sup>5</sup> bar at room temperature is expected [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the minimum hydrogen pressure, experimentally observed and calculated, which is necessary for the formation of the alane from the elements is about 7000 bar at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B55-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, on-board regeneration of alane for hydrogen storage in automotive applications is definitely out of the picture. Recently, a report on nanoconfined AlH
 <sub>3</sub> indicates partial re-hydrogenation at 150 °C and 60 bar [
 <xref rid="B56-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Nanoconfinement reduces the hydrogen content; however, it must be explored as a way to reach reversibility.
