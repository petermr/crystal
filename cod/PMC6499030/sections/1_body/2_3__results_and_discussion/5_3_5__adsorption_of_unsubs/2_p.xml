<p>The central hydrogens of the molecule form a hydrogen bond of 1.8 Å with the neighboring nitrogens, while one of them (H1) tries to attach to the O

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The calculated adsorption energy is of –3.18 eV with the molecule centered on the oxygen row and of −3.54 eV with the molecule centered on the titanium row. Therefore, the adsorption of H
 <sub>2</sub>Pc is more favorable if the molecule is centered on Ti
