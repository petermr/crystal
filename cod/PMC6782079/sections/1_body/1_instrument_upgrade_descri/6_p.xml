<p>The detector coverage was increased from 30 modules to 40 modules. The in-plane positions on both sides were filled (24 detectors) and the remaining 16 detectors were placed out of plane on the previously empty side of the instrument, as seen in Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>. This choice was made as the divergence from the incident optics allows the highest resolution in the in-plane locations. The far out-of-plane locations in backscattering and forward scattering positions require higher spatial resolution in the vertical direction to follow the higher curvature of the Debye–Sherrer diffraction lines, thereby minimizing associated diffraction peak broadening. The detector array consists of wavelength shifting fiber (WLSF) scintillator detector modules, each with an active area of 38.5 × 77 cm and coarse pixel size of 5 × 55 mm (horizontal × vertical). At POWGEN, there are 20 version 2 and 20 version 3 detector modules, which differ in the mapping of vertical position-encoding fibers. Both are based around the same 32 single-anode photomultiplier tube channels for time-active discrimination and FPGA electronics board for signal processing. Version 3 fiber mapping is optimized for subpixel interpolation of the neutron event position in both the horizontal and vertical directions, whereas version 2 mapping is optimized for fine horizontal positioning only. Both versions are expected to ultimately have horizontal spatial resolutions of ∼3 mm and vertical spatial resolutions of 55 and ∼20 mm, respectively. Both version 2 and version 3 detectors are used in the current instrument.
