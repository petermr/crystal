<p>Due to the high sensitivity of 
 <bold>2</bold>, a partial decomposition takes place when it is dissolved in deuterated solvents and, in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, among the signals corresponding to 
 <bold>2</bold>, further signals for unidentified decomposition products are present. The partial decomposition of 
 <bold>2</bold> when being dissolved in organic solvents cannot be suppressed even when being dissolved at low temperatures. 
 <sup>2</sup>H NMR spectroscopic investigations of 
 <bold>2D</bold> show a main resonance signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>=1.33 ppm, which is attributed to the As
 <sub>2</sub>D
 <sub>2</sub> unit. For 
 <bold>A</bold>, no resonance signal for the hydrogen atoms attached to the arsenic atoms could be detected, due to the paramagnetic nature of the complex.
