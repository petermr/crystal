<p>The choice of materials determines the range of white shades in which the chromaticity can be tuned. In our demonstration, we choose two nanophosphors that yield warm white light (2600 K) when combined in a stack that is photoexcited with light of 300 nm. High efficiency as well as a dynamic chromatic tuning of PL has been shown. The combination of these features with the level of transparency achieved allows us to foresee a great potential impact of the approach proposed herein in the field of solid-state lighting and displays. These novel color-converting coatings are also easily processed and are versatile in terms of the substrate they can be deposited on. Future developments must target the development of layered phosphor coatings that can be efficiently photoexcited at longer wavelengths, for which more efficient electroluminescence sources exist, so that a high electrical-to-luminous power conversion ratio can be achieved.</p>
