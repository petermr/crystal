<p id="Par9">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the streaks for the (2 0 0) peak along L direction for ‘crystal a’ is much more pronounced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) than that of ‘crystal b’ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), which could be induced by strain, stacking fault or disorder in the bulk single crystal sample. Since the refined average 
 <italic>c</italic> lattice parameter remains essentially unchanged for both crystals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the much more pronounced streaks for ‘crystal a’ are likely from microstrain caused by randomly distributed defects in ‘crystal a’, which is evident from scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) measurement (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> below). The split of the peaks along 
 <italic>c</italic> also indicates twinning and multidomain structures of ‘crystal a’. In particular, we note from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (bottom panels) that the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for the (2 0 0) peak along L direction is some 0.13–0.27 reciprocal lattice units larger than that of ‘crystal b.’ If one assumes that in the ordered ‘crystal b’ the finite (i.e. non-zero) FWHM is largely due to measurement resolution limits, the FWHM for ‘crystal a’ would correspond to a ~2–5% local variation in the lattice constant 
 <italic>c</italic>.
