 <sub class="sub">10</sub>. The room temperature XRD measurements on all samples were consistent with mixed phases of orthorhombic and monoclinic symmetry. However, the in-plane lattice constants of these two phases differ by &lt;1%, leading to minimal influence on band structure calculations. Furthermore, any impact on the experimental Fermi surface attributable to such deviations would be obscured by broadening of the bands measured by ARPES. Therefore, the DFT calculations adopt the higher symmetry orthorhombic crystal structure with space group
