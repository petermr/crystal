<p>(2) With the increase of crystallinity, the corresponding breakdown field strength of four kinds of polyethylene with different densities also increases greatly. Simultaneously, we find that the larger the shape parameter, the smaller the dispersion of the breakdown strength data. In this respect, polyethylene exhibits more stable dielectric properties.</p>
