 <caption> ( a) 3D rendering of the CPFE simulated volume coloured according to the predicted displacement magnitude along the Z axis of the indented tungsten block. X, Y and Z axes are superimposed. Slices 1–3, drawn on the block, represent the three sections along the X-axis (indent centre - slice 2), on which the lattice rotations predicted by CPFE are plotted. ( b) Visualization of the sample volume measured by Laue diffraction, coloured according to the experimentally measured intensity. Superimposed are the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as the slices on which the measured lattice rotations are plotted. Comparison of lattice rotations predicted by CPFE and measured by Laue (Laue measurements in 14 ) for the ( c) unimplanted sample and ( d) the helium-implanted sample. Comparison of lattice rotation as predicted by CPFE and measured by HR-EBSD for the ( e) unimplanted sample and ( f) the helium-implanted sample. With respect to the initial crystallographic coordinates, the X axis is [1 −1 0], Y is [1 1 0] and Z is [001]. Data from CPFE simulations, Laue diffraction and HR-EBSD experiments are displayed on the same length- and colour-scale. The dotted white lines in ( a) and ( c) represent the depth at which the line plots in Fig.  4 were extracted. Lattice rotations are plotted in radians. </caption>
