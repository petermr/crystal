<p>TaH
 <sub>2</sub>(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> was reported by Kost et al. in 1978 [
 <xref rid="B239-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. The compound has a hydrogen content of 4.11 wt.%. It was produced in cold ether by the reaction between LiH, Al and a metal halide. Kost et al. reported that TaH
 <sub>2</sub>(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is a red powder that decomposes at 130 Â°C. TaH
 <sub>2</sub>(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> and AlH
 <sub>3</sub> are the decomposition products of a very unstable Ta(AlH
