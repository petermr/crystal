<p>The 
 <italic>Immb</italic> modifications 
 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oI</italic>88) and 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oI</italic>88) differ from the structures discussed before in their stacking sequence of the ferrate layers along [010]. The trenches of neighboring layers are opposing each other according to a mirror plane between them. Again, the hydrogen bonds connect within and between ferrate layers. However, they are not forming chains but square homodromes with O−H⋅⋅⋅O distances of 273 pm in 
 <italic>
  <bold>Rb</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oI</italic>88) and 283 pm in 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oI</italic>88) (Figure 
 <xref rid="open201900287-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, right). Both chiralities of the homodrome are equally probable, in accordance with local 
 <italic>mm</italic>2 symmetry. The hydrogen connectivity is parallel to the (001) plane. Accordingly, the 
 <italic>a</italic>‐axes of the 
 <italic>Immb</italic> modifications are much shorter than those of the 
 <italic>Cmce</italic> modifications (−8.6 %, −11.1 %), while the 
 <italic>c</italic>‐axes are much longer (7.7 %, 9.0 %). The densities of the two modifications are almost equal for each of the compounds, thus it can be argued that they have rather similar lattice energies. This complies with the finding of mixtures of both modifications in all hydroflux syntheses. Moreover, the structure determination of two 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oI</italic>88) single‐crystals showed some significant residual electron density, which can be explained by stacking faults according to the 
 <italic>
  <bold>Cs</bold>
 </italic>(
 <italic>oC</italic>88′) structure.
