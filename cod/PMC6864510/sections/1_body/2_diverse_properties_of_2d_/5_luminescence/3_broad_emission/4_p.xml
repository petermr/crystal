<p>The fluorescence spectrum hardly changes by changing the morphology and crystallinity, so the surface defects are not the cause of these wide emissions. According to the emission dependence on excitation intensity diagram, the PL intensity increases linearly with the increase of excitation intensity, and there is no PL saturation. Both indicate that the broadband emission is not from the permanent defects of the materials.[qv: 111a] Then, this wide fluorescence emission of (110) 2D perovskites is confirmed to be from the “excited‐state defects” formed from transient lattice distortions, which are induced by the coupling of photogenerated electrons/holes with the lattice. The intrinsic self‐trapping states of 2D perovskites can be explained by a model depicted in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d(A). The electron or hole is regarded as a hard ball. When the ball falls on the elastic sheet (soft lattice), the sheet is twisted, and then the sheet will return to its original state in the absence of the ball. This is different from the permanent defect trapping in that the distortion is already present before the ball drops onto the sheet, and the ball will sink with different indentation depths, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1307-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d(B). However, the extrinsic self‐trapping is related to lattice with local heterogeneity (Figure
