<p>There is a huge amount of XPD data in the literature. Previously, XPD results have been obtained using two different techniques. (i) Conventional XPS analyzers in combination with two-axes sample rotation allow scanning large polar angular ranges (typically 0–60°) and full azimuthal scans. This method was pioneered by Fadley and co-workers (Fadley, 1987
