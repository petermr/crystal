<p id="Par5">There are two major reasons why we chose LCPs as the target of our ML-LSA. One is that liquid crystal networks (LCNs) that consists of LCPs have been attracting growing interest as a promising material for practical applications such as sensing and actuator devices; LCNs exhibit macroscopic deformations to modest external stimuli such as electrical and magnetic fields and irradiated light

 </sup>, which is attributable to the combination of the orientational degrees of freedom and the entropic elasticity of the polymer network and the resulting soft elasticity. Indeed this unique responsiveness motivated the development of several types of LCN actuators
