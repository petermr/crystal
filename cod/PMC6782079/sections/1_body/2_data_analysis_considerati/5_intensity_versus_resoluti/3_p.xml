<p>It is immediately clear that there are very large gains in low-
 <italic>Q</italic> data due to the wavelength dependence of the diffracted intensity. If both high and low 
 <italic>Q</italic> are needed and a time-dependent process is not being studied, users can easily use two different settings with different counting times (longer wavelength settings take less time to achieve the same level of statistics). Also, if we consider the resolution function stated in equation (4)
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd4"/>, by changing the wavelength one can relocate a certain Bragg peak to a different 2Î¸, which allows movement to a higher or lower resolution depending on the need of the science case. This mode of operation gives enormous flexibility in choosing the resolution and intensity.
