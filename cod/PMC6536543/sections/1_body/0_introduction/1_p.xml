 </sup>. Melting phase relations of recycled oceanic crust recently reported suggest that slabs should undergo melting and loss of carbonate components at 300–700 km depths

 </sup>. However, the form carbon takes depends on the redox conditions in inner Earth, which is defined in terms of oxygen fugacity of the environment. The carbon oxidation state is still poorly constrained and is debated at present, but recent studies considered that carbonates may get reduced to diamond below ~250 km depth
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup> due to a low oxygen fugacity

 </sup>. Therefore, the structure and properties of compositionally relevant oxidized carbon-bearing phases at shallower depths (upper mantle) are of great interest for the geophysical community. In this sense, silicate-carbonates are potential host structures for carbon in Earth’s interior, particularly in the proximity of carbonate-rich subduction slabs.
