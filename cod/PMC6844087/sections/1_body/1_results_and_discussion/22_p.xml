 </xref>A,B, two CuFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> peaks are represented. It can be seen that, despite the case of sample #1, all of the samples are close to the maximum value. In addition, sample #2 is slightly less intense, and those samples prepared at 950 Â°C reach the same values independently of the calcination time.

 </xref>C,D represents impurity peaks. The first, corresponding to a characteristic Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> peak, is actually inexistent for the four samples, giving thus a good idea about the purity improvement in this batch. Finally, the last image indicates that all samples still have some CuO traces, which are almost the same in all of them. To have more detailed information, all samples have been refined by the Rietveld method.
