<p>In this work, four kinds of montmorillonite formed in different geological processes in China were used as experimental materials, and according to the chemical analysis results of purified montmorillonites, the position of all kinds of ions in montmorillonite crystals was determined, and the crystal-chemical formula was calculated. On this basis, the crystal structure models of four kinds of montmorillonite were established. The effect of layer charge density on its hydration characteristics was studied both by the methods of MD simulation and experiment.</p>
