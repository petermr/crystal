 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f006">Figure 6</xref> provides the RDFs of O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub> in montmorillonite with different charge positions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, M4) and densities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f006">Figure 6</xref>b, Mi
 <sub>0-6</sub>). The g (O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) presents the RDF of O
 <sub>t</sub> and H
 <sub>w</sub>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows that first peak of g(O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) of montmorillonite appears at the distance of approximately 2.5 Å. With the increase of the ratio of isomorphism in the tetrahedron, the intensity of the main peak of g(O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) was enhanced, which indicates that when the montmorillonite layer charge was mostly derived from the substitution among ions in the tetrahedron, the Si–O surface exhibited a stronger polar force, and the water molecule had a polar side (i.e., the side where H was located), which was subjected to a stronger polar force from the Si–O surface, making the water molecules more compact near the siloxane surface, so the intensity of the main peak of g(O
 <sub>t</sub>-H
 <sub>w</sub>) in the RDF was enhanced.
