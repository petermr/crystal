<p id="Par20">Although SALON powder in this early state without any protective coating is not stable against direct exposure to water, it was possible to construct a prototype pc-LED, where SALON was shown to be stable enough to be utilized in silicone under ambient conditions up to at least 250 °C. As demonstrated for SLA, even highly sensitive nitride materials can be stabilized enough to be used in commercial pc-LEDs
