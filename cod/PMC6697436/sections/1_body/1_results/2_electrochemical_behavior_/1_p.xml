<p>To confirm the role of 
 <italic>d</italic>-derived surface states from Co atoms, high-quality bulk single crystals with the desired surface terminations are required. Here, we developed a self-flux method for the synthesis of large-size Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>18</italic>
 </xref>). OER activities were measured in a conventional three-electrode cell containing 1 M KOH solution at a low scan rate of 5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> to minimize capacitive currents. A cuboid-shaped bulk single crystal was attached to a Cu wire by silver paint and used as the working electrode. 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the 
 <italic>i</italic>R-corrected linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curve of the bulk single crystal. When the thermodynamic OER potential (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sup>0</sup> H
 <sub>2</sub>O/O
 <sub>2</sub> = 1.23 V) is used as the reference, an overpotential of just 300 mV is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. This value is close to, or even smaller than that for, nanostructured electrocatalysts with a considerably larger surface area (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), such as (Ni/Co)
 <sub>0.85</sub>Se nanotube arrays (255 mV) (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>), CoN nanowires (290 mV) (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>25</italic>
 </xref>),CoSn
 <sub>2</sub> nanocrystals (299 mV) (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>), and NiCo metal-organic framework nanosheets (371 mV) (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>27</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>29</italic>
 </xref>). Crushing the bulk single crystal into small particles and deposited these onto Ni foam results in a further enhanced OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The poor activity of Ni foam and Cu wire with silver paint suggests that the high catalytic activity of this sample originates from the Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub> phase (fig. S5).
