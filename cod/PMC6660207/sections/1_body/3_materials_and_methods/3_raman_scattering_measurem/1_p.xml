<p>Raman scattering measurement was performed in backscattering geometry using a micro-Raman spectrometer (Horiba T64000). The excitation laser was introduced using a 50× long focus lens, and Raman signals were collected through the same lens. A forestage triple grating system with following grating (1800 g/mm) was used to disperse the Raman signal to achieve as low frequency as 6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. To avoid in resonance with the PL of 2D perovskite, 532- and 633-nm lasers were alternatively used. When the emission was in the green to yellow range, 633 nm was used for excitation. When entering the red emission range, 532 nm was used.
