 </inline-formula> reveals the different response of the molecules within dimers and from two consecutive dimers in a stack. The relative lateral shift between two molecules is defined here as half of the distance between the center of one pyrene moiety and an orthogonal projection of the center of the next one. Within a “dimer”, this shift remains constant, indicating that such a dimer is a conserved synthon in this crystal structure. In the case of molecules from two consecutive dimers, a small decrease in the lateral shift of each pyrene molecules can be observed (
