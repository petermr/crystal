<p>Another small‐pore zeolite with a slightly different heart‐shaped cavity was reported recently by Bereciartua and co‐workers.
 <xref rid="anie201905049-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> The framework structure of this zeolite, ITQ‐55, consists of heart‐shaped cavities exclusively. These 48 T‐atom cavities ([8
 <sup>3</sup>6
 <sup>8</sup>5
 <sup>8</sup>4
 <sup>9</sup>]) are interconnected via three shared 8‐ring windows forming a 2‐dimensional channel system. The difference between the ITQ‐55 and SSZ‐27 heart‐shaped cavities is that two 4‐rings and one 8‐ring in the ITQ‐55 cavity are replaced by two 6‐rings and two 5‐rings in SSZ‐27 (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201905049-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> b, c). Furthermore, the 8‐ring openings in ITQ‐55 appear to be more restricted (free dimensions: 2.1×5.8 Å and 3.4×5.3 Å) than those in SSZ‐27 (3.6×5.5 Å; Supporting Information Figure S5).
