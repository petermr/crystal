<p>The high-temperature cubic phase of SrCoO
 <sub>3−δ</sub> is a promising material due to its high electrical conductivity and oxygen permeation flux [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-01957" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-01957" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Depending on the synthesis conditions and the oxygen content, we can obtain different structural distortions such as orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic unit cells. Whereas the cubic phase exhibits an excellent ionic and electronic conductivity, the hexagonal phase has very poor properties and, unfortunately, it is thermodynamically stable, which limits the use of this pure material as a cathode in SOFC. As a strategy to prevent this cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition, it was found that replacing few percentages of Co by aliovalent elements like Re, Nb, Sb or Ti was effective to stabilize the cubic phase in a wide temperature range [

 <sub>0.05</sub>O
 <sub>3−δ</sub> with an additional Ba doping at the Sr positions, in order to expand the unit-cell volume, so as to enhance the ion diffusion of O
 <sup>2−</sup> ions through the crystal lattice in this MIEC oxide. Our goal was to improve the electrochemical, electrical and catalytic performance of this compound in order to use it as a cathode in a SOFC.
