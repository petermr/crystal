<p id="Par7">In this work it was anticipated that the lattice mismatch between the equilibrium crystal phases in the (Au,Ag)-Si system may also be large enough to enable formation of MGMCs. Unlike (Zr,Ti)-Be and La-(Cu,Ni), however, where such mismatch arises from a large atomic size difference, the mismatch in the (Au,Ag)-Si system is thought to arise from vastly different crystal structures of (Au,Ag) and pure Si. The primary (Au,Ag) phase is face-centered cubic with 12 nearest neighbors, while pure Si is a tetrahedrally-bonded diamond cubic structure having just 4 nearest neighbors. A preexisting face-centered-cubic (Au,Ag) dendrite would likely be an unfavorable template for the heterogeneous nucleation of diamond cubic Si. Such lattice mismatch would hence encourage vitrification of the liquid matrix leading to MGMC formation. It was also thought that certain elemental additions known to promote glass formation in the (Au,Ag)-Si system, such as Cu and Pd (ref.
