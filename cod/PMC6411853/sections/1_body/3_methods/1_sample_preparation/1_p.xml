<p id="Par25">The Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>3</sub> single crystal was cleaned by mild Ar
 <sup>+</sup> ion sputtering followed by annealing up to about 500 °C leading to a clean surface and to a sharp contrasted (1 × 1) low energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern

 </sup>. Presynthesized BiTeI was loaded into a Knudsen cell and heated up to 380 °C. Single crystals of BiTeI were obtained by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) technique starting from a stoichiometric mixture of Bi, BiI
 <sub>3</sub> and Te. A sealed quartz ampoule with the reactants was placed into a two-zone furnace with a temperature gradient for 5 days. The reactants were held at 500 °C and the hexagonal platelets of BiTeI up to 5 mm in diameter have grown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), by autotransport, directly on the batch. We used the optimum temperature gradient 500/450 °C reported for the gas-phase transport of BiTeI on the basis of comprehensive phase-diagram studies

 </sup>. The chemical purity of the product was confirmed by X-ray energy dispersive analysis and powder X-ray diffraction that yielded, respectively, a slightly Te-deficient composition and a strong preferred orientation of the powdered sample in consistence with its high crystallinity.
