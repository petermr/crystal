<p>In addition, according to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f003">Figure 3</xref>, we can also find that the layer charge density of montmorillonite has a significant effect on the distribution of water molecules in interlayer. When the charge density is low (such as M1), the water molecules are mainly distributed near the central axis, which is shown as two sharp peaks in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f003">Figure 3</xref>. With the increase of charge density (such as M2 and M3), the main peaks on both sides of the central axis begin to split, and at the same time, the peaks get weaker. When the charge density increases to 0.688 (such as M4), two new peaks begin to form near about –2.5 Å and 2.4 Å, and so does the H
 <sub>w</sub>. The reason is that with the increase of the charge density, more and more hydrogen atoms in the water molecules turn to the Si-O surface, the number of hydrogen bonds formed by H
 <sub>w</sub> and O
 <sub>t</sub> (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03997-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and Figure 10) increases, and as a result, more and more water molecules are closely bound to the Si-O surface. However, as the montmorillonite charge density increases, a new small peak of water molecules appears near the axis; the reason is that the water molecules distributed in the middle of the interlayer domain are subjected to an equal hydrogen bonding force from both of the two Si-O surfaces; this phenomenon is more obvious when the layer charge density of montmorillonite is higher.
