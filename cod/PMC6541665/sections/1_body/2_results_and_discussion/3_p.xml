 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the optoelectronic properties of the mini-CSPLED blue BLUs with different emission angles. With the same forward voltage of 24 V (at 10 mA), the CIE chromaticity coordinates (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) of the 120° mini-CSPLED BLU, the 150° mini-CSPLED BLU, and the 180° mini-CSPLED BLU were all similar and (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>) = (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.1518 − 0.15.2, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.026 − 0.0281). Furthermore, the light output powers of the 120° mini-CSPLED blue BLU, 150° mini-CSPLED blue BLU, and 180° mini-CSPLED blue BLU were measured at 147.43, 153.02, and 146.71 mW, respectively. Due to the 180° mini-CSPLED package structure factor, the light output power was slightly poor, but the illumination area was increased.
