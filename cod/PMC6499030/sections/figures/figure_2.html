 <caption> (Color online) Anatase (101) structure relaxed with AEâ€“LCAO (HSE). (A) Stoichiometric surface, oxygen and titanium atoms are plotted in red and blue, respectively. The coordination of atoms in the top layer is represented in cyan (Ti 5 c ), green (Ti 6 c ), magenta (O 2 c ), and yellow (O 3 c ). (B) H adsorption, where H atom is represented in gray, the O 2 c bonded to H in green and the spin polarized Ti 5 c in cyan, (C) O monovacancy, where the spin polarized Ti 5 c atoms are represented in cyan (minimum energy configuration) and yellow (alternative configuration of the spin). </caption>
