 <caption>
  <p>The distribution of reciprocal-lattice points (red) for samples with fibre-textured crystallites, (
   <italic>a</italic>) with the 
   <italic>z</italic> axis as the rotation axis, (
   <italic>b</italic>) for samples with fibre texture combined with a partial in-plane texture, and (
   <italic>c</italic>) for azimuthally oriented crystallites. Blue arrows are selected reciprocal-lattice vectors. (
   <italic>d</italic>) Two cuts through reciprocal space by two GIXD measurements taken at different sample azimuths.
