<p>Amit et al. reported the use of mechanical rubbing for the macroscopic scale alignment semiconductor QRs.
 <xref rid="advs1374-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> The CdSe/CdS QRs, exhibiting linearly polarized emission, were aligned by mechanical rubbing of a spin‐coated glass substrate, as shown in

 </xref>. The dragging force exerted by the rubbing fibers resulted in deflection and reorientation of the QRs along the rubbing direction. The rubbing process was optimized by tuning surface–particle and particle–particle interactions yielding high polarization ratios of 3.5:1 relative to the previously reported values of 1.75:1 and 2.2:1 attained by the rubbing of the QR layers. The surface–particle interaction is an important factor for the rubbing process, one that may have serious limitations on the thickness of the film. The film thickness (at least several microns, depending on the QR concentration and absorption coefficients) should be enough to maintain color saturation and brightness for LCD applications.
