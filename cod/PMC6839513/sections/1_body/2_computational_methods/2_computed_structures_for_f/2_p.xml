<p>As a necessary mathematical condition for 
 <italic>local</italic> stability of the lattice with respect to displacements of the atoms, the potential energy surface must in fact be convex around the stationary point reached by the optimization. Equivalently, the matrix formed by the second derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the atomic displacements must be 
 <italic>positive definite</italic>; i.e., all the matrix eigenvalues must be positive.

 </sup> A negative eigenvalue means that the system is at a saddle point and that the lattice is unstable with respect to displacements along the corresponding eigenvector.
