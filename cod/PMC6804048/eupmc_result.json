    "The adhesion of the scale formed on Nb-silicide based alloys at 1473 K improves when Al and Sn are in synergy with Si and Ti. This improvement is observed when there is segregation of Sn in the microstructure below the alloy/scale interface and a layer rich in intermetallics that include TM5Sn2X compounds is formed at the interface. Data for the ternary compounds is scarce. In this paper elastic and thermodynamic properties of the Nb5Sn2Al, Ti5Sn2Si, Ti5Sn2Al and Nb5Sn2Si compounds were studied using the first-principles, pseudopotential plane-wave method based on density functional theory. The enthalpy of formation of the ternary intermetallics was calculated using the quasi-harmonic approximation. The calculations suggest that the Nb5Sn2Si is the stiffest; that the Nb5Sn2Al and Ti5Sn2Si are the most and less ductile phases respectively; and that Nb significantly increases the bulk, shear and elastic moduli of the ternary compound compared with Ti."
