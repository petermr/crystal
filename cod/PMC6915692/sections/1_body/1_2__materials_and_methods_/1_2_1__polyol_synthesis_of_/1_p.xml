<p>Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Tungsten (VI) chloride was used as tungsten source and diethylene glycol (DEG) as solvent. WCl
 <sub>6</sub> (7,2 g) was added to 100 mL of DEG and 20 mL of distilled water. The mixture was heated at 180 °C with continuous stirring and refluxed for 3 h. At the end of the reaction, a deep blue precipitate was obtained. The precipitate was washed and centrifuged several times with ethanol to remove any trace of solvent and dried in an oven at 80 °C. In order to study the influence of the heat treatment parameters, the as-synthesized powders were annealed at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 600 °C under air atmosphere or annealed at 600 °C under oxygen partial pressure from 10
 <sup>−2</sup> bar to 10
 <sup>−5</sup> bar (thanks to a calibrated mixtures of argon flow with 10
 <sup>−5</sup> bar and oxygen partial pressure and gas flow). The three extreme samples: i.e., the raw powder, and the two compounds obtained after post-annealing treatments at 600 °C under air and argon atmospheres were chosen as main references for discussion.
