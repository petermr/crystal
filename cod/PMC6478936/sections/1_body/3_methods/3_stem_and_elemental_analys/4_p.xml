<p id="Par34">Concerning the lithium quantification, it is important to note that ion intensity data cannot easily be converted into elemental concentrations, as the ionization probability is not solely sensitive to the elements in question, yet also depending on the composition of the sample. This is the so-called matrix effect
 <sup>

 </sup>, which describes that the composition of the sample matrix itself affects the ionization probability of the elements. Nonetheless, the secondary ion intensity of a chosen element (in this case, lithium) can be used to describe the concentration within the sample, if the matrix effect is accounted for. As SALON is the only known oxonitridolithoÂ aluminate, there is no standard, which is similar enough to fully compensate these matrix effects. Hence, Sr[LiAl
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>] was used as the standard for the measurements in this manuscript, as it is similar to SALON in that it is at least a nitridolithoaluminate. However, using Sr[LiAl
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>] as a standard some matrix effects are still to be expected, which increases the error margins of the quantification.
