 <caption> Efficient SH vortex beam shaping. a Dependence of output powers of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd diffraction orders on pump wavelength. The pump power is kept at 0.8 W. The peak values indicate the effect of QPM. b Dependence of output powers of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd diffraction orders on pump power at the QPM wavelengths of 820 nm, 802 nm, and 781 nm, respectively </caption>
