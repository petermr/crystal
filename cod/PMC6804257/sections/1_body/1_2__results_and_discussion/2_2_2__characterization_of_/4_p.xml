<p>The XPS spectrum of MnL14 showed 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> core electron peaks at 640.9 and 652.6 eV, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f003">Figure 3</xref>). These values agreed with those reported previously for bivalent Mn [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the case of FeL14, the peaks corresponding to 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> were found at 710.0 and 722.9 eV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f003">Figure 3</xref>), which are attributed to trivalent iron [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For the copper spectrum of CuL14, the well-defined peaks at 932.5 and 952.3 eV are attributed to the 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> core electron levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Every peak was accompanied by a broad peak at the higher energy side. The latter is attributable to the shake-up satellite that appears characteristically in transition metals with an open 3d-eleclecton shell [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-03556" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In some cases, the satellites were almost as intense as the main peaks, as observed for the 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> peaks of the Mn and Fe (d
 <sup>5</sup>) complexes. These shake-up satellites that appeared in the core electron spectra of the transitional metal complexes resulted from a charge–transfer-type transition. Charge-transfer shake-up satellites are reasonably expected for the core-electron spectra of transition metals in complexes having a π bond character, which induces a ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The positions and intensities of these type of satellites are defined by the nature of the metal, ligands, and the symmetry of the complex [
