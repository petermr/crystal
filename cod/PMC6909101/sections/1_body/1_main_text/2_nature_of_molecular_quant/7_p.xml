<p id="p0115">In addition to the previously mentioned qualitative objections, there is no formal quantitative substantiation for the Franck-Condon principle in theory. Proceeding from the first principles of quantum mechanics, it is necessary to quantitatively solve the problem of the dynamics of the transient state in molecular quantum transitions, at least in some simple cases. Moreover, such a solution, particularly substantiating the Franck-Condon principle, should clearly be demonstrated in many diverse applications. However, such a solution has not been obtained to date.</p>
