<p>In 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, AE–LCAO (B3LYP and HSE) calculations show an increase of the surface band gap of around 2% when an oxygen monovacancy is present. This result can be due again to the approximation of considering few layers to simulate the real surface or to the interaction of polaronic distortions as explained above. AE–LCAO (HSE) also describes very similar peaks for the gap state corresponding to the Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> ion on the outermost layer in both defects, as it can be seen in
