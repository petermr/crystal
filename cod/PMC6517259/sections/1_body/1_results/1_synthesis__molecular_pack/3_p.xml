<p id="p0050">The electronic band structure of the O5H-OMeDPA crystal was calculated by DFT to gain insights on hole conductivity. From the results shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>, one can notice that the band dispersion is quite small, as is typical of organic HTMs. Differences between adjacent energy levels show variations within 0.02 eV, depending on the directions of reciprocal space (i.e., 
 <italic>Γ</italic>Z, 
 <italic>Γ</italic>B, and 
 <italic>Γ</italic>Y). We also computed hole effective masses and electron transfer integrals (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). Along the ΓY direction of the Brillouin zone (the crystallographic 
 <italic>a</italic> axis), we recorded an effective hole mass of 8.35 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>. The values are smaller along the 
 <italic>Γ</italic>Z and 
 <italic>Γ</italic>B directions of the Brillouin zone, being 5.17 and 6.67 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>, respectively, suggesting the higher hole mobilities along the 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> axes of the lattice space (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D).
