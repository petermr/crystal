<p>On the other hand, a full parameterization of the Al/Si ordering of a certain supercell is rather cumbersome to set up, analyse and describe. This becomes even more complicated if different supercells with a different number of atoms are compared. Hence, the comparison of total energy calculations of supercells described in physical space is a useful method to systematically determine the ideal Al/Si ordering pattern, but a comparison and assessment of the resulting supercells are inconclusive. An elegant and efficient solution to this problem is to compare the structures in (3+1)-dimensional superspace, which requires the establishment of superspace models from the geometrically optimized structures.</p>
