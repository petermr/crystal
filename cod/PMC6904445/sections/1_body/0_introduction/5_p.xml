 </sup>. The temperature dependence of the magnetization measured in ZFC conditions shows clear anomalies at 56 and 40 K, respectively, while the FC curve exhibits a broad peak at about 30 K. The anomaly at 56 K was assigned to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> spins in the in-plane triangular lattice, and the anomaly at 40 K was ascribed to the Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> spin-reorientation transition
