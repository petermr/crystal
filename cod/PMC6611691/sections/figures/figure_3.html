 <caption> Origin of the asymmetry and determination of the critical angle. ( A) Field sweeps of the MR at 1.2 K are measured at various angles within the ac plane, showing the evolution of the peak field with angle. The angle of the dashed thick curve is ~6° from the c axis. The maximal MR at B = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 T are denoted by empty symbols and correspond to the peaks in ( B). Inset: Expanded plot of the region of the MR curves contained below the dashed line in the main panel. (B) Same data as in (A), replotted for fixed field strengths. Each is vertically shifted for better visibility. Comparison with Fig. 2F shows almost identical behavior. ( C) Same data as in (A) with the field values scaled by |cosθ|. The actual scaling factor, i.e., the ratio between B scaled and B, is depicted in fig. S7. Inset: Expanded plot of the dashed rectangle in the main panel. ( D) The resultant peak field values obtained from Fig. 3C plotted as a function of angle within the ac plane. At the critical angle θ CR, the negative MR is maximally suppressed. </caption>
