In agreement with the experiment, these calculations showed further decrease of the band gap with the rise of temperature. According to Mazurenko et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], the band gap disappeared at 386 K. These results suggest that, in FeSi, dynamic on-site correlations of Fe d-electrons are important for correct band structure description.
