<p>The LDPE sample was pressed by a plate vulcanization machine (Harper Electric Company of Harbin, Harbin, China) at 110 °C. The process was as follows: preheated for 5 min before pressurization, then pressurized 5 MPa every 5 min, and finally pressed at a maximum pressure of 15 MPa. The thickness of the sample utilized to test the DC breakdown was 60 μm, and the thickness of the sample utilized to test the conductance was 50 μm. The samples of LLDPE, MDPE, and HDPE were prepared in the same manner. However, the pressing temperature was changed to 150 °C. All the samples were made by depositing aluminum as electrodes on the vacuum membrane plate machine. Finally, the prepared electrode samples were placed in a vacuum drying oven for 24 h with 50 °C short-circuit temperature.</p>
