 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref> the results of ray-tracing calculations for this microscope. The three lens groups are indicated in (
 <italic>a</italic>), Gaussian and reciprocal planes are denoted in (
 <italic>b</italic>). A special objective lens designed for minimum spherical aberration forms the first 
 <italic>k</italic>-image in its back focal plane (BFP). The electron beam is transferred to the scattering energy of the spin filter (not shown here) by zoom optics 1 and to the desired drift energy in the imaging ToF spectrometer by zoom optics 2. Photoelectron momentum maps are taken simultaneously in an energy interval of width several electronvolts, limited by the chromatic aberration of the lenses. The simulations were based on the small footprint (∼20 µm) of the photon beam at P22, yielding a large depth of focus with ∼8 eV usable energy range. The large field of view in reciprocal space is imaged with negligible aberrations (the unavoidable field curvature is small). Time markers with 10 ns spacing (dots) reveal almost planar isochrones, an essential precondition for good energy resolution and no ‘crosstalk’ between longitudinal and transversal momentum components.
