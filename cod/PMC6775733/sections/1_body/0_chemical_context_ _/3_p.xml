<p>Additionally, the characteristics of spin transition in coordination compounds are known to be extremely sensitive to any changes in the chemical environment. As Hofmann clathrate analogues are very easy to modulate, numerous SCO complexes with very different temperatures, abruptnesses and hystereses of SCO were obtained. Moreover, the ability of Hofmann clathrate analogues to incorporate guest mol­ecules provided SCO-based chemical sensors (Ohba
