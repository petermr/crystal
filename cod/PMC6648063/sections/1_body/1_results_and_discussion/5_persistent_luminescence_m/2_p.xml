<p>The amount of V

 <sup>3+</sup> ions. Thus, the improvement of the persistent luminescence intensity is possibly due to the increase in the amount of V
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">″</sup>. However, different RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions affect the persistent luminescence of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> differently. Besides, the addition of Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> and Yb
 <sup>3+</sup> decreases the thermoluminescence intensity of the material, which indicates that the increase in the amount of V
 <sub>Ba</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">″</sup> is not the main factor that affects thermoluminescence. Therefore, it can be deduced that Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ions interact with the defects in the material. V
 <sub>O</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">••</sup> and Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> in the material can both act as the electron trap. Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> can improve the ability of the electron capture in the material, thus improve its persistent luminescence intensity. By observing the thermoluminescence intensity changing law (

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>c), we discover that the influence of RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions on the thermoluminescence intensity is closely related to the optical electronegativity of the rare-earth ions. The so-called optical electronegativity is the parameter of the ability that rare-earth ions attract electrons. The electronegativity is bigger, and the ability to attract electron is stronger. On the contrary, the ability to attract electron is smaller. Co-doped RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions can interact with other defects to capture an excited electron. Thus, the co-doped RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions can improve the energy storage ability of the material and then improve the persistent luminescence property of the material. Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>, Dy
 <sup>3+</sup>, and Nd
 <sup>3+</sup> ions improve the thermoluminescence intensity of the material drastically. The improvement of La
 <sup>3+</sup>, Tb
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>, Gd
 <sup>3+</sup>, Pr
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ho
 <sup>3+</sup>, Er
 <sup>3+</sup>, Yb
 <sup>3+</sup>, and Lu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions to the thermoluminescence intensity of the material is not obvious. After adding Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> and Yb
 <sup>3+</sup> ions, the thermoluminescence intensity of the material decreases on the contrary. This indicates that RE
 <sup>3+</sup> ions can improve the persistent luminescence intensity of the material within its optical electronegativity in an appropriate range. If the optical electronegativity is too small, then it cannot capture an electron with other defects effectively. If the optical electronegativity is too large, then the ability of absorption of electron is too strong to release the captured electron in the material. In this material, Sm
 <sup>3+</sup> and Yb
 <sup>3+</sup> ions possess large optical electronegativity. The captured electron cannot be released effectively, which leads to the decrease of thermoluminescence intensity in BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. The optical electronegativity of La
 <sup>3+</sup>, Tb
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ce
 <sup>3+</sup>, Gd
 <sup>3+</sup>, Pr
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ho
 <sup>3+</sup>, Er
 <sup>3+</sup>, Yb
 <sup>3+</sup>, and Lu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions is too small. They obviously cannot improve the thermoluminescence intensity of the sample.
