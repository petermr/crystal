 <caption> Strategies to generate emission contrast from photoaligned QR films. a,b) Two images are projected on one unidirectional aligned QRs substrate by polarized backlight through a VAN LCD, which facilitates to control 16 polarization azimuthal angles of individual pixels (200 µm × 200 µm). The inset image in (b) presents an array of pixels with 5 × magnification. c) In‐LC cell optically addressable emissive QR display. d) The patterns “N” and “R” with backlight under cross polarizers (upper part), and polarizer‐free emission patterns “N” and “R” with impinging light (λ = 450 nm) and 480 nm cut‐off color filter (bottom part).
