<p>Besides the energy considerations, a relevant difference between the H-bonding networks of the two phases could be detected in 
 <bold>form I</bold> having four adjacent H-bonded molecules, whereas 
 <bold>form II</bold> has only two, but double H-bonded, with one H-bonding site at the oxygen even unmatched. While the variation in the energetics is hardly justifying any differences in the dissolution behavior, the steric arrangement of H-bonding network in phenytoin 
 <bold>form II</bold> might be the cause of its increased aqueous dissolution rate.
