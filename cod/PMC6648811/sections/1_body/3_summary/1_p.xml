<p>In these studies, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new lipid-soluble photoNORM, the chromium(III)

 <sub>4</sub>. Visible light excitation of silicone polymer disks prepared from various biocompatible commercial formulations triggers the release of NO in quantities determined by the length of the excitation pulse. Thus, photouncaging from such an implantable device allows one to define the location, timing, and dosage for the release of this potent bioregulator. However, with the exception of a subcutaneous implant, such a device would need to be attached to an optical fiber owing to the relatively poor tissue transmission of visible light. To address this issue, we also report that including neodymium-doped β-NaYF

NIR photoexcitation of these UCNPs leads to the emission of upconverted visible light and activates NO release from the photoNORM. The mechanism of such photosensitization has not been determined, although it is likely that this occurs by “trivial” energy transfer, namely, the emission of light from the UCNP followed by reabsorption by the photoNORM.
