  <p>Characteristics of the cation displacements. 
   <bold>a</bold> Key partial pair-distribution functions for the refined PbMg
   <sub>1/3</sub>Nb
   <sub>2/3</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub> configuration. The Nb–O and Pb–O peaks are split, suggesting off-centering of the respective cations. In contrast, the Mg–O distribution exhibits a single symmetric peak. 
   <bold>b</bold> A stereographic-projection map of the Pb displacements demonstrating their preference for the 〈111〉 directions. (The black lines indicate traces of the {110} planes). 
   <bold>c</bold> A slice (at 
   <italic>z</italic> ≈ 0.17 Å) of the probability density distribution for the Pb atoms revealing the four maxima offset along the 〈111〉 directions. 
   <bold>d</bold> Magnitude of the Pb displacements as a function of the local Mg/Nb ratio around Pb. The inset illustrates the [PbO
   <sub>12</sub>(Mg/Nb)
   <sub>8</sub>] coordination. Pb, O, Mg, and Nb species are represented by the blue, light gray, red, and yellow spheres, respectively. The error bars represent single standard deviations estimated by analyzing three independently refined configurations
