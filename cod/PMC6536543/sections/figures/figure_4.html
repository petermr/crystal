 <caption> Selected room-temperature Raman spectra of powder Ca 5(Si 2O 7)(CO 3) 2. Pressures are indicated at the right-hand side. Intensity scales vary from spectral regions and it has been adapted for clarity as indicated in the top left side of each panel. Black is used for tilleyite, green for post-tilleyite, and blue for higher pressure phase. δ symbols denote bending modes and ν stretching modes, respectively. </caption>
