<p>Jiajun Luo et al., at the end of 2018, published work [
 <xref rid="B74-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] where authors showed that by the modification of the chemical composition of all-inorganic double perovskites, in particular, by alloying Na cations into Cs
 <sub>2</sub>AgInCl
 <sub>6</sub> via hydrothermal method, resulted in suppression the dark transitions. Thus, highly luminescent powders were obtained with PLQY up to 86%. It was shown that optimally alloyed Cs
 <sub>2</sub>(Ag
 <sub>0.60</sub>Na
 <sub>0.40</sub>)InCl
 <sub>6</sub> with 0.04% Bi doping perovskite emits warm-white light with luminance 5000 cd m
