<p>Fourthly, the quantitative validation of the surface topography model, especially the 3D surface topography model should also be particularly concerned in the practical application. The predication accuracy of the surface topography model is always evaluated by the difference between the measured surface topography and the simulated result. However, it is such to accurately match the corresponding points between the two profiles. To solve this problem, some researchers [

 <xref rid="B96-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] attempted to employ the 2D surface topography, i.e., the radial or circumferential surface profile to evaluate the prediction accuracy, which can be regarded as a local validation method. Meanwhile, some other researchers [

 <xref rid="B86-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] compare the surface roughness between the two profiles to validate the accuracy. However, this method is also not comprehensive since two different surface profiles may have the same surface roughness values. Hence, the global evaluation for the prediction accuracy of the 3D surface topography model should also be further explored.
