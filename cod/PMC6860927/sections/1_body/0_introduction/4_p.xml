<p>It follows that the information contained within atom probe detector hit maps on 1) the crystallographic orientation of each grain and 2) the position and shape of grain boundaries, can be combined to completely crystallographically define grain boundaries to 5 degrees of freedom [

 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This can then be further correlated to local atomic compositional variations [

This unique type of analysis can currently only be achieved with APT and it is invaluable to the understanding of nanostructure-property relationships in engineering materials. However, this type of analysis is typically done manually. It is slow and leaves too much room for individual interpretation, making it a source of significant quantification errors and reduced reproducibility.
