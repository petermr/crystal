<p>A second chemical design rule for finding novel functional materials is based on symmetry and crystal structure. Experience has shown that low-dimensional materials are ideal platforms for realizing topological electronic states due to the weak interlayer interactions and subsequent partial confinement of the electronic states that is frequently present.
