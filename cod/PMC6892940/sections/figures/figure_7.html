 <caption> Neutron diffraction measurements for x  = 1.0 composition: ( a) Neutron diffraction pattern for x = 1.0 recorded at 2 K and 300 K. Inset shows the enhanced intensity of the nuclear Bragg peak at 24° at 2 K. Rietveld refinement of NPD data for x = 1.0 at ( b) T = 2 K (considering magnetic structure). The solid line through the experimental points is the Rietveld refinement profile calculated for the space group P2 1/ n structural model. The vertical bars indicate the Bragg positions. The lowermost curve represents the difference between the experimental data and calculated results. </caption>
