<p>In the case of SCAS, the results are more interesting. First, it can be seen that the filling factor (index indicating the amount of mass of scatterers in the crystal) significantly affects the passage of sand. Thus, it can be observed that in the case of the thick SCAS, there is a 28.5% increase in the embankment of sand in its front part compared to what happens in the thin SCAS, with the filling factor of the first almost doubling that of the second (0.45 vs. 0.25). On the other hand, in the back part of the thick SCAS, the sand embankment produced is also larger than in the thin SCAS (11.6%). With these results, it can be concluded that increasing the filling factor in a SCAS will increase its sand accumulation capability and therefore its behavior will be more similar to that of classic ABs, increasing the “dune effect” that appears, with its maximum value in the front part of these last ones.</p>
