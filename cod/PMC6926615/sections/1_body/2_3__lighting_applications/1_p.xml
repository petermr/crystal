<p>The principle of light emission by LED is based on the spontaneous recombination of electron–hole pairs in the active material, which is typically a semiconductor [
 <xref rid="B66-materials-12-03845" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The radiative recombination can be carried through electroluminescence or photoluminescence. The latter is attributed to the down-conversion LEDs, where the emissive material or phosphor is excited optically by UV or blue chip. Taking into account such outstanding optical properties of perovskite materials as tunable in a wide range PL peak position, high PLQY, and small values of FWHM, there is no doubt that perovskites are promising for utilization as phosphors in LEDs. Indeed, just in the last few years, the luminance and external quantum efficiency of perovskite based LEDs increased their from 364 cd m
