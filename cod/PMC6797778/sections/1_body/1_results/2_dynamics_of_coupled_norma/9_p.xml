<p id="Par21">Secondly, a more realistic model that includes the damping of the normal modes was considered. The damping coefficients of

 <sub>

 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>IRy</italic>
 </sub> modes initially oscillate with small amplitudes at 0 K until the arrival of the first pulse at 0 ps (damping is turned on at 0 ps). The eight sequencial pulses are applied to substantially amplify the 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>LS</italic>y
 </sub> mode from the zero-point vibration at 0 K. The time interval between the subsequent pulses is gradually increased by ~4% from the 1/Ω
 <sub>
  <italic>LS</italic>
 </sub> ~ 1.6 ps for the phase matching between the pulse and 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>LSy</italic>
 </sub> mode, considering the increase in the period of 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>LS</italic>
 </sub> mode due to anharmonicity. Upon each cycle of pulse irradiation, the 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>LSy</italic>
 </sub> mode is coherently amplified by gaining kinetic energy. After the eight pulses are irradiated, the 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>LSy</italic>
 </sub> mode has sufficient kinetic energy and jump over the effective barrier which is reduced by the 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>IRx</italic>
 </sub> mode. Once the initial AB stacking sequence changes to the AC stacking, it maintains the AC stacking due to the dissipation of the kinetic energies of the vibrations. This corresponds to the AB → AC ferroelectric switching. The opposite switching operation, AC → AB, can be performed by the same optical input as illustrated in Fig.

 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>LSy</italic>
 </sub> mode in the AC stacking is reversed (−
 <italic>r</italic>

 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> direction) in the AB stacking. The optical parameters of pulses (e.g. 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and σ) used in this study might be optimized further for more efficient switching, for instance, via pulse shaping techniques
