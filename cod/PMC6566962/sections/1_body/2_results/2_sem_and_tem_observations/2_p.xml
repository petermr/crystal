 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a–d)</xref> shows SEM back-scattered electron images (BEIs) of microstructures in the two alloys with different nominal compositions quenched from different temperatures. While specimens with the Al-30.0 at.%Fe composition quenched from 300 and 1000°C both exhibit the η″ single-phase microstructure (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a,b)</xref>), those with the Al-31.0 at.%Fe composition quenched from these two temperatures exhibit two-phase microstructures consisting of the major η″ phase (dark region) and the secondary ζ phase (bright region) (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(c,d)</xref>). This phase identification is based on electron diffraction analysis (not shown). Hence, the Fe-rich side boundary of the η″-phase solid solubility region is between Al-30.0 and 31.0 at.%Fe.
