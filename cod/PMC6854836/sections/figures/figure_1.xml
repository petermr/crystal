  <p>Crystal structure of rhombohedral α-B
   <sub>12</sub> and its (major) “icosahedral boron-rich” derivatives. In the α-B
   <sub>12</sub> structure, icosahedral B
   <sub>12</sub> units are arranged as in a cubic close packing. (a) Arrangement of B
   <sub>12</sub> units within a close-packed layer. Intralayer 3c2e bonds involving equatorial B atoms are indicated as pink triangles. (b) Rhombohedral unit cell of α-B
   <sub>12</sub> with stacking of layers indicated. Terminal (exo) 2c2e bonds connecting icosahedra between layers are depicted as yellow lines. (c) In the binary/ternary derivatives, interlayer 3c2e bonds are replaced by terminal 2c2e bonds to interstitial atoms. From left to right: B
   <sub>4</sub>C ([B
   <sub>11</sub>C
   <sup>p</sup>]
   <sup>−</sup>[CBC]
   <sup>+</sup>), B
   <sub>6</sub>P ([B
   <sub>12</sub>]
   <sup>2–</sup>[P
   <sub>2</sub>]
   <sup>2+</sup>), B
   <sub>6</sub>O ([B
   <sub>12</sub>]
   <sup>2–</sup>[O
   <sup>+</sup>]
   <sub>2</sub>). The center of the interstitial atoms corresponds to the location of the octahedral void in the cubic close packing.
