<p>The holographic diffraction structure (HDS) is formed by the light fieldâ€™s impact on the photo-sensitive photopolymer media. Formation field has the form of a periodic distribution of illuminated and unlit areas (interference pattern). In the lighted areas under the action of radiation the photopolymerization process proceeds. Before the exposure, the composition was a homogeneous mixture of components, a gradient of concentrations of polymer, and monomer is formed in the media volume. It leads to diffusion of the monomer into the lighted areas and crowding out the components, not involved in the reaction, into the unlighted areas [
