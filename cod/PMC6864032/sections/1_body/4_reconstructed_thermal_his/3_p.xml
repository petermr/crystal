<p id="Par15">In summary, the scenario which best reproduces the cooling rates inferred from the intra-crystalline distributions that we measured in augites is that for which the pyroxenite lava flow occurs immediately after the peridotite (i.e. 0.1 year later). This time span is sufficient for the pyroxenite to blanket the peridotite and slow its cooling rate according to the measured closure temperature. The gabbro-pyroxenite lava flow occurs in a later stage with a minimum interval of 10 years after the emplacement of the pyroxenite.</p>
