 <caption> (a) Sc 3N@C 80·Ni II(OEP) crystal system used in the theoretical study, based on the X-ray data in ref. 7. In one fullerene cage the Sc 3N cluster is rotated along the Fibonacci sphere with sampling 120-nodes. In the second cage the Sc 3N cluster has a natural orientation. The order parameter Θ is defined as an angle between the atomic position captured in red and the Z-axis (black arrow). (b) Schematic illustration of potential energy minima reconstruction based on homogenous sampling (see text for details). </caption>
