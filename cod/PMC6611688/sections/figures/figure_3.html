 <caption> Probing ferroelectricity in a metal-gated WTe 2 thin film sample. ( A) Schematic of the experimental setup and geometry. Inset shows zoomed-in side view of the device structure. ( B) Topography image of the metal (Ti/Au)–encapsulated WTe 2 flake on a Si/SiO 2 substrate covered with a conductive buffer layer of Ti/Au. Inset shows the profile of surface morphology along dashed white line. ( C and D) Spectroscopic bias-dependent piezoresponse phase (C) and amplitude (D) hysteretic curves acquired through the top metal electrode gating the WTe 2 flake. ( E and F) Topography image showing zoom-in on the metal-gated WTe 2 (E) and the corresponding piezoresponse phase image (F). ( G) PFM phase image after application of a bias pulse of −2.5 V. </caption>
