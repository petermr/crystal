<p>According to the theoretical model outlined above, the resistivity upturn in LMO is caused by a reentrance of Umklapp interactions between the remnant mobile

 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>37</italic>
 </xref>)] arrangement of excitons (fig. S10). In one sense, the periodic arrangement of excitons helps to “complete” the Mott transition in near-commensurate LMO, i.e., the many body system uses its own multiorbital degrees of freedom to open a correlation gap and, hence, gain energy. Recalling that the formation of excitons is favored by long-range interactions and given that a 1D metal (in contrast to a metal in higher dimensions) is unable to screen long-range interactions, we conclude that this novel localization phenomenon can only take place in a 1D (Luttinger liquid) system–like LMO.
