<p id="Par9">For α-plutonium, in its theoretical structure, we compute the lattice dynamics in the harmonic approximation by evaluating forces associated with finite displacements of the atoms in a supercell. The method is referred to as the small-displacement method

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> we present the main result of this report, namely, our calculated α-plutonium phonon density of states together with results from inelastic x-ray diffraction

 </sup>. As displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the zero-temperature theory predicts (correctly) a smaller atomic volume than what is observed at room temperature. The difference can be corrected for by scaling the phonon density of states (quasi-harmonic approximation) and the result from this is also shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The effect of the thermal expansion is small, but it slightly improves the agreement with x-ray diffraction

 </sup>, that is actually very good. Only in the narrow 12–13 meV region is there discrepancy that definitely lies outside of the experimental error bars. The rather encouraging comparison between our model and experiment may not be surprising, however, considering that the DFT model produces good elastic constants for α-plutonium
