<p>Polyethylene is a partially crystalline solid, whose properties are highly dependent on the relative content of the crystalline phase and amorphous phase, i.e., crystallinity. Polyethylene is polymerized from monomeric ethylene. It is widely applied in the insulating material of power cables due to its symmetrical molecular structure without polar groups, which gives it excellent electrical and mechanical properties [

According to different polymerization methods, polyethylene can be classified into linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), medium-density polyethylene (MDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). LLDPE possesses a regular short-chain structure, and, although its crystallinity and density are similar to those of LDPE, the intermolecular force is larger. The macromolecules of LDPE have many branches, which cannot be closely and regularly arranged with each other. Moreover, its branching degree is high. Medium-high density polyethylene is a linear macromolecule with low branching degree and regular structure [
