<p>Although the mechanisms governing 
 <italic>single</italic> PT events have been extensively studied at a number of metal oxides, much less is known about how, and to what extent, 
 <italic>multiple</italic> subsequent PT events at the solid–liquid interface collectively contribute to long-range proton transport or proton 
 <italic>diffusion</italic> as we will call it from now on. The distinction between single and multiple events is important, as multiple proton transfer events do not necessarily lead to any proton diffusion, since protons can jump back and forth, or “rattle”, between the same pair of donors/acceptors multiple times. Nevertheless, proton diffusion 
 <italic>via</italic> the Grotthuss mechanism consists of a series of concatenated PT events. To what extent the short-range local structure, crystalline long-range order, and structural anisotropies of metal oxide surfaces determine the possible pathways for proton transport at the solid–liquid interface, is still completely unknown. Here, we will address these points by obtaining atomic-level insights into the structure and dynamics of the ZnO–liquid-water interface using molecular dynamics simulations.
