<p>Many aspects of this unusual phenomenon, described in more detail below, are found to be consistent with a new theoretical framework (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>) for LMO in which dark excitons (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>27</italic>
 </xref>), formed within the 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2g</sub> manifold close to the Fermi level, order at 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> and, through their interaction with the charge carriers, induce the upturn in the resistivity. Both the anomalous angular dependence of the MR and the peculiar two-stage character of an underlying order-by-disorder phase transition suggest new physics involving multiorbital degrees of freedom.
