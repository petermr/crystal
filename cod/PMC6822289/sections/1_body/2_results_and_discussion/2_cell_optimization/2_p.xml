<p>Given that more than 99% of the structures in the database converged, our three-stage DFT optimization routine is suitable for high-throughput calculations. For comparison, in a previous attempt of a systematic DFT-based geometry optimization of 2612 MOFs, only 879 (33.7%) successfully converged.

 </sup> In that case the unit cell dimension was not optimized, and no check was included for the band gap.
