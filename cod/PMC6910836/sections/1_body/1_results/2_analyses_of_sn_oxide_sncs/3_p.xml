<p>The bulk SnO
 <sub>2</sub> crystals show three Raman bands at 476, 635, and 776 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in a normal Raman spectrum, characteristic of a rutile-type Sn oxide structure (fig. S7), which were assigned to the 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>g</sub>, 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1g</sub>, and 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>2g</sub> vibration modes, respectively (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>25</italic>
 </xref>). In contrast, the SHINER spectra of the Sn oxide SNCs contained only a single intense but broad peak, with a maximum between 569 and 583 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This peak cannot be ascribed to any of the modes predicted by group theory. Sn oxide nanoparticles with sizes of 2 to 5 nm have been reported to exhibit unique vibrations in the range of 500 to 600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, accompanied by a sharp 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1g</sub> signal (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>32</italic>
 </xref>). In these literature, the broad peak was attributed to grain size, surface disorder, or amorphous structure effects, based on phenomenological considerations. Note that Ristić 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>33</italic>
 </xref>) ascribed a broad Raman band at 571 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to amorphous Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> hydrous oxide. However, a detailed assignment of these intrinsic vibrational characteristics has not yet been reported because of a lack of understanding of the vibrational assignments and structural details of nanoscale Sn oxides.
