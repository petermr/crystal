 <caption> For the CPFE data: ( a) Slices 1–3 drawn on the block represent the three sections along the X-axis (slice 2 being at the indent centre) on which the residual deviatoric elastic strains predicted by CPFE are shown in ( c) unimplanted sample and in ( d) helium-implanted sample. For the Laue data (Laue measurements in 14 ): ( b) Visualisation of the measured sample volume. Superimposed are the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as the slices on which the measured deviatoric elastic lattice strains in ( c) the unimplanted sample and ( d) the helium-implanted sample are plotted. With respect to the initial crystallographic coordinates, X is [1 −1 0] direction, Y is [1 1 0] and Z is [001]. Slices 1–3 in experiments and simulations are at the same spatial positions and data in ( c) and ( d) is displayed on the same length- and colour-scales. The dotted white lines through ( a) and ( b) represent the depth at which the line plots in Figure C.1 in the Supplementary Material were extracted. </caption>
