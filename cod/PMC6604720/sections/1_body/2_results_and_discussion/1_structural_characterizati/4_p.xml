<p>The effect of the doping ratio on the photoluminescence properties was investigated. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> presents the PL spectra of the Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>:Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> red phosphors fabricated at 60 min having various dopant ratios (λ
 <sub>Exc</sub> = 365 nm). Characteristic signals of the corresponding transition states of the Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ion are labeled with A, B, C, D and E to be able to track their changes with respect to adjusted dopant ratios. Initially, at the doping ratio of 2.5%, these signals are comparable with each other in terms of their PL intensity. However, as the doping ratio increases, all emission signals, especially the signals corresponding to A, C, and E, show a significant increase. The increase of the emission signals of A, C, and E show a trend to grow faster than the remaining B and D points. The change of these corresponding emission intensities as a function of doping ratio is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. In any case, these values are saturating with respect to doping ratio, which is expected since the possibility of incorporation of Eu ions into Y(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> is limited. This limit can be inferred from the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> as 25–30%. The effect of the doping ratio on the XRD reflection signals was explored. Since atomic size of Y and Eu is different, the highest reflection at 16° (2θ), corresponding to the (100) plane, was examined to determine if any shift is present for the samples of all doping ratios. The crystals that were prepared in 60 min were considered, and their peak positions as a function of the doping ratio are demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. The corresponding reflections at 16° are fitted with a Gaussian distribution, and then their exact location was registered. As the doping ratio increases, a slight shift of the reflections is observed. This shift may be the result of enlarging the lattice of the host crystal due to incorporation of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> ions (since it has a larger ionic radius (0.109 nm) compared to Y
 <sup>3+</sup> ions (0.104 nm)) [
