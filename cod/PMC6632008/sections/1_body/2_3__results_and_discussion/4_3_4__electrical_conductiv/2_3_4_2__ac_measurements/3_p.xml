<p>The electrochemical characterization shows the same behavior in all the temperature range: (1) an inductive process, product of the electrochemical equipment and Pt wires, (2) an ohmic contribution, i.e., the intersection of the spectrum with the x-axis due to the internal resistance of the LSGM electrolyte, and (3) two semicircles, representing the polarization resistance of the cathode. These last features suggest the presence of two internal processes occurring at the triple phase boundary (TPB): the first one, at high frequencies, corresponds to the electrode/electrolyte interfacial charge transfer resistance, and the second one, at lower frequencies, associated with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).</p>
