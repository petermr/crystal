<p>In the following, we discuss model 
 <bold>4</bold>, which is depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>, in more detail. The polar position is split into three sites, a Si position (Si
 <sup>p</sup>) and two boron positions (B
 <sup>p,Si</sup> and B
 <sup>p,B</sup>). Their refined occupancies are Si
 <sup>p</sup>: 30.8(1)%, B
 <sup>p,Si</sup>: 31.9(4)% and B
 <sup>p,B</sup>: 37.4(4)%, which yields the composition SiB
 <sub>2.64(2)</sub> for the crystal. Model 
 <bold>4</bold> accounts well for the various interatomic distances in the disordered structure (see 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>b and 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">6</xref>
 </xref>). Exo-bonds between polar atoms may occur between Si
 <sup>p</sup> and B
 <sup>p,Si</sup> atoms, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 1.958(2) Å, as well as between two B
 <sup>p,B</sup> atoms, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 1.771(4) Å. Note that only a Si
 <sup>p</sup>–B
 <sup>p,Si</sup> contact yields a meaningful Si–B interatomic distance and, therefore, one expects an equal—or very similar—contribution of these atoms to the polar site. This is indeed the case for model 
 <bold>4</bold>. Furthermore, the occupation of the Si
 <sup>p</sup> site is below 1/3, which also supports the model since short Si
 <sup>p</sup>–Si
 <sup>p</sup> contacts can be avoided. The implication of model 
 <bold>4</bold> is that reasonable distances are provided for all combinations [polar–polar–exo, polar–polar–skeleton, polar–equatorial–(skeleton)] upon Si incorporation into the polar position (cf. 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">6</xref>
 </xref>).
