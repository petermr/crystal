<p id="Par22">Major and minor elements were analyzed with a Cameca-SX50 electron microprobe with a fine-focused beam (1 μm diameter) operating in wavelength-dispersive (WDS) mode. Operating conditions were 15 kV accelerating voltage and 15 nA beam current; counting times were 20 s on the peaks and 20 s on the background. The following synthetic endmember mineral standards were used: diopside for Mg, ferrosilite for Fe, wollastonite for Si and Ca, chromite for Cr, corundum for Al, MnTiO
 <sub>3</sub> for Mn and Ti, and a natural albite (Amelia albite) for Na. X-ray counts were converted into oxide weight percentages using the PAP correction program (as in Fioretti 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
