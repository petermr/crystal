 <sub>3</sub>. They found that the easy axes of spin are different: [110] in PVO and [001] in BiCoO

 </sup> revisited the structural transitions in PVO using a series of X-ray diffraction measurements and first-principles calculations. They found that the C-AF insulating and NM metallic states are the ground states for tetragonal and cubic phases, respectively. They have also noted a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal-to-centrosymmetric cubic perovskite structural phase transition in the pressure range of 2.7â€“6.4 GPa.
