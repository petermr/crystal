<p>The unit cell of the η″ phase consists of two twin-related domains alternately stacked along the orthorhombic 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis. Each domain is formed with the motif structure having a fixed composition (Fe
 <sub>9</sub>Al
 <sub>21</sub> or Fe
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>7</sub>). Meanwhile, the twin boundary region has a different fixed composition (Fe
 <sub>6</sub>Al
 <sub>16</sub> or Fe
 <sub>3</sub>Al
 <sub>8</sub>), which gives rise to structural and compositional modulation to cause the splitting of superlattice reflections. Since the chemical compositions of the motif structure and twin boundary region are different from each other, that of the η″ phase may vary with the M value (i.e. how frequently the twin boundary region appears along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis stacking direction).
