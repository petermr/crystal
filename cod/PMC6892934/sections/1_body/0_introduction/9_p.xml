<p id="Par10">Here we consider a &lt;001&gt;-oriented tungsten single crystal, partly implanted with 3000 appm of helium at room temperature. Nano-indentation with a spherical indenter tip was done on both helium-implanted and unimplanted parts of the sample. The physical morphology of the indent surface and region beneath the indents was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron- microscopy (TEM) to assert the prior observations of helium-induced changes
