<p>APT specimens were fabricated from the grain boundary using an in situ site-specific lift-out method [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in a FEI Helios dual beam scanning electron microscopy / plasma focused ion beam (SEM / PFIB) instrument with a Xe source. Compared to the conventional Ga FIB, the Xe PFIB show faster material removal rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. More importantly, Ga is known to segregate at interfaces, especially at grain boundaries, during FIB-milling of aluminum and aluminum alloys. Using an Xe PFIB can avoid such ion implantation damage [

 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. During specimen sharpening, transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) was employed to locate the grain boundary within the needle-shaped APT specimen [
 <xref rid="pone.0225041.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] using an EDAX electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector and analyzed using the accompanying OIM software (version 7.3.1). APT experiments were conducted using a CAMECA LEAP 5000 XS instrument. It is a straight-flight-path device equipped with a local electrode. Voltage-pulsing mode was used to collect APT data with a pulse fraction of 15% and a pulse repetition rate of 250 kHz. The target detection rate was set at 1 detection event per 100 pulses while the specimen was kept at a base temperature of 60 K during the measurement. The corresponding reconstruction was crystallographically calibrated using the protocol described by [
