<p>As can be seen from the left figure, if the layer charge density is fixed, the difference in the substitution positions will significantly affect the distribution of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. When ion substitution occurred, mostly in tetrahedrons (0-6, 2-4, 3-3), Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> were shifted closer to the Z-axis due to their closer proximity to the substitution source, and the distribution was more uniform. A low peak appeared at a distance (2.8 Å) closer to the O
 <sub>t</sub>, but most of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> were still concentrated in the middle of the layer, about 5.5 Å from the O
 <sub>t</sub>. When the substitution source was mostly in octahedrons (4-2, 6-0), the radial distribution of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> was less affected due to the spatial long-range effect mentioned in
