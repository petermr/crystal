<p id="Par27">The droplets were imaged with an inverted bright field microscope (DMI6000B, Leica). The time-lapse images were acquired using a CMOS camera (HXG40, Baumer, 10 fps). Tracking was performed by adjusting the focus on the droplet manually. Experiments in which the droplets were out of focus were not included in the statistical analysis. The plane coordinates of the stage (TANGO Desktop, Märzhäuser Wetzlar) and the Z coordinate of the motorized objective lens (× 20, Leica) were recorded using Labview. The spiral droplets were allowed to move over at least twice the pitch before irradiation started. Confocal fluorescence imaging was performed with a using a Nikon confocal microscope and laser sources with
