<p>The results obtained are divided into two categories, which are undoubtedly interrelated and not independent, but which will be explained separately for a better understanding of the data obtained and a simpler interpretation of the results. First, the permeability of the different ABs and their effect on sand movement will be evaluated. This aspect is particularly interesting if SCASs are to be installed in desert lands, for example, in infrastructures, such as the AVE Medina-La Meca in Saudi Arabia (Haramain High Speed Rail o HHR). In this type of terrain, the placement of classical ABs, formed by walls, can result in significant sand accumulation that endangers the transport infrastructures for which they are designed. However, SCASs would allow sand to pass through them, thus avoiding sand accumulation and protecting the infrastructure. This first analysis will allow us to quantify these accumulations for both types of ABs, the classics and the SCASs, under controlled conditions, as well as to make a first evaluation of the goodness of the SCASs with respect to the classical ABs in this sense. On the other hand, it is necessary to analyze the effect of sand accumulation on the acoustic efficiency of the different ABs considered. For this purpose, the acoustic attenuation of each AB was measured in each of the cases studied: Before and after the movement of sand due to the airflow created in the scaled wind tunnel. However, as we indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-sensors-19-04881">Section 3.4</xref>, the quantitative comparison of both types of ABs is very difficult due to the different ways they work acoustically. Therefore, here, we can only compare qualitatively the effect of sand on the attenuation properties of the AB classics and SCAS separately. However, this first study on the relationship between the movement of sand and the change in the acoustic attenuation properties of SCAS versus classical ABs may be very interesting for engineers to select the type of ABs to be installed in communication infrastructures depending on the type of ground.
