<p id="Par19">Moreover, two other interesting observations are important for revealing the nanowire growth mechanism. The first one is from the comparison of the aluminum tooth shape shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>. After developing the shape as depicted by the dashed black line at 51.5 s in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, tooth #1 and #2 did not show visible growth from 51.5 to 70.5 s, while in this period, tooth #3 nucleated and grew up to a size comparable to #2. This suggests that tooth formation would completely stop once a new dent is formed between two teeth, i.e., the mass diffusion will not go across the dent. Actually, each tooth is a crystal starting its growth from the dented junction to inherit the lattice coherency. Second, a GB is observed inside the neck, as shown in the enlarged image in the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, clearly visible only when the crystal is suitably oriented. Its existence not only reconciles the lattice misorientation between the hot reservoir crystal and the newly formed crystal seeded by the cold tip, but also provide a diffusion path into the neck and atomic sink, such that deposition inside the neck can be realized, similar to the case with Sn

 </sup>. The kinetic barrier of plating into this GB sink (vis-a-vis that of surface diffusion) likely controls whether the overall wire growth kinetics is surface transport controlled or interfacial reaction controlled
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. Because our quantitative estimates indicate that major portion of the long-range transport driving force is counteracted by the back-stress gradient, and the back stress can be generated by inefficient GB sink actions that directly give volume change normal to the GB (put it another way, a stress normal to the GB drives GB plating/stripping, the original argument made by Herring
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>), we conclude our wire growth kinetics is interfacial reaction controlled, that is, the great majority of the thermomigration driving force is spent on driving the GB plating reaction via a self-regulated back stress normal to the GB. This is quite reasonable, because GB diffusion is significantly more sluggish than surface diffusion at these temperatures due to the smaller free volume inside GB, and when surface diffusion is serially coupled to GB diffusion/reaction, it is the latter that is likely to be rate-controlling.
