<p>The comparison of electronic band structures of transition-metal monosilicides of B20 (FeSi-type) crystal structure was performed on the basis of unified first-principle calculations supplemented by review of available theoretical and experimental data. We included our results for the band structures of TcSi, ReSi, and RhSn in generalized gradient approximation with accounting for spinâ€“orbit coupling, which we did not find in the literature. We discussed the influence of the band structure on their topological and thermoelectric properties.</p>
