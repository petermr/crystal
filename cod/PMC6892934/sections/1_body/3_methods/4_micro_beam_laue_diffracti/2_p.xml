<p id="Par37">The recorded images correspond to the total intensity scattered by the entire volume illuminated by the incident beam. The depth along the incident beam from which a specific diffraction signal originated is thus unknown. At 34-ID-E, the Differential Aperture X-ray Microscopy (DAXM) technique enables depth-resolved measurements. Here, a platinum wire is scanned in small steps between the detector and the diffracting sample. The depth vs intensity profile for each detector pixel is recovered by subtracting the diffraction images from consecutive wire positions and triangulating using the wire edge and the line of the incident beam. Detailed description of the DAXM technique and the 34-ID-E instrument is given elsewhere

 </sup>. For the present sample, material up to 20 µm beneath the ion-implanted surface was measured with 0.5 µm 3D spatial resolution. Laue diffraction patterns containing 30+ peaks were indexed and fitted using the LaueGo software package (J.Z. Tischler: tischler@anl.gov) to extract both lattice orientation and the full deviatoric lattice strain tensor at each measured point in 3D space.
