  <p>Simulated neutron diffuse scattering. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> Neutron diffuse scattering near the 
   <italic>h</italic>00 reflections (
   <italic>h</italic> is the horizontal axis) calculated for the refined configuration at 300 K with (
   <bold>a</bold>) all the species and (
   <bold>b</bold>) only the Pb atoms included in the calculations. 
   <bold>c</bold> X-ray diffuse scattering near the same reflections with all the species included in the calculations. The intensity traces correspond to the 
   <italic>k</italic>-positions indicated using white/dotted rectangles; the logarithmic intensity scales are the same as indicated in the corresponding color-scale bars. The neutron scattering in (
   <bold>a</bold>) is modulated relative to (
   <bold>b</bold>), featuring different appearance for the asymmetry of the 
   <italic>h</italic>00 reflections with 
   <italic>h</italic> = 2
   <italic>n</italic> and 
   <italic>h</italic> = 2
   <italic>n</italic> + 1. This modulation, which is associated with the correlated oxygen displacements, reproduces the experimental results reported in ref. 
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
   </sup>, even though the present refinements did not include neutron diffuse scattering
