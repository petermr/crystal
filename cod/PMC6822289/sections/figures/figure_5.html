 <caption> Energy profile during the optimization workchain for COFs (a) 05000N2 and (b) 05001N2. Conventional names are COF-1 and COF-5, and the starting configurations of the layers, as reported, 2 are staggered and eclipsed, respectively. The three colored regions of the plot correspond to the first cell optimization with constrained cell angles and 20 steps maximum (red), the NPT AIMD at 400 K/1 bar for 50 fs, i.e., 100 steps, (yellow), and the final cell optimization without constraints (green). The energy is shifted to assign a 0 value to the minimum. </caption>
