<p>All SEM investigations were performed in an SEM JSM-7000F from JEOL that is equipped with an l-N
 <sub>2</sub> cooled Inca energy-dispersive detector from Oxford Instruments. For EDX analysis, a low acceleration voltage of 5 kV was employed to decrease the characteristic X-ray generation volume and thereby receive better resolution and more reliable EDX data from the low 
 <italic>Z</italic> elements (i.e., boron) in the sample. Images were generated using information from secondary electrons or backscattered electrons at a working distance of 15 mm and at a medium high probe current setting (7 in the instrument settings). EDX probing was performed at a work distance of 10 mm with a high probe current setting (14 in the instrument settings). The specific difficulties in obtaining quantitative analysis of Si/B ratios with EDX are discussed in the
