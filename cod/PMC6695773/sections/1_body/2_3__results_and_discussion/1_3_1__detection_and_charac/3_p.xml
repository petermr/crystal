<p>Lattice d-spacing changes of (110), (200) and (201) peaks of powder Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn hexagonal D0
 <sub>19</sub> phase during in-situ cooling and heating processes were indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f004">Figure 4</xref> respectively, in which the d-spacing value was calculated according to Bragg equation of: 
 <italic>2d</italic> × sinθ 
 <italic>= nλ</italic> on the basis of a set of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn powder XRD profiles. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f004">Figure 4</xref>, D0
 <sub>19</sub> (110), (200) and (201) planes show obvious peak splitting into two new peaks during cooling from 320 K to about 93 K, while two new peaks also merge to the original D0
 <sub>19</sub> peak during the following heating process. Thus, this symmetry-breaking phase transformation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn is proved to be reversible with a hysteresis of 10–30 K. For example, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02484-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, lattice d-space of D0
 <sub>19</sub> (110) at the temperature higher than room temperature (~300 K) is about 2.96 Å and splits into two new peaks at 270 K, d-spacing of one new peak increases and d-spacing of the other peak decreases as the temperature further goes down. It is noted that d-spacing increases during cooling indicating a negative thermal expansion (NET) of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Sn in a certain temperature range. NET is generally known and occurs in zeolites, metal oxides, Aluminum phosphates, and so on [

 <sub>3</sub>Sn is currently unknown and needs to be studied in the future.
