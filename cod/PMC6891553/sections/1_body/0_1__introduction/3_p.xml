<p>Following this line, in this paper, we present a qualitative study to analyze the variation of the noise attenuation performance of different kinds of SCASs as a function of the sand accumulated in their basis, comparing these results with those obtained with a classical AB. To this end, we used an integrated photogrammetric-acoustic method consisting of (i) SLST to carefully determine the sand levels accumulated at the base of the different ABs analyzed, and (ii) an environmental acoustic measurement system to obtain the noise attenuation for each of the proposed cases. Furthermore, using this integrated method, we established a qualitative relationship between the movement of the accumulated sand and the attenuation obtained in all cases. </p>
