<p id="Par11">We now consider the possible origin of the EG of CHO/STO. Since CHO, unlike LaAlO
 <sub>3</sub>, is non-polar, one can exclude the classic polar discontinuity and electronic reconstruction scenario
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. An alternative plausible scenario is the strain-induced polarization and electronic reconstruction, as proposed by a theoretical study
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> and experimentally observed at the heterointerface of CaZrO
 <sub>3</sub>/STO
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. However, the B-site atom displacement vector maps of CHO/STO (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>) show that the atom displacements are tiny and random, and the resulting net out-of-plane polarization is within the detection error of our STEM measurement. Furthermore, the absence of a critical thickness and the inertness to polar solvents are unexpected from a strain-induced polarization mechanism. Therefore, we conclude that the EG of CHO/STO is unlikely to originate from the strain-induced polarization in CHO films.
