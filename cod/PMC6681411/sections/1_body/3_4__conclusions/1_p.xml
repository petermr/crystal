<p>In this work, the atomic structure and electronic structure of LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl were studied based on the first principles calculations. LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl was shown to be a wide-gap insulator with a calculated band gap of around 5 eV. The results from the AIMD simulation show that a delithiation process starts to occur and leads to the formation of Li
 <sub>1-x</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl
 <sub>1-x</sub> (0 &lt; x &lt; 1) at temperatures higher than ~450 K. As a result, the Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions start to become mobile as inferred from the change of the partial coordination number (PCN), whereas the Al–O coordination was stable until 1100 K. Based on the structure of LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>Cl, the two most probable pathways for the Li diffusion were chosen and the analysis of the calculated results lead to two low energy barriers, one within the LiAl
 <sub>2</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub> layers and the other between such layers. The calculated large diffusion coefficient,

 <sub>6</sub>Cl material at 500 K suggests a high Li

 <sup>+</sup> ions together with the high stability of the [Al

 <sub>6</sub>] framework indicate that the title compound may be technically important as a superionic conductor at high temperatures.
