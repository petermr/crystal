 <xref rid="pone.0221569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were used for this study. Most specimens stored at the Kyoto Collection were acquired when pregnancy was terminated for socioeconomic reasons under the Maternity Protection Law of Japan. Parents provided their verbal informed consent to have the specimens deposited in the collection, and participant consent was documented in each medical record. Written consent was not obtained from all parents. Samples were collected from 1963 to 1995 in accordance with the regulations relevant at each time. Some of these specimens were undamaged and well-preserved fetuses. The aborted fetal specimens were brought to the laboratory, measured, examined, and staged using the criteria proposed by O’Rahilly and Müller [
