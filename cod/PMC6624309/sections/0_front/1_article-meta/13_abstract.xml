 <p id="Par1">We present a two-dimensional (2D) parity-time-symmetric (
  <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry) phononic crystals (PCs) with balanced gain and loss medium. Using the super cell method of rectangular lattice, we exhibit the thresholdless spontaneous 
  <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry breaking in the band structure. The numerical results show that the asymmetric scattering properties obviously occur in a non-Hermitian system. At two specific incident frequencies, unidirectional reflectionless and perfect transmission behaviors exist individually in opposite directions, which are accompanied by a phase transition of π. Based on the generalized Snell’s law, combining such a 
  <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric medium, we design a novel metamaterial crystal for 
  <italic>PT</italic>-symmetric acoustic flat focusing. Its focus frequency can also be modulated by the gain/loss parameter. The novel flat focusing based on the 
  <italic>PT</italic>-symmetry that we propose opens a new door for high-dimensional applications of non-Hermitian metamaterials in acoustic wave manipulation.
