<p>ToF-ARPES spectrometers work for initial energies in the soft X-ray range with a resolution of ∼10
 <sup>3</sup> (Kühn 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb36"> ▸</xref>). Owing to the high resolution at energies up to ∼100 eV, this family of instruments is very well suited for the analysis of small-momentum objects in 
 <italic>k</italic>-space at rather low kinetic energies. Scanning of a full Brillouin zone would involve sample rotation.
