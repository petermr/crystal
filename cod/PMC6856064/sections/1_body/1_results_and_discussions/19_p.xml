<p id="Par21">Finally, we evaluated the power consumption of our newly designed configuration. It is worth pointing that when compared to the conventional 1B-Y LEDs, our 1UV2B-GR LEDs consume less power, even our 1UV2B-GR LEDs consist of one UV and two blue LEDs. The power consumed by our 1UV2B-GR LEDs is 69 mW, which is slightly lower than the power consumed by conventional 1B-Y LEDs (71.3 mW). The power consumption was calculated when both the LED PKGs were operated under a forward current of 25 mA. The newly designed LED PKGs are having a high efficacy of 100 lm/W, high CRI points above 95, and high durability will find applications in artificial stadium lighting, UHDTV production, and applications where highly efficient and high color rendering WLEDs are required.</p>
