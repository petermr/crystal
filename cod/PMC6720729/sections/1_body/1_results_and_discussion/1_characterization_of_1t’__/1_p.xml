 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> shows the typical orthorhombic crystalline structure of 1Tâ€™-WTe
 <sub>2</sub>. The tungsten atoms deviate from the ideal octahedral sites in the octahedron due to the very strong chemical bonding, forming the distorted octahedral structure. Consequently, the Te atom layers become buckled in the distorted octahedral structure.
