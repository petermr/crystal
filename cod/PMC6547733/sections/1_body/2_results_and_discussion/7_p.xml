 </sup> complements and deepens our understanding of the effect of structure and composition on electronic excitation induced amorphization in ceramics. Especially, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows that the evolution of transition temperature with excitation concentration for the monoclinic layered perovskite LTO has a similar slope compared to the other titanate pyrochlores, while cubic LZO pyrochlore exhibits a steeper slope. This suggests that a chemical change of the 
 <italic>B</italic>-site cation affects more strongly the slope of the transition temperature as a function of excitation concentration, compared to a chemical change of the 
 <italic>A</italic>-site cation. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> also shows that cubic pyrochlores are more resistant to electronic excitation than the monoclinic perovskite LTO structure, as evidenced by their higher transition temperatures. In the specific case of a comparison between La
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> and Gd
 <sub>2</sub>Ti
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, experiments have shown that the perovskite structure amorphizes more rapidly than the pyrochlore structure

 </sup>. This is in agreement with LTO having a lower crystalline-to-amorphous transition temperature compared to Gd

 <sub>7</sub>.
