 <sup>(2)</sup>, the 3D NPC structure is theoretically designed according to the computer-generated-hologram method. In the experiment, we have successfully fabricated different 3D nonlinear grating structures to produce the target SH vortex and HG beams. The generated SH beam profiles agree well with the theoretical predictions. The most unique characteristic feature of our 3D NPC is its ability to realize the desired nonlinear beam shaping and full QPM simultaneously. In our experiment, the conversion efficiency of SH beam shaping is enhanced up to two-orders of magnitude in comparison to the previous 2D cases. Considering that our 3D LiNbO
 <sub>3</sub> NPC is only less than 100 μm in length, such enhancement is substantial. In addition, the conversion efficiency can be further improved by upgrading the laser writing system to fabricate a mm-long 3D NPC. Our experimental configuration provides a useful platform to fully utilize the advantages of 3D NPCs, which can be further extended to generate other types of nonlinear beams, nonlinear holographic imaging, and high-dimensionally steered photon entanglements
