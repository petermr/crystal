<p>For electrochemical investigations, a potentiostat (±10 V, 400 or 240 mA with low-current channel) is available. Specialized cells for liquid or solid electrolyte cells are under development. Boron nitride (BN) sleeves mask parts of the cell outside of the desired sample. A custom sample stick may be used to place the cells inside the cryofurnace, which allows moderate heating (Song
