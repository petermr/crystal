<p>This direct observation and identification of two types of twin boundary in ZnO nanospikes presented herein provides complementary information to previous plan-view studies by Hrkac 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> ▸</xref>). Those authors presented an in-depth discussion of the origin of HRTEM superposition contrasts, as well as identification of twin planes

 <italic>P</italic>1
 <italic>m</italic>) and the SPS constructed by Hrkac 
 <italic>et al.</italic> are depicted in Figs. 8
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>c</italic>) and 8
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>(

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>c</italic>)] arise because of the implementation of the single planar twin defect in the model which introduces additional lattice periodicity.
