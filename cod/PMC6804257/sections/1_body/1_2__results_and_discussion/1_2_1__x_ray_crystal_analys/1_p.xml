<p>The formation of macrocycle H
 <sub>2</sub>L14 shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f001">Figure 1</xref> was confirmed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and mass spectroscopy. The conclusive confirmation was obtained by X-ray crystal analysis. The structure is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03556-f002">Figure 2</xref>, and the crystal data collection and structure determination are summarized in
