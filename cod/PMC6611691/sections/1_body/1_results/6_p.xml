<p>To gain deeper insight into how the asymmetry develops with increasing 
 <italic>B</italic>-field, we have performed a series of MR sweeps as a function of magnetic field oriented at multiple angles within the 
 <italic>ac</italic> plane. 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> shows results for a nonsuperconducting sample mounted with 
 <italic>I</italic>//
 <italic>a</italic> at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 1.2 K. (Again, almost identical behavior in a superconducting sample is plotted in fig. S6). In the low-
 <italic>B</italic> regime (
 <italic>B</italic> &lt; 5 T), Δρ(
 <italic>B</italic>) follows a quadratic dependence in field and scales approximately as 
 <italic>B</italic>cosθ (θ measured from the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis), albeit with a small negative offset, suggesting that it originates from the effects of the Lorentz force. With increasing field, the MR starts to deviate from its quadratic dependence and passes through a maximum at 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub> ~ 14 T (for 
 <bold>B</bold>//
 <italic>c</italic>), indicating the emergence of a negative MR component to Δρ(
 <italic>B</italic>).
