<p>Here, we study the effect of Zn(II) on the photophysical properties of the mixed cations and mixed halide (FA
 <sub>0.85</sub>MA
 <sub>0.15</sub>)Pb(I
 <sub>2.85</sub>Br
 <sub>0.15</sub>) perovskite thin films made by one-step deposition in air. In addition, we apply an amine hydrochloride additive to our perovskite, and its effect on film formation and morphology is studied. The introduction of Zn(II) results in a prolonged film stability under ambient conditions, enhanced photoluminescence (PL) and extended PL lifetime, without affecting the band gap. The main challenge for producing perovskite films from a solution is to obtain a uniform, continuous, and compact layer. For this purpose, a common and straightforward method is to apply chloride-based additives. In this study, we apply 3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride (3-CPACl) which allows to produce highly crystalline, oriented, smooth, dense, and pinhole-free layers. Furthermore, the perovskite can also be prepared from our precursors as pellet-able black powder by a solid–solid reaction under ambient conditions.
