<p>And referencing to Piezo Systems Company the unit price for one transducer of QB220-503YB is 265$, for 5 transducers is 186$, for 25 transducers is 144$, for 100 transducers is 127$, meaning that the total cost of 2483 transducer units (where each unit consists of 690 transducers costs 889$ as they considered approximately 7 groups of 100 transducers which cost 127$) at each station is about 2,207,390$ [
 <xref rid="pone.0219373.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and this proposal cost considered to be very expensive compared to the small amount of energy produced by these number of transducers and short powering interval, in addition to that it would take a long time to give its payback.
