<p>Close inspection of the observed multiplets suggested that they could be assigned to a pair of AB spin systems with very similar chemical shifts and coupling constants. Notably, the chemical shifts at approximately −42 ppm are almost identical to those of the P−P bonded dimeric species [Cp*Fe(η
 <sup>5</sup>‐TPP)]
