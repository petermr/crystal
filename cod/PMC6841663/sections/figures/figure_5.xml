  <p>Correct answer rate (i.e., accuracy) for combination of features selected by SFS. The accuracy increases with respect to 
   <italic>N</italic> and the number of features. For 
   <italic>N</italic> = 4, 5, and 6, an increase in the number of features up to four effectively improves the accuracy. The addition of the fifth feature does not improve the results. For 
   <italic>N</italic> = 8, the accuracy is saturated with two or more features. For 
   <italic>N</italic> = 12, the accuracy is almost ideal regardless of the number of features. The condition 
   <italic>N</italic> = 8 with two features and the condition 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 with four features is close to the accuracy of the condition 
   <italic>N</italic> = 12.
