<p id="Par24">It is interesting to correlate the CSE values to the DFT total energies for a group of generated model structures. We investigated this in the case of those Au
 <sub>36</sub>(SR)
 <sub>24</sub> and Ag
 <sub>44</sub>(SR)
 <sub>30</sub> model structures that have the molecular composition of the true cluster but not necessarily the true structure. The correlation of the CSE to the total energy is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref> for gold and silver, respectively. The result shows a clear trend: the total energy decreases when the CSE decreases. This confirms that the minimum energy structures can be found most probably among the model structures that have low CSE values. The larger fluctuations at low and high energies seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> are related to the decreased number of model clusters in sampling on both extremes. This comparison confirms the validity of CSE in predicting the true structure.
