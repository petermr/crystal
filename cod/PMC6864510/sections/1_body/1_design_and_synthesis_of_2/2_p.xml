<p>Dimensions of perovskites can be controlled by selecting different organic ligands and metal halides. The orientation of the inorganic thin layers is dependent on the geometry and noncovalent bond interaction of spatial cations, and the number of inorganic layers is directly determined by the stoichiometric ratio.[qv: 13a]</p>
