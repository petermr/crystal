<p id="Par21">To clarify the atomic motion at the neck region with GB during the thermomigration process, direct molecular dynamics simulations with temperature gradient were performed with and without pulling load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We measured atomic displacement and time-averaged mean square atomic displacement (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), such as atomic diffusivity, of each atom during the simulations. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> shows the atomic displacement vector of each atom during the simulation. Long-distance displacement/diffusion primarily occurs on the neck region surface and substrate surface, and even in the GB. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> shows the axial component (direction along temperature gradient) of the displacement vector. Under the both loading conditions, atoms on the surface diffuse from high temperature to low temperature region, and some of them diffuse into the GB. The atomic diffusivity of each atom was also calculated (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). The atomic diffusivity in the GB is relatively lower than on the surface, i.e., GB plating process is sluggish. In addition, from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, the pulling load promotes the atomic diffusion both on the surface and in the GB.
