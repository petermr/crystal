<p>The occurrence of some rod-like particles in the black samples is in fact due to the high reactivity of the particles while exposed to the electron beam during the TEM observation. Indeed, the focalisation of the electron beam for a few seconds to a few minutes on agglomerates of primary particles clearly leads to a very sudden and unexpected dissociation of the agglomerates and the growth of numerous rod-like crystallites, which are scattered around the initial agglomerate and then partially destroyed (
