<p id="Par49">In this work, we have studied a system of active particles in the presence of soft-core repulsive interactions, a coarse-grained model for suspensions of activated complex polymers, such as dendrimers or star polymers. We explored how the active force affects the cluster-crystal phase of the system. We discover the existence of traveling cluster crystals, with a speed induced by the active force. The crystal moves coherently in space, for a typical time which depends on the persistence of the active force, maintaining its hexagonal structure. In addition, the cluster-shape is deeply affected by the strength of the active force which determines its size, until producing an unstable region where at first clusters can exchange particles and then destroy and reform continuously in time. Finally, for large enough self-propulsion, the crystal melts. We have checked in specific cases that such a phenomenology is not restricted to our choice of interparticle potential and we expect it to be present in a large class of soft-core interactions. We explore two different modelizations of the active force, both well-known in the literature, exploiting analogies and differences between them. Besides some differences in the particular parameter values at which transitions occur, the only feature which distinguishes the two descriptions is the cluster shape: for some values of the control parameters they display a central hole in the ABP case, but not in the AOUP. We have explained in detail the reasons for this difference.</p>
