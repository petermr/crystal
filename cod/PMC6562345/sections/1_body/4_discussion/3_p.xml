<p>On the other hand, in 
 <bold>CdGF</bold>, the difference in the DFT N · 
 <italic>s</italic>O distance between the two energy minima is 0.11 Å, four times the corresponding value in 
 <bold>MnGF</bold>. Moreover, the absolute DFT N · 
 <italic>s</italic>O distance in the putative orthorhombic phase, 2.99 Å, is substantially larger than the DFT value from any experimentally observed phase (2.87 Å to 2.91 Å). Thus it seems that the hypothetical orthorhombic unit cell in 
 <bold>CdGF</bold> is both too large and too rigid to allow effective hydrogen bonding.
