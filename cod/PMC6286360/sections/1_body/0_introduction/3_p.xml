<p id="Par5">Recently, we reported the design and synthesis of 3D COFs bearing pyrene

 </sup> units, starting from tetrahedral and quadrilateral building blocks connected through [4 + 4] imine condensation reactions. According to these results, we believe it is reasonable to construct other 3D COFs via this topology design. Therefore, we decided to choose the representative AIEgens, tetraphenylethylene (TPE)

 </sup>, as the quadrilateral core to synthesize AIEgen-based 3D COFs.
