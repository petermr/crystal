<p>According to the unit cell model shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>c, square fiber was used for mathematical simplicity. In the finite element simulations, both cylindrical fiber and square fiber were investigated so as to explore the effect of fiber shapes. The effective properties of the unit cells are shown in
