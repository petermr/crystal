<p>MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> was obtained by high‐pressure, high‐temperature synthesis between 5(1) and 10(1) GPa upon heating to temperatures between 1173(120) K and 1373(150) K before quenching to ambient conditions (see the Supporting Information). Thin samples prepared from crude ingots by the focused ion beam (FIB) lift‐out technique
 <xref rid="anie201907432-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> were investigated with transmission electron microscopy by means of selected area electron diffraction data for structure solution (see the Supporting Information).
 <xref rid="anie201907432-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Refinements of X‐ray diffraction data were performed with the crystallographic program package WinCSD.
 <xref rid="anie201907432-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Electronic band structure calculations (Figure S4) and bonding analysis of MgSi
 <sub>5</sub> were carried out using the experimental values of lattice parameters and atomic coordinates (Tables S3 and S4) employing the program package TB‐LMTO‐ASA (see the Supporting Information).
