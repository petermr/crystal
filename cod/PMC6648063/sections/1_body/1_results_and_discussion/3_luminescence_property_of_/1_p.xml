 </xref>a provides the excitation and emission spectra of the sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>. By the excitation of 365 nm ultraviolet light, the sample BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> can emit intense yellow luminescence as well. The emission spectrum is a broad-band spectrum ranging from 450 to 470 nm, which belongs to the 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup> → 4f
 <sup>7</sup> transition emission of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. The emission spectrum includes two emission peaks, which are the main emission peak located at 580 nm and the weak emission peak located at 500 nm. The co-doped sample is synthesized in the reducing condition. Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> has been reduced to Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (no 4f → 4f characteristic transition emission peak of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> observed around 610 nm).

 </sup> The added Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion is difficult to be reduced; therefore, it still exists in a trivalent ion form.

 </sup> There is no characteristic emission peak of the Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion in the emission spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup>. Thus, in the co-doped sample, Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> acts mainly as the assistant activating agent rather than the luminescent center. The two emission peak positions of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> are the same as the emission peak position of BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, which indicates that the crystal environment of the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> luminescent center does not change much after the Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> ion is involved. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a, BASO:0.3Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>,0.1Tm
 <sup>3+</sup> can also be excited by the light with the wavelength from 250 to 520 nm, belonging to the 4f
 <sup>7</sup> → 4f
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup> transition of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. This declares that the sample can be activated by ultraviolet and blue light-emitting diode (LED) chips, which is very important for the application of long persistent luminescence materials.
