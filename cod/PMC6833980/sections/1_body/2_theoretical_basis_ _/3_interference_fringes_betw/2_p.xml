<p>In Fig. 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>(
 <italic>b</italic>), as IFRB emitted from A
 <sub>2</sub> are observed in the range of 
 <italic>x</italic> from around 5.5 to 8.5 mm, they are attributed to the interference fringes between the once-reflected beam (
 <bold>S</bold>′
 <sub>2</sub>) and the twice-reflected beam (
 <bold>S</bold>′′
 <sub>4</sub>) from the back surface. The beam once reflected from the back surface is called the beam in the BbB mode hereafter, since it is incident on the entrance surface (A
 <sub>0</sub>) satisfying the boundary condition of the Bragg mode, reflected from the back surface (B
 <sub>1</sub>) satisfying that of the Bragg mode and emitted from the entrance surface (A
 <sub>2</sub>) satisfying that of the Bragg mode. It is possible for these beams to interfere with the beam in the B5bB mode. But the amplitude of the beams in the B5bB mode is much smaller than that in the BbB mode, because the amplitude becomes small after each reflection from the entrance or the back surface. In the following, the contribution of the beam in the B5bB mode is ignored.
