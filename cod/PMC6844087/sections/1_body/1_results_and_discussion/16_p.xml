 </xref>. In the number percentage representation, there is almost no difference between the size distribution of the nanoparticles prepared at different conditions. The resolution of the measurement is bigger than the difference produced for the different conditions. The mean value of these distributions is 93.3 Â± 0.7 nm. This result, together with the previous Scherrer calculation, suggests the formation of a polycrystalline microstructure, as the mean particle size is greater than the mean crystallite size. On the other hand, by studying the volume percentage distributions, it is clear how the distribution is progressively shifted to bigger diameters as the calcination intensifies. Even though it consists of the superposition of different peaks, the main distribution has a clear dependence on the thermal treatment. Consequently, the effect that the thermal treatment has on sintering between particles is demonstrated.
