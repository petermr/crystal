<p>All the curves exhibited a short elastic regime for the first few picoseconds, followed by entering the primary creep and steady-state (secondary) creep stages, and most curves entered the tertiary creep stage. At a temperature of 1200 K, the creep phenomenon of different grains under different stresses was as follows: for the nanocrystalline NiAl model with a grain size of 6.5 nm, no tertiary creep was observed under 1.5 Gpa and 2.0 GPa, except for that under 2.5 GPa. For the nanocrystalline NiAl model with a grain size of 4.5 nm, the phenomenon is consistent with the grain size of 6.5 nm, while the strain rate is higher. For the nanocrystalline NiAl model with a grain size of 3.8 nm, no tertiary creep was observed under 1.5 Gpa, except for that under 2.0 GPa and 2.5 GPa. When the temperature was raised to 1400 K, the creep phenomenon of different grains under different stresses was as follows: for the nanocrystalline NiAl model with a grain size of 6.5 nm, no tertiary creep was observed under 1.5 Gpa, except for that under 2.0 GPa and 2.5 GPa. For the nanocrystalline NiAl model with a grain size of 4.5 nm and 3.8 nm, tertiary creeps were observed under all stress levels, and the smaller the grain size, the faster the strain rate.</p>
