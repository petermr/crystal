<p>There has been considerable recent interest in developing strategies for photolysis-induced release (photouncaging) of various bioactive small molecules at physiological targets for potential therapeutic applications.

 </sup> One such molecule is the promiscuous bioregulator nitric oxide (NO), which plays important roles in mammalian cardiovascular and neurobiology as well as immune response

 </sup> to the design and study of photoactivated NO-releasing moieties (photoNORMs). The advantages of photouncaging include exquisite control of the timing, location, and dosages of delivery. However, two disadvantages come immediately to the forefront. The first is the difficulty in localizing the caged bioactive molecule at the desired target area, where release can be triggered with light. The other is the rather poor transmission of ultraviolet and visible wavelengths through mammalian tissue with the exception of the relatively narrow window falling at long visible and shorter near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths.

 </sup> Not only do shorter wavelengths penetrate poorly but the resulting tissue heating from the absorption of these wavelengths can also lead to collateral damage.
