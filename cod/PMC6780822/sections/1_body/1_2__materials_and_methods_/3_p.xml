<p>Measurements of OLED properties were performed by recording current–voltage characteristics as well as electro-luminescence (EL) spectra. The current–voltage was acquired using a Keithley 236 voltage source unit, while the EL intensity and spectral characteristics of the devices were measured with a calibrated silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan, S5227-1010BQ), a photomultiplier tube, and a spectroradiometer (Minolta, Osaka, Japan, CS-1000).</p>
