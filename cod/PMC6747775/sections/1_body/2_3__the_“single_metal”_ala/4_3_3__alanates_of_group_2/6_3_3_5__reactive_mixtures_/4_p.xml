<p>Hanada et al. reported the dehydrogenation of Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + Si, Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + 2MgH
 <sub>2</sub>, Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + 2LiH, and Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + 2LiNH
 <sub>2</sub> mixtures that were produced by manual or ball milling [
 <xref rid="B226-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. In their work, Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> was produced by a metathesis reaction and it was used without purifying, i.e., with the load of NaCl. The weight losses were 6.1 wt.% for Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + 2MgH
 <sub>2</sub> and 5.5 wt.% for manually milled Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + 2LiNH
 <sub>2</sub>. These values were reported without taking the load of NaCl into account. The rest of the hydrogen release values were not clearly specified. For the Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + Si mixture, the first two reactions are the usual Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> dehydrogenation reactions, Si does not react with CaH
 <sub>2</sub> or Ca-containing phases [
 <xref rid="B226-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. For the Ca(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> + 2MgH
 <sub>2</sub> mixture, after the usual first two dehydrogenation reactions, MgH
 <sub>2</sub> decomposes at around 270–350 °C and then reacts with Al to form Al
 <sub>12</sub>Mg
 <sub>17</sub> [
 <xref rid="B226-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Alapati et al., by means of first-principle calculations, arrived at the same reactions, plus a high-temperature reaction [
 <xref rid="B227-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]:
 <disp-formula>6CaH
  <sub>2</sub> + Al
  <sub>12</sub>Mg
  <sub>17</sub> → 17Mg + 6Al
  <sub>2</sub>Ca + 6H
  <sub>2</sub> (~600 °C)
