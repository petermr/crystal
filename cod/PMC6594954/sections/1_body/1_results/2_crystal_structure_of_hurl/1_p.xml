<p id="Par10">At ~83 GPa the crystal structure undergoes another phase transition, which is reflected in an abrupt change of the unit-cell parameters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The high-pressure phase hurlbutite-III preserves initial 
 <italic>P</italic>2
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>c</italic> symmetry. The phase transition to hurlbutite-III is displacive and induced by the final incorporation of O8* atoms into the coordination sphere of P1. At 83.2 GPa polyhedra of penta-coordinated P1 and Be2 possess trigonal bipyramidal geometry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) with two long apical (1.662–1.813 Å for P1 and 1.711–1.798 Å for Be2) and three short equatorial bonds (1.471–1.506 Å for P1 and 1.492–1.545 Å for Be2; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The O–T–O apical bond angles are 10.5˚ and 11.5˚ away from the 180˚ required for the regular trigonal bipyramid for P1 and Be2, respectively. The P2 and Be1 atoms remain tetrahedrally coordinated up to 82 GPa, so that the framework of hurlbutite-III is built upon TO
 <sub>4</sub> and TO
 <sub>5</sub> polyhedra sharing common vertices. The structure of hurlbutite-III contains distorted elements of both hexagonal and cubic packings (HCP and CCP, respectively), where the P1 and Be2 atoms fill trigonal bipyramidal voids and the P2 and Be1 atoms fill tetrahedral voids. Ca has 11-fold coordination manifesting distortion from an ideal close packing.
