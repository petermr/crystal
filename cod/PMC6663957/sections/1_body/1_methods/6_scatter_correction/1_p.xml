<p id="Par40">The scatter estimation was performed using the current implementation of single scatter simulation (SSS) algorithm in STIR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] where the Klein-Nishina cross-section is used to calculate the probability of Compton scattering as a function of scattering angle. We calculated the down-sampled single scatter sinograms given: (i) the activity image which was reconstructed from non-scatter corrected data, (ii) the attenuation map, (iii) the attenuation map down-sampled with a factor of two, (iii) the scanner down-sampled with a factor of two in axial and transaxial directions keeping the same inner radius, (iv) the energy resolution of 20% similar to the simulation setup, (v) and the energy window of 350–650 keV. Then the result was up-sampled and fit to the activity image using Trispline interpolation. The down-sampling speeds up the process while it does not affect the final result significantly as the scatter distribution varies slowly with the detector pair.
