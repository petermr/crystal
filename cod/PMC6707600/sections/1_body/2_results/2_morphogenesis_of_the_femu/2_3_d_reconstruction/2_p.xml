<p>As previously mentioned, the femoral neck was constricted and the femoral head and greater trochanter were discernable by the end of the embryonic period (CS23 [CRL of 26.8 mm]) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221569.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The lesser trochanter was detected in embryos with a CRL of 26.8 mm (CS23), which became sharp in fetuses with a CRL of 37.2 mm. The greater trochanter and trochanteric fossa became evident in fetuses with CRL between 33.5 and 40.0 mm. The femoral head fovea was identified in fetuses with a CRL of 40.0 mm, which became obvious in fetuses with CRL between 37.2 and 45.0 mm. No particular changes at the proximal epiphysis were noted in fetuses with a CRL of â‰¥45.0 mm.
