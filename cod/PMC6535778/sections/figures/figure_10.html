 <caption> Angle-resolved photoemission study of the band structure of EuSn 2P 2. (A, B) Band dispersion spectra along K−Γ–K taken with 76 and 96 eV photons differ mostly in the relative intensities of the bands due to photoemission selection-rule effects. (C) Incident photon energy 102 eV, shows a wide energy-range band dispersion spectrum along M−Γ–M. </caption>
