<p id="Par27">Once the 3-class classification model was created with the 1934-dataset, the remaining 16738 points were individually classified using the newly established data model. As a result, the crystalline structures classified with 100% accuracy into the crystal class. Meanwhile there was a minor confusion between the amorphous and the liquid classes, with the liquid class having 99.8% accuracy and the amorphous class a 98.9% accuracy. In total only 55 structures were classified within a class different than the EM cluster to which they belonged. This is shown in the confusion matrix given in TableÂ
