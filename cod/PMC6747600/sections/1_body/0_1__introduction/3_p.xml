<p>The thermoelectric properties and band structure of CoGe within a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) full-potential approach were studied in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The magnetic and superconducting properties of RhGe and its band structure were investigated in Refs. [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-02710" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with a GGA plane-wave approach. The band structure of RhSn, taking into account the spinâ€“orbit coupling, has not, to the best of our knowledge, been calculated.
