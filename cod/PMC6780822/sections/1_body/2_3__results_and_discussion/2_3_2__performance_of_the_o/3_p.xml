 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the relative luminance of OLED devices with the implemented YSZ nanoparticle scattering layer compared to the control device without the scattering layer. In the presence of the scattering layer, the total luminance and luminance in normal direction of the OLED device enhanced, compared to the reference device without the scattering layer. At the thickness of scattering layer, 2.5 μm, a 29% enhancement of total luminance and a 38% enhancement of luminance in normal direction were achieved. As the result, the optimal thickness of the scattering layer was observed at 2.5 μm. Moreover, the luminance enhancement is not proportional to the increase of the scatter effect. As the thickness of scattering layer was increased, the luminance decreased. This means that the transmittance of the thick scattering layer lowers as the thickness increases. To analyze optimal thickness of the scattering layer implemented in the OLED device, the luminance change was simulated using a geometrical optics tracing method. The LightTools program (Synopsys, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used for the simulation. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-f005">Figure 5</xref>a shows, the simplified device structure used for the simulation also approximated constant values of parameters such as the refractive index and the thickness of each layer. The maximum luminance enhancement was calculated as 32% enhancement at a thickness of 2.5 μm, in good agreement with the experimental result. Moreover, the maximum luminance enhancement in normal direction was calculated as 42% at the center of the device.
