 <p>In the title polymeric complex, {[FePt(CN)
  <sub>4</sub>(H
  <sub>2</sub>O)
  <sub>2</sub>]·2C
  <sub>3</sub>H
  <sub>6</sub>O}
  <sub>
   <italic>n</italic>
  </sub>, the Fe
  <sup>II</sup> cation has an octa­hedral [FeN
  <sub>4</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>] geometry being coordinated by two water mol­ecules and four cyanide anions. The Pt cation is located on an inversion centre and has a square-planar coordination environment formed by four cyanide groups. The tetra­cyano­platinate anions bridge the Fe
  <sup>II</sup> cations to form infinite two-dimensional layers that propagate in the 
  <italic>bc</italic> plane. Two guest mol­ecules of acetone per Fe
  <sup>II</sup> are located between the layers. These guest acetone mol­ecules inter­act with the coordinated water mol­ecules by O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds.
