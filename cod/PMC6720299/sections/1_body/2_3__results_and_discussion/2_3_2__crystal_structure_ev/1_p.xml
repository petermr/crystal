<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the atomic snapshots were colored as per CSP along with the corresponding radial distribution function (RDF) of a nanocrystalline NiAl model with 4.5 nm grain size under the stress level of 2.0 GPa during the creep processes at 1200 and 1400 K. The central symmetry parameter (CSP) is used to distinguish the degree of broken inversion symmetry as compared to each atomâ€™s local environment for a specimen under the creep deformation process. The color scale on the right expresses the degree of crystal structure damage from 0 to 15; when the value of CSP is 0, it is a perfect crystal, and the figure is represented by dark blue. The color from blue to red reflects the extent which the crystal structure was destroyed. In the atomic snapshot of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the dark blue part represents the crystal structure while the green part represents the grain boundary structure. This is also clear from the snapshots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The amorphization of the model was initiated at the grain boundary atoms, where the diffusion of grain atoms was more dominant at the grain boundary than the crystal structure arranged neatly inside the model. The amorphization process then moved from the grain boundary toward the inner part of the grain as the creep deformation proceeded. From another perspective, with respect to creep temperatures, the formation of an amorphous structure occurred earlier at 1400 K compared to 1200 K. It could be seen that NiAl gradually lost its crystallinity with the progress of creep deformation, and the amorphization was more obvious after 40 ps at 1400 K, as evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref>d. The nanocrystalline NiAl model at 1200 K had a more complete crystal structure than that at 1400 K. These observations may be due to the fact that grain boundary diffusion or lattice diffusion occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures during the creep deformation process.
