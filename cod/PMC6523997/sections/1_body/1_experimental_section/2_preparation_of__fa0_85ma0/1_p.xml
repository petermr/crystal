<p>MABr ( 0.18 M), FAI (1.02 M) and PbI
 <sub>2</sub> (1 M) were dissolved in DMF. In order to study the effect of Zn(II), 2.5 % of ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> was also added (0.025 M). A third precursor solution was prepared including 2.5% of ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> and 2% of 3-CPACl (0.008 M) to study the effect of the amine hydrochloride additive in combination with Zn(II).
