<p>The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program and refined with SHELXL [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] within the Olex2 graphical environment [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Due to the low completeness of the experimental data, the atomic displacement parameters of the carbon atoms in the final structural models had to be restrained to fulfill the Hirshfeld test along the covalent bonds (RIGU instruction in SHELX [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-01107" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]).
