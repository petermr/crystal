<p>Although 2D perovskite solar cells are at their start‚Äêup stage, and the dielectric and quantum confinement effect plus carrier transport limit the PCE, they present excellent environmental stability far beyond 3D perovskites because of their unique layered structure. So, 2D perovskites lay the foundation for 2D/3D hybrid optoelectronic devices and will have a great potential for the solar cell commercialization.</p>
