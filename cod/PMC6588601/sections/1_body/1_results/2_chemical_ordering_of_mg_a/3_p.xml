<p id="Par11">We used a local short-range ordering metric, 
 <italic>η</italic>, calculated similarly as described in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, to visualize a spatial distribution of the ordered regions. A 3D map of this metric for the refined configuration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) reveals the CORs, which appear as the quenched spatial fluctuations of the order parameter, while the degree of ordering varied continuously across the system. We compared our results with those inferred from the experimental STEM images by calculating a (110) projection of our configuration box, with the projected atomic columns assigned intensities according to their average atomic numbers (
 <italic>Z</italic>) squared. The resulting image, which we call a 
 <italic>Z</italic>-map, approximates the 
 <italic>Z</italic>-contrast in STEM high-angle annular dark-field images (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). The Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of this 
 <italic>Z</italic>-map yields the ½½½-type superlattice diffuse spots like those obtained experimentally. Comparison of the calculated map and the experimental image, both FFT-filtered using these spots, demonstrates their qualitative agreement (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Moreover, a map of the 2D ordering metric (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), calculated exactly as suggested in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, closely matches a similar map obtained by these authors from the experimental images (the thickness of their TEM samples was comparable with the dimension of our configuration box along the projection direction). Therefore, we concluded that the presently obtained models accurately represent the state of ordering in PMN and have adopted them for further refinements of atomic displacements (performed without any swap moves); the same Mg/Nb distribution was used for both 300 K and 200 K since the metal-ion diffusion at these temperatures is negligible.
