<p id="Par23">Compared with existing methods of nanowire synthesis, this method has advantages in making high-aspect-ratio free-standing nanostructure in a pristine and controlled way, which is a long-standing challenge. For example, photolithography can only fabricate in-plane patterned structure; nano-imprinting usually requires a hard mold to produce free-standing straight nanowire array, but the subsequent de-molding process can often destroy or contaminate the nanowire array. Our method also opens a new avenue to engineering/constructing nanostructures. For example, by using a movable metal tip as the hot source, i.e., a thermo-stylus, arbitrary structures can be deposited on cold substrate, in a way similar to 3D printing. Such additively manufactured 3D nanostructures can be directly used as single-nanowire probes
