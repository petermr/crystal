<p>Besides the ‘intrinsic’ obstacles (low cross section, strong phonon scattering, diffraction), the strong retardation of the fast photoelectrons to the pass energy of the analyser constitutes a technical problem which limits performance. This can most readily be seen from Liouville’s theorem, describing the conservation of the phase-space volume in particle optics. The three relevant phase-space ‘coordinates’ are electron velocity (proportional to

Assuming a radius of the central beam of 200 mm, an energy resolution of 125 meV (typical for HARPES experiments) requires combinations of pass energy and slit width in the range 30 eV/2 mm to 200 eV/0.25 mm. As a typical example, we consider a deceleration from 6.5 keV to 100 eV, the square root of the ratio yielding a factor of 8. According to equation (1)
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1"/>, the energy reduction must be paid for by an increase of the beam size by a factor of 8. In other words, the accepted area on the sample surface is an order of magnitude smaller than the width of the entrance slit.
