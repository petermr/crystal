  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic presentation of the normal incidence model, which is composed of an 8-layer cell structure: four loss regions and four gain regions. The reflected and transmitted acoustic waves from the left/right incidence are indicated by the red/blue arrows. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Reflection coefficient (green dotted line) in the non-dissipative system and transmission (black solid line) and reflection coefficient of the left-incident (red solid line) and right-incident (blue dashed line) waves in the non-Hermitian system.
