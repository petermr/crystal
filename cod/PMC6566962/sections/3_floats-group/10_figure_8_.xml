  <p>(a) Schematic illustration of the atomic arrangement in the commensurate long-period η″-phase structures for M = 7–23. For simplicity, it is assumed that the Al3-equivalent sites are occupied exclusively by Al atoms, while the Al2-equivalent sites are occupied evenly by Fe and Al atoms (50%:50%), except for the Al2-equivalent site closest to the twin boundaries that are occupied exclusively by Al atoms. The positions of the Al2- and Al3-equivalent sites (orange and green circles) are schematically arranged in a straight line for simplicity. (b) 00
   <italic>l</italic> systematic row in the SAED pattern with the [100]
   <italic>
    <sub>Cmcm</sub>
   </italic> incidence, calculated with the above atomic arrangement. (c) Approximant structures of the incommensurately modulated structures of the η″ phase with M = 13 (Al-29.3 at.%Fe) and M = 21 (Al-29.4 at.%Fe) as deduced by Becker and Leineweber [
