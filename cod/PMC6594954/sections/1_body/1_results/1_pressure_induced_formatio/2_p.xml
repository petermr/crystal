<p id="Par7">Conventional continuous contraction of unit-cell parameters and atomic bonds is observed up to 7.5 GPa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The compression of the unit cell is anisotropic so that the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis is the most and the 
 <italic>a</italic> axis is the least compressible (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In agreement with earlier reports on the compression of similar frameworks
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>, the compression of hurlbutite is controlled up to 7.5 GPa by changes in T–O–T angles of the tetrahedral framework, while the TO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra stay as rigid units.
