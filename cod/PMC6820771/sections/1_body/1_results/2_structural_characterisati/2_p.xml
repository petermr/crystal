<p id="Par11">Previous studies have suggested changes in morphology and/or composition as the origin of enhanced catalytic activity in TMDCs. For example, prior work on the metallic polymorph of TaS
 <sub>2</sub> attributed the improvement of the overpotential value after 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles to substantial morphological changes after the cycling process

 </sup>. To test whether any morphological changes were occurring in our case; we collected scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the material both before and after cycling. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows that the microcrystalline morphology is preserved after cycling. Furthermore, EDX mapping after cycling shows Mo and Te to be well distributed throughout the material (Supplementary Fig.
