<p>A one-dimensional Raman scan acquired along the length of the TSL NW studied in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref> is displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>. The spatially resolved investigation allows monitoring the changes in the Raman spectrum ensuing from the changes in the period of the TSL. Here, the period length decreases with increasing position in the vertical scale. In 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b, we display two representative Raman spectra extracted from the map in the positions indicated by the arrows in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a. In the top part, the period is smaller and thus the intensity of the TSL folded-originated modes (E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> and the modes between TO and LO) is higher. In the bottom part, where the gold droplet is located, and the NW is slightly tapered, the LO mode is enhanced. This happens in all our measurements (see, e.g., 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01775/suppl_file/nl9b01775_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information Figures 6 and 7</ext-link>). The LO enhancement is due the presence of the gold nanoparticle. Indeed, metal nanoparticles can affect the electromagnetic near-field profile in the surrounding region, thus rendering forbidden modes greatly enhanced, a phenomenon very well-known for molecular samples in surface enhanced Raman scattering applications.

 </sup> The map confirms that where the period is smaller, the intensity of the TSL folded-originated modes (E
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup arrange="stack">H</sup> and the modes between TO and LO) is higher.
