<p>Electronic band structure determines not only topological but also, to a large extent, transport properties. Many considered monosilicides were studied as thermoelectric materials. They can be divided into three classes. In the semimetallic monosilicides of Co and Rh, there is no energy gap near the Fermi level, but the density of states at
