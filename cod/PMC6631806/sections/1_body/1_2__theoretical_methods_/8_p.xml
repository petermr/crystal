<p>It should be noted that there is no need for a Lagrange multiplier to suppress compressibility. Solving Equation (3) and (7–9) for all j-constituents fulfills SCFT based on the suggested Edwards Hamiltonian for the compressible block copolymers. The bulk density 
 <italic>η</italic> of the disordered copolymer at a given T and P come into play in order to describe pressure effects.
