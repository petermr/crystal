<p id="Par6">Here in this work, we show that K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is the first Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doped NIR phosphor under 460 nm blue light excitation and gives a broad-band emission peaking at 740 nm in the NIR region (600–900 nm). Structural and spectral analysis results indicate that the selective Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> site occupation in LuO
 <sub>6</sub> and K2O
 <sub>6</sub> polyhedrons contributes to the NIR light emission in K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. The as-fabricated phosphor-converted LEDs have the potential to be used for non-visible light source, and the result could initiate the exploration of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doped NIR phosphors and other NIR spectroscopy applications.
