<p>The vast majority of commercial delivery robots are controlled by magnetic induction or optical tracking. Such robots consist of a head unit, trunk assembly, and robotic arm. The literature [
 <xref rid="B2-sensors-19-04980" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] proposed a daily life assistance robot with projection function. The literature [
 <xref rid="B3-sensors-19-04980" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] designed a front-desk service robot named “Black Bot” with voice control function. The robotic arm usually holds an object and its main body moves along a guide rail. The main body consists of a controller, a battery, motor drives, and a voice interface. The guide rail with magnetic strips can reflect photoelectric beams. Positioning and obstacle avoidance are achieved by a tracking device in the body. The disadvantages of this approach are as follows. Poor environmental adaptability: In a barrier-free environment in the laboratory, the robot performs well. However, in an actual restaurant, its anti-interference ability is poor [
 <xref rid="B4-sensors-19-04980" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, it is vulnerable to light and surface stains. Such external interference can severely affect the operation of the robot. High installation and maintenance costs: Current delivery robots work only in accordance with a preset trajectory, which has to be installed along a track on the ground. This will not only affect the layout and appearance of the restaurant but also increase installation costs. Inflexible service schedule: If the moving schedule is changed, the path needs to be re-laid, which is usually infeasible.
