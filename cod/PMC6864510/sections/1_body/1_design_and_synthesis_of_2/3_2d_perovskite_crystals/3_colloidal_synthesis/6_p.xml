 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SnBr
 <sub>4</sub> through this method.
 <xref rid="advs1307-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> The product was obtained by swiftly injecting a preheated SnBr
 <sub>2</sub>–TOP solution to an ODE solution containing quantitative OAc and oleylamine ligands at 180 °C protected by N
 <sub>2</sub> gas. The reaction continued for 10 s, and then an ice bath was used to stop it. Finally, the product was obtained by adding hexane and then centrifuging. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) confirms a periodic diffraction pattern with a regular interval of 2.3° at small angles derived from the periodic 2D structure, similar to the previous reports.[qv: 15a,25a,52] This perovskite material with high fluorescence efficiency was used to make LEDs.
