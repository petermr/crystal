<p>In order to further analyze the interaction between Si-O surface and water molecules in interlayer domain, we calculated the number of hydrogen bonds and the adsorption energy of Si-O surface to water molecules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f009">Figure 9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03997-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). It can be seen that the number of hydrogen bonds and the adsorption energy to water molecules also increase with the increase in the charge density of montmorillonite. It indicates that the water molecules in the montmorillonite with higher charge density are subjected to stronger polar force, and more and more H
 <sub>w</sub> is diverted towards the Si-O surface, forming more hydrogen bonding with the O
 <sub>t</sub>. Due to the influence of the polar force and hydrogen bonding force, Si-O surface of montmorillonite with higher charge density has higher adsorption energy to water molecules, which further indicates that the higher the layer charge density of the montmorillonite, the more difficult it is to hydrate.
