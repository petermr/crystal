<p id="Par7">Regarding the crystal structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>), LiO
 <sub>4</sub> and SiO
 <sub>4</sub> tetrahedra connected to each other by corner- and edge-sharing to form a highly condensed three-dimensional framework with the degree of condensation 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1 that is equal to the atomic ratio (Li, Si): O, and three different cations, K1, K2/Na2, and Na3, are filled in vierer ring channels along [001]. All of these ions are coordinated with eight O
 <sup>2−</sup> ions forming cubic polyhedrons with high-symmetry characteristics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). For example, the high-symmetry 4/
 <italic>m</italic> of the K1 and K2/Na2 sites lead to almost ideal cubic coordination with equal 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>(Na,K–O)</sub> bond lengths and with a difference between some 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>(O–O)</sub> only (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which strongly contribute to the as-observed narrow emission bands, as discussed below. The Na3 site has a relatively low symmetry of –4, and the bond lengths 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>(Na3–O)</sub> divide into two groups, leading to distorted cubic coordination. The alkali metal ions replaced by Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> would lead to an increase in positive charge of the unit cell; hence, the charge compensation can be associated with the formation of vacancies in cations instead of anions, such as 2Na
 <sup>+</sup> → Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> + V
 <sub>Na</sub>, 2 K
 <sup>+</sup> → Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> + V
 <sub>K</sub>, Li
 <sup>+</sup> + K
 <sup>+</sup> → Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> + V
 <sub>Li</sub>, and Li
 <sup>+</sup> + Na
 <sup>+</sup> → Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> + V
 <sub>Li</sub>. The numerous different combinations prevent reliable determination of the mechanism, and therefore, we do not speculate about it. However, these substitutions and as-formed vacancies will not have a strong influence on the Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> cuboid-like coordination with the relatively stable first coordination sphere of O
 <sup>2−</sup> ions.
