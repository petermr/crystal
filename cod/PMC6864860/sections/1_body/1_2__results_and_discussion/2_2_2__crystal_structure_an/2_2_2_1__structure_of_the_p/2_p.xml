<p>The CNA molecule contains a nitro group as a hydrogen-bonding acceptor and an amino group as a hydrogen-bonding donor. Those substituent groups transform CNA into a sort of “traffic hub” that holds together the interaction network from the different parts of the co-crystal. The two components are stabilized by the C-H···π and the C-H···O hydrogen-bonding interactions over a distance of 3.797 and 3.767 Å (

 <sup>3</sup> hybridization with an H-N-H angle of 108.5°, which results in the formation of the hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of the PROG molecule. This value is close to the ideal hybridization angle of 109.5°. Moreover, the nitro group and the benzene ring of CNA are almost co-planar and they present a small dihedral angle of 6.594°. This angular deviation from an ideal co-planar situation decreases with the degree of conjugation between the nitro group and its benzene ring. This may be caused by the formation of the C-H···O hydrogen bond between the CNA homo-molecules and the hetero-molecules of CNA and PROG. Such a chemical conjugation enhances the stability of the 3D structure of the co-crystal, which is consistent with its calculated solid structure. Moreover, an

 <xref rid="molecules-24-03936-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), enhances the stability of the 3D structure of PROG-CNA. The overall stability of this co-crystal is strengthened by the α···π interactions occurring between the hetero-molecules of CNA and PROG. Hirshfeld surface analysis also shows the notable interactions, including the α···π, π-π, and weak C-H···O interactions [

Interestingly, CDA (6-chloro-2,4-dinitroaniline), which is a molecule similar to CNA and contains one extra nitro group, forms vanillin isomer co-crystals. These structures are believed to form 1D-zipper-type tape upon dentate meshing and to generate a 2D-layer-type structure. Subsequently, these layers stack in an antiparallel fashion via weak π-π interactions that eventually build a layer-stack-type 3D structure. The 3D structure formation process of PROG-CNA is instead quite different and mostly influenced by the non-planar structure of the PROG backbone. Initially, a T-shape unit is located between two nearly vertical PROG molecules, which arrange themselves in a tail-to-tail fashion, while the structure assumes a sandwich conformation and an intermediate layer characterized by a linear shape-arrangement of coupled CNA molecules.
