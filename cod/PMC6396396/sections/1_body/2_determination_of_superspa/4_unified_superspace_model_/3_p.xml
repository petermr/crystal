<p>In Section 3.1
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.1"/> it was mentioned that a characterization of different Al/Si ordering patterns for comparison in physical space is not straightforward to assess. Modulation functions, bond lengths and other parameters of crystal chemical interest can be easily compared in superspace independent of the composition. A comparison of the Al/Si ordering patterns of M25 #2, M33 #1, M40 #1 and M50 #1 shows that the modulation functions of Al2 and Si2 on the 
 <italic>T</italic> site are very similar in terms of the displacive modulation, the number of required atomic domains and the occupancy block wave parameters (Fig. 8
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>). This simple comparison of atomic domains directly indicates that the Al/Si ordering pattern for the different compositions is the same in superspace and thus the rules for how Al and Si are ordered in physical space are also the same. Here, the focus lies on the occupational modulation and the displacive modulation is not further considered for the sake of simplicity. The parameters of the block wavefunction as a function of the composition are defined in Table 4
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4"> ▸</xref>. The use of M25 #2 instead of M25 #1 is justified by the small energy difference of 0.3 meV/atom between the two ordering schemes. Furthermore, M25 #1 requires three Al and three Si domains to describe the 
 <italic>T</italic> site in superspace and the Al/Si ordering pattern cannot be extended to compositions with 
 <italic>x</italic> ≥ 1/3 because it collapses if dicluster chains are not present. An animated figure of the unified superspace model like Fig. 7
