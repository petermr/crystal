<p>The crystal structure of BiOCl is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01296-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. It is clear that the BiOCl compound was crystallized in a tetragonal matlockite structure. The Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> atom coordinated to a square antiprism with four O atoms on one side and four Cl atoms on the other side. The [Cl-Bi-O-Bi-Cl] layers were stacked together by van der Waals interactions between Cl atoms along the c-axis [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01296" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The interplanar lattice spacing between two Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> ions in BiOCl layers was found to be 4.85 Ã…. Since the radius of Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> is similar to that of Pr
 <sup>3+</sup>, Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions can be easily doped into the lattice and successfully replace the position of Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> ions without any structural changes. The XRD results and the discussion of crystal structure indicate that the Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> ion could be doped into the BiOCl host at Bi
 <sup>3+</sup> sites.
