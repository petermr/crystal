<p id="Par20">Subsequently, narrowing the potential range so that only the edges are oxidized, the effect of the intact basal plane can be analysed. Cycling nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub> between −0.4 V and +0.65 V (vs. NHE) 100 times results in an identical overpotential shift from 320 mV to 175 mV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Thus, it is clear that oxidation of the edge sites has no impact on the overpotential improvement, and that the edges have no role in the activation mechanism. Further studies into the role of the edge sites are discussed in the Supplementary Discussion. On the other hand, when the potential range is extended to include oxidation of the basal plane, the catalyst becomes deactivated. This then indicates that the basal plane is responsible for the activation of nanocrystalline 1T′-MoTe
 <sub>2</sub>.
