<p id="Par23">The first DAC was gradually compressed to ~57 GPa, while the single-crystal XRD has been measured only for one crystal at five selected pressure points (namely at 5.8(5), 27.9(5), 35.9(7), 44.5(5), and 57.1(6) GPa). Then, the cell was decompressed with ~5–10 GPa pressure step, and due to sample deterioration, only wide images were measured.</p>
