 <caption> Neutron diffraction measurements for x  = 0.0 composition: ( a) Neutron diffraction pattern for x = 0.0, recorded at 2 K and 300 K. No magnetic Bragg peaks are observed. ( b) Rietveld refinement of NPD data at 2 K. The solid line through the experimental points is the Rietveld refinement profile calculated for the space group P2 1/ n structural model. The vertical bars indicate the Bragg positions. The lowermost curve represents the difference between the experimental data and the calculated results. </caption>
