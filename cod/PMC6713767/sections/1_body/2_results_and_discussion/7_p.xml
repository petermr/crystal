<p id="Par27">To optimize the property of zeolite-3A: 1.3 wt% Eu phosphors and observe the effect of Eu element on PL, the PL emission spectra and relative PL intensity for different stoichiometric amounts of zeolite-3A and Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. It can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a that the emission intensity of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> increases with doping concentration of Eu
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> increasing from 0.9 to 1.3%. However, it decreases with the continuous increase of the dopant concentration. It can be observed clearly that the PL effect is the best when the Eu-doping concentration is around 1.3%. It can be explained that the more Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, the more luminescent centers. When the concentration of Eu element is beyond 1.3%, the decrease of PL intensity can be attributed to concentration quenching, which is mainly caused by the energy transfer between Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. When the concentration of Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions increase, the distance among Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions will be short, and then, the energy transfer will increase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The error bar curve of relative PL intensity versus Eu-doping concentration is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b. It indicates that the change range of relative PL intensity for each Eu concentration is small, meaning that these samples are very repeatable.
