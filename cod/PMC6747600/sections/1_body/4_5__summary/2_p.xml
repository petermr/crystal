<p>From this point of view, the most interesting monosilicides are semimetallic CoSi and RhSi. The symmetry of a B20 (FeSi-type) crystal structure determines the existence of four- and sixfold band crossings at the

 </inline-formula> and 
 <italic>R</italic> points of the Brillouin zone. In CoSi and RhSi, the Fermi level is close to these band crossings and, at the same time, it is close to the minimum of the density of states. Thus, their topological properties should not be strongly obscured by contributions from other bands. For example, they demonstrate well distinguishable, elongated surface Fermi arcs, connecting projections of

  </math>
 </inline-formula> and 
 <italic>R</italic> points on the surface Brillouin zone. Isostructural compounds of CoGe, RhGe, and RhSn are also semimetallic and demonstrated elongated surface Fermi arcs, but their form is more complex because of the contribution of background density of states around the Fermi level.
