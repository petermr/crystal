<p>Significant loss of crystallinity is observed, especially for the sample oxidized for longer time. An increase of the amorphous content from about 25% wt in the pristine sample to 50% wt after oxidation was estimated from Rietveld refinement of the XRD data, by using an internal standard of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> quartz (see Figures S3 and S4 in the

 <sup>–1</sup>, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 2.285 Å] is clearly detected after the oxidation (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>D and 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), together with an increase in the intensity of the 001 reflection (003 in

 <sup>–1</sup>, which is assigned to CaF
 <sub>2</sub> derived from BF
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>–</sup> decomposition side reactions. The patterns corresponding to the chemically oxidized sample exhibit main peaks at values of sin(θ)/λ of 0.087, 0.188, 0.195, and 0.219 Å
 <sup>–1</sup> and can be fitted using a structural model with space group 
 <italic>R</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic>, with refined cell parameters 
 <italic>a</italic> = 3.1103(1) and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 17.287(1) Å (see

 </xref> and

 </xref>). The stabilization of 
 <italic>R</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic> structure in the chemically oxidized sample is consistent with the disappearance of the ordered vacancy-Ca configuration in the interlayer space, a feature well described in layered-LiMO
 <sub>2</sub> materials where the lithium content drives the stabilization of particular Li-vacancy orderings and subsequent crystal symmetry changes.

 </sup> The changes in the cell parameters are similar to those observed in α-NaFeO
 <sub>2</sub> and NaVO
 <sub>2</sub> during sodium deintercalation,

 <sub>2</sub>. Expanded 
 <italic>c</italic> axis (as mentioned, interlayer distance in Ca
 <sub>0.89</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub>, 5.658 Å would correspond to a hexagonal 
 <italic>c</italic> axis of 16.974 Å) resulting from increasing coulombic repulsions as the amount of ions in the interslab space decreases. The refined calcium occupancy for the chemically oxidized sample is 0.34(2), which agrees with the Ca/Ta ratio of 0.4 obtained from XESD analysis. The poor crystallinity of the electrochemically oxidized sample prevents reliable refinement of the Ca occupancy. Nonetheless, the pattern is quite similar to the one of the chemically oxidized sample with 
 <italic>R</italic>3̅
 <italic>m</italic> symmetry and cell parameters 
 <italic>a</italic> = 3.107(1) and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 17.363(5) Å, indicating a slightly larger expansion along 
 <italic>c</italic>. The X-ray diffraction patterns of samples obtained by reduction of oxidized Ca
 <sub>0.89</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> did not show any additional change, which is a clear indication that calcium deintercalation is an irreversible process. Interestingly, very similar behavior has been reported for NaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> which was also oxidized chemically (in that case using NO
 <sub>2</sub>PF
 <sub>6</sub>) with significant amorphization and decrease in the relative intensity of some peaks with respect to others. In that case, no Rietveld refinement was possible even for pristine NaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>, despite a hexagonal cell being suggested and hence no values for sodium occupancy were available either. Yet, the 
 <italic>c</italic> contraction together with a gradual loss of crystallinity upon progressive oxidation was clearly established. Moreover, all attempts to reintroduce sodium in the structure were also unsuccessful. As for NaTaN
 <sub>2</sub>, tantalum is in its highest oxidation state, the authors do speculate that the redox reaction may involve nitrogen as well, despite not being able to confirm this hypothesis. The elemental analysis of the Ca
 <sub>0.89</sub>TaN
 <sub>2</sub> sample after chemical oxidation revealed a nitrogen content of 7.7% wt, that is slightly lower than the one determined for the pristine phase (10.5% wt) while distribution of Ca and Ta remains homogeneous (see
