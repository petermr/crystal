 <italic>Q</italic>, for, from the bottom, the initial Al sample in the as-received condition, an Al disk processed by HPT for 5 turns, the Al-Mg system immediately after HPT for 100 turns and Al-Mg processed by HPT for 100 turns followed by natural aging at room temperature for 60 days. From the XRD line profiles, it is possible to reach the following three conclusions.
