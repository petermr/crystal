<p>Single crystal copper is a face-centered cubic lattice, so the distribution density, arrangement and interatomic binding force of the single crystal copper are different for different crystal directions. The lattice orientation of the tip is the same as those of 0° textures. For the orientation of 0° and 90°, the contact atoms between the tip and substrate show commensurability and the average friction forces are higher than the other cases. For orientations of 30°, 45° and 60°, the lattice of the tip mismatches with the lattice of the substrate, which can prevent the simultaneous stick-slip motion of all atoms in the contact, and the friction forces show low values.</p>
