<p id="Par33">The methodology presented here is relevant for identifying (or screening) unknown materials with a targeted combination of topological properties in an efficient manner with high fidelity. Our results highlight the ability of machine learning analyses for unraveling the embedded topological aspects of configuration space when inspecting condensed matter systems.</p>
