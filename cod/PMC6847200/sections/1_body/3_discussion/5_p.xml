<p>Insights into the structural and ligand binding properties of 
 <italic>env1</italic> and other class-II 2′-dG riboswitches potentially provide new avenues for harnessing these RNAs for synthetic biological applications. Synthetic riboswitches derived from natural purine riboswitches have been implemented in diverse bacteria including industrially important strains of cyanobacteria (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and thermophiles (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) to regulate gene expression. Furthermore, it has been shown that the guanine riboswitch can be reprogrammed to recognize pyrimidine (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and pterin (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) compounds with only a limited set of mutations, further diversifying the utility of this riboswitch platform. More recently, it was shown that the purine riboswitch aptamer can be used as an architectural ‘scaffold’ to evolve radically new binding pockets within the three-way junction for compounds dissimilar to purines such as serotonin and dopamine (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The current study suggests how small insertion elements in the purine riboswitch may be leveraged to engineer RNAs responsive to purine-like compounds and proposes potential enhancement of binding affinities by expanding hydrogen-bonding networks in the binding core. As the demand for a diverse set of robust small molecule responsive regulatory systems increases, the purine riboswitch continues to present new opportunities to meet these needs in synthetic biology.
