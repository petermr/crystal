<p>The pattern matching of the air annealed sample (yellow sample) can be achieved without any difficulties using the P2
 <sub>1</sub>/n space group. The matching quality is good, and the reliability factors below 10%: Rexp = 3.01%; Rf = 8.55%; Rp = 6.47%. In opposition, the refinement of the raw powder firstly performed considering that a single cubic structure leads to a low matching quality with relatively high reliability factors: Rexp = 1.49%; Rf = 17%; Rp = 13.5%. The subtraction of the simulated signal to the experimental indicates that a “back-asymmetry” of the experimental diffraction peaks is observed, which cannot originate from the condition of the X-ray pattern acquisition (in opposition with “front-asymmetry”, which typically originates from the approximation made during the projection of the intercept of diffraction cones on the 2θ diffraction angle linear axis). Back-asymmetry cannot be issued from geometric consideration on the experimental measurement collection (on the contrary to front-asymmetry, which is caused by the 2D projection of the arc of the diffraction cone in Bragg-Bentano geometry). To take into account this back-asymmetry, one has to consider a distribution of the unit-cell parameters, i.e., to fit the experimental diffractogramms, a set of different unit-cell must be integrated to the calculation. For illustration, three lattice parameters instead of a single one are used herein. The result of this latter fitting is closer to the XRD experimental pattern, leading to a significant decrease of the various reliability factors: Rexp = 1.49%; Rf = 8.72%; Rp = 6.59%. The diffraction peaks width of the blue and the black samples is characteristic of low dimension crystallites. Thus, the raw powder seems to have a lattice parameter gradient. This can be explained considering two different hypothesis:
