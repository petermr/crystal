 <caption> ( a) Temporal evolution of an ensemble of randomly oriented tetrakis-μ-pyrophosphitodiplatinate (II) (PtPOP) molecules before ( τ &lt; 0 ) and after ( τ ≥ 0 ) excitation. Only the molecules with the transition dipole moment (along the Pt-Pt axis) parallel to the laser field E are excited at τ = 0 ; ( b) Scheme of the optical pump X-ray probe experiment at LCLS. On the detector, the difference diffraction pattern averaged over N ≈ 3000 shots is shown; ( c) Temporal decay with the time constant 46 ± 10 ps of the value S 2 ( τ ) , which is normalized area under the peak at q = 1.8   Å − 1 of the second Fourier component of the CCF 〈 C 2 ( q , τ ) 〉 . The faster decay of S 2 ( τ ) with the time constant 1.9 ± 1.5 ps is shown in inset (adapted from [ 58]). Used under CC-BY 4.0. </caption>
