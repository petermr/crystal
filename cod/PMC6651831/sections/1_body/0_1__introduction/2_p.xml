<p>The transverse thermoelectric composite can further be categorized into layered and fibrous thermoelectric composites. These two types of composites can also be seen as two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) inclusion composites. For layered composites with isotropic components, Babin et al. [

 <sub>trans</sub>T), while other researchers performed finite element simulations and experimental tests and validated such a mathematical model [
