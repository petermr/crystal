 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f005">Figure 5</xref>a illustrates the positions of crystallographic axes in the HRTEM pattern. Red dots correspond to the two extra atomic rows. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f005">Figure 5</xref>b schematically represents the dislocation region, including the position of the two edge dislocations generated by extra atomic planes. Deformation analysis of elementary cells relies on the idealization of a 3-D atomic array formed by superposing identical 2-D atomic arrays stacked in the vertical direction. Since this stack may change over depth because of the sequence shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f001">Figure 1</xref> based in the covalent bonding of Si and C atoms, the present analysis is limited to the 2-D array.
