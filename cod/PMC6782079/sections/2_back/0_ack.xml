Antao for providing the garnet samples and the synchrotron refinement for those samples for resolution comparison. Special thanks go to Dr Robert B. Von Dreele and Dr Brian H. Toby for all their efforts in developing

A project like this is not possible without contributions from many people, and the authors would like to acknowledge the guidance of Dr Ken Herwig in project management, Dr Andrew Payzant, Dr Cheng Li and Dr Jue Liu for useful discussions, Genevieve Martin for assistance with graphics, and all other construction and support groups for making this a successful upgrade project.
