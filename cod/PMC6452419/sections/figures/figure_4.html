 <caption> 3D illustration and its schematic 2D analogue of DORI [ f] domains for a given Câ€“C bond (a) of BCA at ambient pressure with f = 0.9990 (b), f = 0.9984 (c), f = 0.9980 (d), f = 0.9978 (e), f = 0.9966 (f), and f = 0.9940 (g). The gray lines represent DORI isocontours for each step. For each step, the grid points (in black) with DORI values higher than f are shown in blue. Red encircled grid points correspond to the basin merging points (e.g., three basins merged in two points in panels d and f). </caption>
