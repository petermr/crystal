<p>Traditional time-of-flight (TOF) diffractometers use detector ‘banks’ at a few selected angles along with a broad wavelength range to produce a limited number of data sets of intensity versus wavelength at these few scattering angles. The angular range of these ‘banks’ is selected so that the peak widths from the combined scattering angles are the same, resulting in constant resolution data sets, albeit with limited 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing or elastic momentum transfer 
 <italic>Q</italic> (= 2π/
 <italic>d</italic>) range. In contrast, a constant wavelength (CW) diffractometer at a reactor source can access longer 
 <italic>d</italic> spacings and relatively low 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> with a variable resolution (δ
 <italic>d</italic>/
 <italic>d</italic>). The third-generation concept of a TOF diffractometer was proposed at the 14th Meeting of the International Collaboration on Advanced Neutron Sources by Radaelli (1998
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb32"> ▸</xref>). This concept maximizes the short bandwidth resulting from the 60 Hz operation at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and an uninterrupted angular coverage afforded by a continuous detector locus to collect a single data set of intensity versus angle and time of flight. By design, POWGEN is a diffractometer that bridges the gap between traditional TOF and CW diffractometers, offering access to high 
 <italic>Q</italic>, variable resolution as a function of 
 <italic>d</italic> spacing and access to large 
 <italic>d</italic> spacing by changing the wavelength band of operation.
