<p>In the mechanism of the influence of ions on the hydration characteristics in montmorillonite interlayers, most researchers believe that montmorillonite has high swelling capacity and hydrophilicity when montmorillonite layers contain cations with strong hydration ability (such as Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Li
 <sup>+</sup>) [

 <sup>+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup>, and K
 <sup>+</sup>) in the process of montmorillonite hydration, and found that with the increasing of the montmorillonite interlayer water content, Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Li
 <sup>+</sup> were easy to separate from the interlayer of montmorillonite, while K
 <sup>+</sup> would move and be bound to the silicon oxygen tetrahedron surface [

 <sup>+</sup> and Cs
 <sup>+</sup>), montmorillonite had weak expansion ability and poor hydrophilicity, and easily was affected by various factors such as temperature and pressure [
