<p>Starting from the reports, the geometry optimization of GeSe in the 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> phase under zero hydrostatic pressure was carried out. The equilibrium structural parameters, including the lattice constants and the atomic coordinates, were obtained without the pressure effect. The optimized crystallographic data of 
 <italic>Pnma</italic> GeSe under zero pressure are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03612-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
