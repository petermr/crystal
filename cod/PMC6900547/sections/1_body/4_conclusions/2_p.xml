<p>Both the experiments and computation simulations indicate that the ions with the most dominant effect on zabuyelite growth will be Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, and SO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2â€“</sup>. Particularly, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> will limit Li-carbonate growth through the competitive precipitation of Mg-carbonate phases, and thus removal of carbonate activity, which lowers the system supersaturation with respect to the Li-carbonate phase. In the industrial processes, this is alleviated by removing the Mg from the brine solution at the initial stages of Li extraction (see Meshram for a review
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
 </sup>). However, this study demonstrates that even brines with low Mg may significantly limit the extraction of Li. The morphological evidence of the calcite crystals from our experiments at 0.33 M CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> indicates that the presence of significant amounts of Li can actually inhibit calcite formation from solution. Therefore, less Ca will need to be extracted to effectively precipitate Li-carbonate. However, there is evidence that a small amount of Ca can be incorporated into the zabuyelite phase produced in the 0.033 M CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> experiments. Thus, the zabuyelite produced may have a lower purity in the presence of Ca. This may also occur when sulfate is present as there is also an increase in the FWHM of the carbonate symmetrical stretch in the Raman spectra of zabuyelite formed in these experiments.
