<p>Notably, the first, second and third peaks can be clearly seen from the RDF curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f003">Figure 3</xref>. This figure refers to the coordinates of a given particle, with the probability of distribution of other particles in space; the sharp peaks represent order, and the round peaks represent disorder. The first, second, and third peaks represent the first three positions in which the particle has the highest probability of occurrence from the specified atom.
