<p id="Par2">Metallic glasses (MGs) are metal alloys that lack long-range order or periodicity. They often possess some exceptional characteristics that are unattainable from crystalline alloys, such as outstanding mechanical properties

And at the same time, because of the limited ability for the alloy to form amorphous structure, only a thin amorphous strip of limited compositions can be prepared. Attempts have been made to develop alternative methods to form amorphous alloys. In the 1980s, a new category of amorphization techniques based on solid-state reactions was developed, such as mechanical alloying
