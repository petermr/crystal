 </sup> The generalized gradient approximation, developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>
 </sup> was employed to account for electron exchange–correlation effects. The energy cutoff for plane waves, included in the expansion of wave functions, was set to 500 eV, and a 9 × 9 × 9 Monkhorst–Pack 
 <italic>k</italic>-point mesh
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>
 </sup> was chosen for the Brillouin zone integration. The calculated total energies were converged within an accuracy of 1 meV/atom with respect to both the energy cutoff and the number of 
 <italic>k</italic>-points. During structural optimizations, all atomic coordinates, volume, and cell shape of the considered phases were allowed to be relaxed. To derive the total electronic density of states (DOS), the tetrahedron method for the Brillouin zone integration was employed.
