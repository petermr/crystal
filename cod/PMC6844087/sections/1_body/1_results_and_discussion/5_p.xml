<p>Even though this first analysis seems to clearly show that the phases are formed, all of the samples have been analyzed by the Rietveld refinement
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
 </sup> to extract quantitative information about their chemical composition. In 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>, the result of the refinement for one of the samples is shown.
