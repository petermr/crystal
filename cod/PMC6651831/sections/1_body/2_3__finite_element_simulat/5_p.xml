<p>Finite element models with tilted aligned fibers in a matrix were also constructed to study the cooling capacity of the composite. The properties of polycrystal Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> and Copper were applied. The fiber rotation angle was fixed at 80 degrees. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the composite can be seen as fiber arrays periodically aligned in the x-direction. Therefore, to simplify the finite element model, only one fiber array was constructed inside the matrix block, and periodic boundary conditions were applied on the surfaces parallel to the y-z plane. The geometry of the model was 2 mm × 500 mm × 10 mm, while the fiber diameter was adjusted to suit different fiber volume fractions. The bottom surface of the device was fixed at 300 K to serve as a heat sink, while the top surface was subjected to natural convective heat transfer. Two 1 mm thick Copper blocks were added on both ends of the y-direction of the composite to serve as electrodes. Twenty cases were studied with different fiber volume fractions, fiber shapes, and with respect to the two configurations mentioned above. Within each case, the input electrical current density was adjusted until the maximum temperature difference between the top and bottom surface was reached.
