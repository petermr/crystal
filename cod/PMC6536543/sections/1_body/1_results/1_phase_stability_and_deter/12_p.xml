<p id="Par17">The evolution of the DFT-calculated polyhedral unit volumes with compression is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The compression of the unit cell is dominated by the compression of the softer calcium-centered polyhedral units. In the case of the low-pressure tilleyite phase, two types of polyhedra have a lower bulk modulus than the unit cell, a seven-fold [CaO
 <sub>7</sub>] capped-octahedron and the [CaO
 <sub>6</sub>] octahedron, with B
 <sub>0(P1)</sub> = 54.6(9) and B
 <sub>0(P2)</sub> = 66.2(6) GPa, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> of SI). After the transition, the remaining [CaO
 <sub>6</sub>] octahedron exhibits a similar bulk modulus B
 <sub>0(P3)</sub> = 89.0(9) GPa to that of the unit cell, but two other polyhedral units are more compressible under compression: an 8-fold and the 9-fold coordinated Ca units with 62.7(3) and 83(1) GPa, respectively. Note that the diversity of environments of the Ca atoms is not only defined by the number of oxygen neighbours but also by the range of compressibilities of the different [CaO
 <sub>n</sub>] polyhedra, with bulk moduli as high as 139 (3) GPa.
