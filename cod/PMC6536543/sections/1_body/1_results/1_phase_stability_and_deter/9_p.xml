<p id="Par14">Interestingly, between 8–9 GPa there is an abrupt splitting of the Si-O band and an even more remarkable one of the C-O bands, which perfectly agree with XRD results of the tilleyite to post-tilleyite transition. The orientational change of the [CO
 <sub>3</sub>] groups explains the splitting of the C-O stretching as its environment has changed. The splitting of the Si-O stretching into two contributions is perfectly explained by the existence of two types of unequivalent disilicate groups [Si
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>] in post-tilleyite while in tilleyite there was only one. In the bending mode regions between 600 and 800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, the Si-O bending splits into several contributions and some of them blueshift as a consequence of the observed decrease in the Si-O-Si bond angle

 </sup>. On the other hand, the prints from the lattice modes drastically change as there appears an intense band at around 80 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The splitting of all the contributions at the phase transition is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> of the SI. Moreover, there is a change in the O-H stretching region at the transition as a new contribution appears at around 3000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The presence of O-H stretching and bending bands provides evidence for the existence of [SiO
 <sub>3</sub>(OH)] groups in both, the low- and high-pressure phases. In addition to that aforementioned, the spectroscopic results presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show a significant band broadening between 19 and 25 GPa, which is a consequence of the abrupt increase of deviatoric stresses in the sample due to the fact that argon is highly non-hydrostatic above that pressure. Pressure-induced amorphization is ruled out because post-tilleyite and tilleyite spectra were observed on pressure release.
