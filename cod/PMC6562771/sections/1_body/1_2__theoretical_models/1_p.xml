<p>In this work, three categories of models, i.e., surface profile model in response to one tool feed, surface topography model in the radial direction and 3D surface topography model, will be discussed. The influencing factors and corresponding issues in the modeling process are therefore summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00288-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The order for these models in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00288-f001">Figure 1</xref> is also consistent with the calculation process of surface topography in diamond turning process.
