<p>Take the shocked ε-CL-20 crystal as an example. The N–NO
 <sub>2</sub> bonds with the exo-spatial orientation with respect to the five-membered imidazolidine ring were the trigger bonds. During the shock process, the molecular conformations at different times are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. Both the increase of the trigger bond length and the decrease of the trigger bond strength went in an exponential manner, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01251-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c. When the stretching of the chemical bond reached the cutoff percentage relative to the equilibrium state, we defined it as broken. Therefore, the first breaking of the trigger bond of the shocked ε-CL-20 crystal occurred at
