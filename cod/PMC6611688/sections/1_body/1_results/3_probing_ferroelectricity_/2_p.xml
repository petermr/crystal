<p>To demonstrate switching of the ferroelectric polarization of WTe
 <sub>2</sub>, spectroscopic PFM measurements were performed through the top electrode in a capacitor geometry, which has been successfully used before for subelectrode PFM measurements (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>) shows switchable hysteretic behavior consistent with that seen in traditional ferroelectrics such as BaTiO
 <sub>3</sub> and Pb(Zr
 <sub>x</sub>Ti
 <sub>1-x</sub>)O
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>32</italic>
 </xref>). The PFM amplitude response displays a characteristic “butterfly” curve, while the corresponding phase response exhibits a phase inversion (i.e., a phase change of approximately 180°) at minima of the amplitude response. To directly visualize these switchable polarization states, we applied switching bias pulses with the subsequent acquisition of PFM images to capture the remnant state. The bias-driven, oppositely oriented remnant polarization can be clearly seen in the PFM images of different color contrasts (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E to G</xref>). The initial near-uniform bright contrast of the phase image transforms to a predominant dark phase contrast. This bias-induced transformation between antiparallel equivalent polarization states of the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> can be accomplished repeatedly and in a reversible fashion by inverting the polarity of the applied writing bias (fig. S4). These measurements therefore demonstrate that the polarization of WTe
 <sub>2</sub> is switchable under an external bias.
