<p>It is instructive to examine the structural variation within each phase in two different ways. First, we can simply plot the relative change of each lattice parameter on applying pressure (

 <italic>a</italic>,
 <italic>b</italic>). In both the orthorhombic and the rhombohedral phases, the linear compressibility varies substantially between the crystallographic axes (
 <xref rid="RSTA20180227TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). At the most extreme example, in the orthorhombic phase of 
 <bold>MnGF</bold>, the linear compressibility along the 
 <italic>a</italic>-axis is substantial while that along the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis is within experimental error of zero. This behaviour is readily understandable in terms of the orientation of the guanidinium ions. These ions act as struts, keeping the framework relatively rigid within their plane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20180227F1">figure 1</xref>) while preserving void space above and below this plane, allowing compression in the perpendicular direction. In the orthorhombic phase, the 
 <italic>c</italic>-axis runs parallel to the plane of every guanidinium ion, while the 
 <italic>a</italic>- and 
 <italic>b</italic>-axes are angled away from these planes; thus the linear compressibility is far greater along the 
 <italic>a</italic>- or 
 <italic>b</italic>-axes than along 
 <italic>c</italic>. By contrast, in the rhombohedral phase, the guanidinium ions lie in the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane, and the linear compressibility is hence greater along 
 <italic>c</italic> than along 
 <italic>a</italic> or 
 <italic>b</italic>. The net effect in both materials is that the two phases have comparable bulk moduli (
