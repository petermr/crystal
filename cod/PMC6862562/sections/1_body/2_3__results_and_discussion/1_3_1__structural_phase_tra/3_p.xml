<p>The pressure dependence of the lattice parameters, cell volume, bond length, and bond angle may provide useful information regarding the original phase transition. To investigate further details of the effects of pressure, the reduced crystal parameters including lattice constants and cell volume as a function of hydrostatic pressure are plotted, as shown in
