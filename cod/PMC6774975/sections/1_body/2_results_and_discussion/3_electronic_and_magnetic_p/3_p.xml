<p>It is known that Fe-based ternary Heusler compounds often exhibit magnetism, which is very important for the application in spintronics and magnetoelectronics. So, we move on to examine the magnetic properties of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in different structures, and the calculated total and atom-resolved magnetic moments at equilibrium lattice are listed in 
 <xref rid="RSOS191007TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. The total magnetic moment is mainly contributed by the transition metal elements Fe and Ni, and also they are ferromagnetically aligned because of the same positive sign. It can also be found that the different atom site ordering leads to a larger variation in both total and atom-resolved magnetic moments.
