<p>Once prepared, the sample was transferred under vacuum using a custom-built vacuum suitcase and UHV baby chamber combination (base pressure ∼1.5 × 10
 <sup>–9</sup> mbar) incorporating a dome-shaped X-ray-transparent beryllium window suitable for the collection of SXRD data. The chamber was mounted to I07’s diffractometer, where data were collected using a 2D Pilatus photon detector. Measurements were carried out at room temperature with an incidence angle of 1° and a photon energy of 17.7 keV (=0.7 Å). The sample was mounted such that the surface was in the horizontal plane. A systematic series of X-ray reflections were acquired in a stationary geometry (

A reference reflection, (−1, 0, 0.97), was recorded for both the clean and water covered surfaces at regular intervals to monitor surface degradation. No significant changes were observed throughout the duration of the experiment.
