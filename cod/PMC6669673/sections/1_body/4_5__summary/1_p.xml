<p>In summary, DIA was developed to calculate the free energy (or PF) of 2D materials on a substrate, and the high calculation precision was validated by MD simulations. It should be pointed out that such a test is much more stringent than the comparisons between the results derived from the PF and experiments because the same interaction potential is used in both calculations of the PF and the MD simulations, while the potential may not correctly describe the realistic interactions between atoms concerned in the experiment. As for the efficiency, DIA works at least four orders of magnitude faster than the most efficient method, ANS, developed previously, and enables calculations of the free energy based on ab initio calculations to predict the optimal conditions for novel 2D materialsâ€™ growth on a substrate, which would greatly shorten the way to experimental realization.</p>
