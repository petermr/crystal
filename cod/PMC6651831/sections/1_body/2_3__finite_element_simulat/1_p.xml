<p>In order to validate the effectiveness of the mathematical model, finite element simulations were carried out using COMSOL (COMSOL Multiphysics, COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA, USA). A unit cell model based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02049-f001">Figure 1</xref>c was constructed using polycrystal Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> as the matrix phase and Copper as the fiber phase assuming the isotropy plane of Bi
 <sub>2</sub>Te
 <sub>3</sub> was perpendicular to the fiber axis. For all finite element models involved in this study, mesh convergence studies were carried out and the convergence error was limited to below 3%.
