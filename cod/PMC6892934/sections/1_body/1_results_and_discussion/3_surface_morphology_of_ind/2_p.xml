<p id="Par20">Observations of maximum and minimum pile-up in the &lt;110&gt; and &lt;100&gt; directions respectively, can be explained by considering the &lt;111&gt; slip directions in bcc tungsten. Dislocations gliding along any of the four &lt;111&gt; directions can exit where these directions intersect the sample surface (which here has [001] normal). As such, the pile-up on the [001] plane, is expected to occur preferentially along the projection of the &lt;111&gt; directions on the [001] plane i.e. along the four &lt;110&gt; directions lying in the [001] plane which are at 90° to each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Little pile-up is expected to occur along the &lt;100&gt; directions that lie in the [001] plane. We note in passing that CPFE correctly predicts the experimentally observed four-fold pile-up pattern, by constraining slip to the applicable crystallographic slip systems. The contrasting, unphysical uniform distribution of pile-up around the indent, predicted by an isotropic continuum finite element (FEM) model, is displayed in Figure B.1 (Appendix B in Supplementary Material) for comparison.
