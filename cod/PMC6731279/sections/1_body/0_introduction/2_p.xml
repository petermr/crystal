  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. Unfortunately, EGs formed by this way are extremely fragile to oxidation environment

 <sub>3</sub>/STO because their EGs quickly vanish after annealing in oxygen at moderate temperatures, i.e. 300 °C or lower
