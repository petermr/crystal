 <caption> Molecular conformation and packing in the computed structures of form II. Overlay of structures P2 1/ c (black) and Pc (the two different molecular conformations are coded in color). The Pc structures in the two drawings (left and right) differ in the sign of the perturbation applied to the initial P2 1/ c structure, but are actually identical except for a shift of the origin. Their average corresponds to the P2 1/ c structure. </caption>
