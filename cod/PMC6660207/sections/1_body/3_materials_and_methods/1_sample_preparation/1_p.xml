<p>Bulk crystals of (PEA)
 <sub>2</sub>PbI
 <sub>4</sub> were synthesized by supersaturation precipitation method. Stoichiometric moles of three precursors: C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>NH
 <sub>2</sub>, HI, and PbI
 <sub>2</sub> were added in a round flask in γ-butyrolactone solvent until the solution became saturated. During the addition, the mixture was vigorously stirred by a magnetic stirrer in a hot oil bath to maintain clear yellow solution. After that, the round flask was allowed to evaporate slowly at 70°C in a vented oven for several days. After 3 to 7 days, orange and laminar crystals with millimeter size were collected and dried in vacuum at room temperature. After synthesis, the as-grown crystal flakes were mechanically exfoliated using scotch tape until the size and thickness matched the chamber size of the DAC. Then, the crystal microplates were transferred into the DAC using a sharp tungsten probe under stereoscopic microscope.
