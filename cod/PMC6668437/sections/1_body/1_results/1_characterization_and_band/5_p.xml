<p id="Par10">The next step is to include the Mn 
 <italic>d</italic> magnetism and spin–orbit coupling to the computational scheme. As a first approximation, we consider the ordering of Mn moments as perfectly antiferromagnetic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and neglect the contributions of the 4
 <italic>f</italic> states of rare earth ions which are still treated as non-spin-polarized quasi-core states. The results of the fully relativistic band-structure calculations are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. Three bands contribute to the formation of the Fermi surface (FS), 2D cross-sections of which are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. Green and blue dispersions correspond mostly to Mn states while the red one represents discussed above Bi 
 <italic>p</italic>-states. As is seen, spin–orbit and exchange interactions make the Dirac electronic states “massive” in both materials, i.e., opens the gaps in most parts of the BZ. Again, there are important differences. While the gap is equally large (~0.2 eV) across the BZ in EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> creating isolated “lenses” of FS, the gap in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> is smaller (down to ~10 meV along the ΓM line), adding to the “lenses” small electron-like pockets near the X-points. The distinct separation of these two portions of the FS signals the opening of the gap also in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> and, in particular, breaking of the nodal loop (green contour in upper BZ sketch in Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but above E
 <sub>F</sub> one crossing is preserved as is seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> where the red and blue dispersions touch each other along ΓM direction. We have found in total four 3D-Dirac points in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> with the coordinates (±0.193, ±0.193, 0.015) and (±0.193, ±0.193, −0.015), which are schematically shown in lower BZ sketch in Fig.
