 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>g) spectra show a blue shift after the CE reaction, indicating a widening of the band gap. This can be attributed to either an increase in quantum confinement due to a smaller effective CIS core size,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
 </sup> in case a CIS/CIGS core/shell NC is formed, or by the intrinsic increase in band gap,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>
 </sup> in case a homogeneous CIGS alloy is formed, as the band gap of bulk CuGaS
 <sub>2</sub> is larger than that of CuInS
 <sub>2</sub> (2.50 and 1.55 eV, respectively).

 </sup> Our results, however, do not allow a distinction between the two cases to be made. The PL quantum yield (QY) of the product CIGS NCs increases by 1 order of magnitude in comparison to that of the parent CIS NCs (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>g). Such an increase in PLQY could originate from a strong enhancement of the radiative recombination rates, from elimination of nonradiative recombination pathways, or from a combination of both. Considering that similar PLQY enhancements have been previously observed upon shelling of CIS NCs with both ZnS and CdS, and attributed to passivation of nonradiative recombination centers at the surface,

 </sup> it is likely that the higher PLQY of the CIGS NCs obtained by cation exchange is also due to improved surface passivation. It is interesting to note that PL of CIGS NCs is generally not reported,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>

 <sub>2</sub> NCs, the PL in these nanomaterials most likely originates from the radiative recombination of a delocalized conduction band electron with a hole localized at a Cu(I) ion.
 <sup>

 </sup> Time-resolved spectroscopic measurements could provide additional insights into the origin of the radiative recombination in these nanomaterials but are beyond the scope of the present work. It should be noted that the PL of these Pb- and Cd-free NCs is centered in the NIR biological window.

 </sup> This, in combination with their high PLQY, makes them promising candidates for bioimaging applications. Most importantly, the results discussed above show that the CE mechanism proposed in the present work is widely applicable.
