<p>Turning lastly to the spectrum of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, one notes first the sharp Raman lines because of its well-ordered crystalline structure. Of the 93 optical modes of β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, 48 are Raman-active. About 30 are clearly visible in the spectrum shown in 
 <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>
 </xref>. Their DFT calculated wavenumbers are included in this figure. Above 1000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> modes are associated with B–B exo-bonds, which are between B4 atoms (cf. 
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>
 </xref>). The B–B exo-bond length in β-SiB
 <sub>3</sub> is reduced with respect to α-SiB
 <sub>3</sub>, but similar to that of B
 <sub>6</sub>P. At lower wavenumbers, one first notes two groups of bands, which are located between 600 and 750 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> and 870 and 950 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. The former correspond predominately to icosahedron (skeleton) modes, whereas the latter relate to Si–B exo-bonds. Modes below 500 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are then associated with Si–Si vibrations within the zigzag chain structure of Si
 <sub>4</sub> rhomboid rings (cf. 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>). The mode at 474 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> corresponds to the stretch between two Si1 atoms, which connect rhomboid ring units. This Si–Si bond length (2.33 Å) is similar to that of elemental Si (2.35 Å) and, thus, considerably shorter than the distance between Si atoms forming dumbbells in α-SiB
 <sub>3–
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>. The intense band at 184 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is associated with the breathing mode of a Si
 <sub>4</sub> rhomboid unit.
