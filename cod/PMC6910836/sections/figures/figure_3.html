 <caption> Direct spectroscopic observations of Sn oxide SNCs on Au@Ag SHINs. ( A) SHINER spectra of Sn oxide SNCs deposited on Au@Ag SHINs on Si substrates, compared with a reference spectrum obtained without SnCl 2 as a blank. A sharp signal from the silicon substrate is indicated by an asterisk. ( B) A schematic diagram of the process used to prepare samples for SHINERS analysis of Sn oxide SNCs. Effects of atomicity on ( C) the peak position and ( D) FWHM values. </caption>
