<p>Childs et al. once studied the dependence of peak-valley surface roughness on the feed rate per revolution with a rounded cutting tool, and reported that under a smaller feed, the tool feature that controls the final surface finish changes from nose radius to cutting edge radius [

 <xref rid="B33-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Hence, in addition to the duplication effect to tool edge profile, the influence of cutting edge radius (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>n</sub>) should also be taken into account particularly when the feed rate is small enough. Specifically, the influence of cutting edge radius on the surface topography formation is via the existence of the minimum undeformed chip thickness in diamond turning. The theoretical analyses [

 <xref rid="B35-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], molecular dynamic (MD) simulation [
 <xref rid="B36-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] as well as the experimental observations [
 <xref rid="B37-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] all reported that there is a linear relationship between the minimum undeformed chip thickness (
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>Dmin</sub>) and the tool cutting edge radius (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>n</sub>), i.e., 
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>Dmin</sub> = 
 <italic>kr</italic>
 <sub>n</sub>, where 
 <italic>k</italic> is the corresponding linear coefficient. Further investigations [
 <xref rid="B34-micromachines-10-00288" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] disclosed that the coefficient 
 <italic>k</italic> is in relation to the contact behavior between the diamond tool and workpiece surface, especially the mechanical properties of the work material and the frictional coefficient on the tool-workpiece contact interface.
