<p>Therefore, it is recommended to do more studies on applying the technology of piezoelectric materials with different piezoelectric transducers or by trying other aligning ways with large applying areas to utilize noise on vast application areas and in different locations with high traffic density such as city centers, city nodes and other main traffic roads; as noise considered a fast growing environmental problem and creates a great source of clean energy as well. In addition to increasing the production of the piezoelectric material to lower its cost as it form a great approach of producing clean energy.</p>
