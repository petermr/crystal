 <title>Significance</title>
 <p>Gas clathrates in which water cages enclose the guest gas molecules naturally form on our planet, for instance on ocean floors. Related methane hydrates are also expected to be present under very high pressures (10 to 200 GPa) in giant planetary interiors such as Uranus or Neptune. However, the stability of such structures at these pressures is currently debated. Joint Raman spectroscopy and ab initio simulations show the stability of a high-pressure methane hydrate phase up to at least 150 GPa, the highest pressure explored to date for such compounds. The structure of this phase and the complex transition mechanism from the known MH-III phase are detailed and shown to be in accordance with all known experimental observations.</p>
