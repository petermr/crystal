<p>Of all the COFs we considered, 12 COFs are nonporous for CO
 <sub>2</sub> or N
 <sub>2</sub> (according to the atomic radii definition from UFF, i.e., half of the Lennard-Jones sigma) and need to be excluded from the calculation. In addition, eight structures have inaccessible pores, which need to be blocked to prevent GCMC from growing particles in these narrow pockets. In the present study, we assumed that the COFs are rigid and therefore maintain their stacking upon adsorption. One can envision changes in the stacking upon adsorption. It would be prohibitively expensive to include framework flexibility in our screening structures, but it would be important to study these effects if one further considers top performing structures.
