 <sub>C</sub> value is 791(15) °C at 65 m depth and towards the top of the flow the closure temperatures drop to values of 734 (19) °C and 764 (20) °C. In particular, the closure temperature of 791 °C (top of the pyroxenite unit) indicates a relative fast cooling rate with respect to all the other measured temperatures suggesting that, at the time of its eruption, no material was present above the pyroxenite and it was cooled down at the contact with the atmosphere (subaerial, submarine environment). Therefore, this evidence coupled with the observed thermal gradients and measured closure temperatures seems to point towards a multiple-eruption scenario rather than to support the hypothesis

 <italic>in-situ</italic>. In this new scenario the different composition of the lithologic units could be therefore be simply ascribed to an initial differentiation process in the magma chamber prior to eruption.
