 </sup> as they are currently being used in a wide range of applications, such as motor engines, heat exchangers, power plants, and air-/spacecraft technology. However, accurate control of the distribution and orientation of the nanoparticles within the matrix material is often limited or even impossible. Detailed knowledge on the alignment of nanostructures through self-assembly is very well-studied in organic systems
