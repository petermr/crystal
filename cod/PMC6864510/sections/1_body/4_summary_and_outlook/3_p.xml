<p>Quasi‐2D perovskites have larger exciton binding energy, which is more conducive to radiative recombination. The EQE of LEDs based on quasi‐2D perovskites has reached 20.1% in near‐infrared emission, 15.5% in green light emission, and 6.2% in blue light emission. In order to achieve higher EQE and more stable LEDs, a few immediate issues need to be addressed. 1) The phase impurity and low‐temperature solution method for quasi‐2D perovskites often increase the defect density. So, the precise regulation of components and improvement of film quality are needed. 2) The poor transportation of charges in the organic amine spacing layers and the charge trapping in a surface trap limit the charge injection and reduce EQE. 3) The equilibrium between mobility and exciton binding energy should be further optimized for effective LEDs. Therefore, the design of heterostructures and efficient charge transfer channels are worth studying for quasi‐2D perovskites.</p>
