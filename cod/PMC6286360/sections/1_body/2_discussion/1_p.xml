<p id="Par12">We have reported the design and synthesis of an AIEgen-based 3D COF, 3D-TPE-COF, starting from tetrahedral and quadrilateral building blocks connected through [4 + 4] imine condensation reactions. The obtained 3D-TPE-COF was characterized by several techniques, and according to cRED analyses, it is identified to adopt a seven-fold interpenetrated 
 <bold>pts</bold> topology with 
 <italic>P</italic>2/
 <italic>c</italic> space group. Interestingly, the immobilization of TPE into 3D COF can allow the resulting 3D-TPE-COF emit yellow fluorescence upon excitation. Moreover, by simply coating 3D-TPE-COF onto a commercial blue LED, the COF-based WLED was constructed with the CIE coordinates of (0.30, 0.35), which showed no degradation under continuously driving at ambient condition for 1200 h. The present work demonstrates that fluorescent 3D COFs is feasible to fabricate rare-earth metal-free WLEDs, which will inspire us to facilitate the development of other fluorescent 3D COFs with higher quantum yields. In addition, considering the intrinsic porosity, the accommodation of dye molecules within the pores of fluorescent 3D COFs may also offer another strategy to construct WLEDs. Currently, these studies are undergoing in our lab.
