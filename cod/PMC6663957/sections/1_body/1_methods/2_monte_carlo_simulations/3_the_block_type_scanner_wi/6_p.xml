<p id="Par33">The image quality phantom as described in NEMA NU 4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] consisting of 3.7 MBq of 
 <sup>18</sup>F was simulated for 20 min. The image quality phantom has two parts. One part of 20 mm inner length includes five hot rods of different diameters (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mm) inside a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cylinder. The other part of 30 mm inner length comprises of two cold rods of the same diameter (8.0 mm) inside a hot cylinder. Since the scanner is not long enough to cover the whole phantom, we had to repeat the same simulation with two different axial positions of the phantom so that in each simulation, one part is axially centered in the scanner.
