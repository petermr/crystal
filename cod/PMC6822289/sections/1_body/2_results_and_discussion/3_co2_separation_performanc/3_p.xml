<p>With our DFT-optimized set of CURATED COFs with DDEC charges, we are now in a position to evaluate their performance for CO
 <sub>2</sub> capture and geological storage from a coal-fired power plant. For consistency, we use the same protocol that our group employed in previous studies to evaluate different classes of microporous materials.

 </sup> In this protocol we assume a pressureâ€“temperature swing adsorption process to separate CO
 <sub>2</sub> from a CO
 <sub>2</sub>/N
 <sub>2</sub> mixture and subsequent compression of purified CO
 <sub>2</sub> to 150 bar, the requirement for underground storage. The key parameter to assess the performance of this process is the minimal parasitic energy, i.e., the energy that is required to separate and compress 1 kg of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. However, other key parameters are also important for the evaluation: one should aim for high purity of the final high-CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration gas, and high working capacity of the materials, to achieve the same productivity with less material or with fewer adsorption/desorption cycles.
