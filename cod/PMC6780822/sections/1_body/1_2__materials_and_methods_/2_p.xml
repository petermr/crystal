<p>A conventional bottom emission white OLED display device was used to investigate the effect of the high refractive index nanoparticle scattering layer, as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-f002">Figure 2</xref>. On the glass substrate, the nanoparticle scattering layer, the planarization layer, and the TFT layer were fabricated sequentially. Next, a color filter and an over coat layer were formed to reproduce color images on the OLED display device. On the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode electrode, the white OLED device, comprised of blue, green, and red emitting layers stacked up, were deposited by a thermal evaporation process. The device was finalized with an aluminum cathode and a top glass substrate. The size of the glass substrate was 370 Ã— 470 mm. Additionally, an OLED device without a nanoparticle scattering layer and a planarization layer was also fabricated as a reference device.
