 </xref> demonstrates a picture of synthesized quantum dots irradiated by sun light and green (532 nm) and red (628 nm) light emission excited by ultraviolet light. As shown in

 </xref>a, UV–visible spectra were measured using toluene as the background and then the synthesized quantum dots were diluted in toluene to measure the corresponding absorption spectra.

 </xref>b shows the fluorescence spectra of the synthesized CdSe/ZnS excited at a wavelength of 440 nm, exhibiting that the peak positions of CdSe/ZnS are present at 532 and 628 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 28, respectively, corresponding to green and red emitting light. Note that a plurality of exciton peaks appears in the UV–vis absorption spectrum and the luminescence spectrum shows a single narrow Gaussian PL peak having a FWHM of less than 35 nm. This implies that the synthesized QD is uniform in size and shape, so it can be inferred that the chemical composition of these QDs is also uniform. This result is consistent with TEM results with uniform size and shape.
