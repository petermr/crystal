<p>The cation exchange reactions were performed following the method reported in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) inside a N
 <sub>2</sub>-filled glovebox. The equivalent of 0.2 mmol cation exchange precursor (0.200 mL of InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, 0.100 mL of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, 0.425 mL of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, 0.465 mL of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP, 0.200 mL of GaCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution) was placed in a vial. Toluene was added to make the total reaction volume after addition of the NC dispersion 2.700 mL (added volume: with InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, 2.000 mL; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, 2.100 mL; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, 1.775 mL; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP, 1.735 mL; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 2.000 mL). The mixture of toluene and cation exchange precursor was heated to the reaction temperature (100 °C with InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP and 30 °C with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>) under constant stirring at 400 rpm. Once the desired temperature was reached, 0.500 mL of parent NC dispersion (equivalent to approximately 10 mg of parent particles) was swiftly injected. The reaction was stopped (reaction time: with InCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, overnight; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TOP, overnight; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–TPP, 60 min; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>–DPP, 60 min; with GaCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 300 min) by removing the vial from the heater and quenched by the addition of methanol and butanol as nonsolvents. All samples were washed at least twice prior to analysis, by addition of methanol and butanol as nonsolvent, centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. Finally, the particles were redispersed in toluene.
