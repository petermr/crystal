<p id="Par8">The presented study is just focused on 35 nm thick GMO thin films. This specific choice is based on preliminary XRD data (not shown here) obtained in films with thicknesses from 20 nm up to 150 nm. While for thicknesses up to 35 nm the films are tetragonal, above 35 nm they exhibit an orthorhombic symmetry generally found in both GMO bulk and relaxed thin films. As the latter case does not bring any novelty, we did not include the study of relaxed thin films in this work. From the tetragonal films, we choose the thickest film in order to ensure the required experimental conditions to characterize their macroscopic properties. The obtained results are discussed involving a comparison with previous results in orthorhombic GMO films deposited onto similar substrate.</p>
