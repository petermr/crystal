<p id="Par10">The Debye temperature, Θ
 <sub>D</sub>, is a quantity that is important for thermodynamical and equation-of-state modeling and it can be calculated directly from our phonon density of states. In this case, Θ
 <sub>D</sub> = 161 K that should be compared to Wallace’s analysis (162 K)
