<p>To verify the analysis algorithm for the natural frequencies and mode shapes of DRG proposed in this paper, FEA results are obtained with the commercial modeling tools software COMSOL, which is commonly used for this kind of simulation. The FEA results are compared with the calculation results obtained by MATLAB. The geometry parameters are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Thickness of the structure is set as 150 μm and the anchor radius is set as 1 mm. According to the common geometry parameters in micromachined DRGs, in the comparison, the range of the ring numbers, ring widths, and radius steps were set as 8–16, 2 μm–12 μm, and 40 μm–160 μm, respectively. To simplify the process, the ring widths and radius steps of different layers are set to be identical.
