<p id="P12">As both Ni(OEP) and EMF molecules have inhomogeneous charge distribution, electrostatic interactions may play an important role. This factor can be analyzed qualitatively with the help of electrostatic potential distribution

 </sup> as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. The nitrogen atoms in Ni(OEP) create a rather high negative potential. To achieve optimal electrostatic interactions, an EMF molecule should be oriented towards Ni(OEP) with its highest positive potential sites. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> for YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>, the poles of the cage have a more negative potential as opposed to the Sc- or Y-coordination sites on the equator, where the potential is more positive. The highest relative energies are indeed found for those structures, in which the pole of the EMF faces Ni(OEP) (
