<p>At this point we conclude that, for pulsed excitation sources, Liouville’s theorem is in favor of imaging ToF instruments, owing to their linear columns lacking any slits. The principal advantage of ToF over dispersive energy recording is most apparent when aiming at very large fields-of-view at high energies [leading to huge phase-space volumes, equation (1)
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1"/>]. The same argument holds when aiming at high energy resolution in the few 10 meV range, demanding a very small entrance slit in a hemispherical analyzer. Bandwidths of &lt;20 meV have been reached in several soft X-ray beamlines (
