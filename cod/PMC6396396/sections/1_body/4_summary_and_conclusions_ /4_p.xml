<p>As more powerful algorithms and computers are developing, the number of atoms in the system becomes less relevant for the consideration of DFT calculations. In particular, as linear-scaling DFT codes are well established, calculations with thousands of atoms are not an obstacle any more (Goedecker, 1999
