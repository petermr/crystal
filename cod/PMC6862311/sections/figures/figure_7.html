 <caption> Magnitudes of the Fourier components | I n ( q 0 ) | as a function of the order number n for three different compounds: 3(10)OBC at the relative temperature Δ T = T − T C = − 5.3 °C ( a), 75OBC at Δ T = − 4.55 °C ( b) and PIRO6 at Δ T = − 4.3 °C ( c). The temperature Δ T is calculated relative to the respective temperature T C of the second-order Sm-A–Hex-B phase transition for each compound. Red lines show fitting using the MCST (adopted from Zaluzhnyy et al. [ 17]––Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry). Used under CC-BY 3.0. </caption>
