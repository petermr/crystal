<p>However, up until now, the above distribution functions for the material spring back and plastic side flow mainly established on some assumptions and no directly actual experimental observations have been performed to support these assumptions. For the theoretical method, only a few investigations, for instance the molecular dynamic simulation, are performed to analyze the generation of the two influencing factors. Hence, in the future study, the combination of theoretical simulation and experimental observation should be simultaneously employed in the analysis of height component in relation to the material spring back and plastic side flow. Furthermore, in the current investigations, the cross-section shape of the tool edge profile is usually fitted by a circular arc to obtain the cutting edge radius

 <sub>n</sub>. In fact, Xu et al. has theoretically noted that the shape of the cutting edge shape also affects the stagnation region, chip formation and cutting forces, etc., which should be also further clarified by the actual cutting experiments [
