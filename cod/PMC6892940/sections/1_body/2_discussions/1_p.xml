<p id="Par12">In a highly ordered 
 <italic>B</italic>-site double perovskite with magnetic ions at 
 <italic>B</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>′ sites the long range magnetic order is always determined by the type of active exchange interaction that mediates through the 
 <italic>B</italic>-O-
 <italic>B</italic>′ connectivity. For localized electrons (i.e. the 
 <italic>d</italic> electrons), the magnetic interaction between two transition metal 
 <italic>B</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>′ cations is often described by the Goodenough-Kanamori rules of superexchange interaction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. According to this rule, when the orbitals of two magnetic ions have a significant overlap integral, the superexchange is antiferromagnetic (∠

 <sub>6</sub> compounds, Ni 3
 <italic>d</italic> and Re 5
 <italic>d</italic> orbitals are connected via oxygen 2 
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals. From refinement of XRD and NPD, the average Ni-O-Re bond angle (∠NOR) comes about 160° for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 sample and ~152° for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 sample. Therefore in case of 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 sample, when ∠NOR is closer to 180°, the superexchange interaction between half filled

 <sup>5+</sup> is a weak ferromagnetic interaction. Of course, there could be magnetic signals appearing from independent Ni and Re sublattices as well. However, as the ∠NOR start deviating noticeably from 180° (e.g. 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0), a sizeable overlap between the 
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> orbitals starts to favor antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction between the partially filled Ni

 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> and Re 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> orbitals following the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. Further, we have noticed that the smaller volume of the 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 sample compared to 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0 sample has no significant effect in the Ni/Re-O bond lengths. The reduction of the lattice parameters are compensated by the smaller ∠NOR angles.
