<p>Described here is an investigation of analogous devices based on PDs prepared from a series of different commercially available, medical-grade, biocompatible silicone polymers with the goal of evaluating whether different formulations would affect the photochemical uncaging of NO. The photoNORM selected in these studies is the BF

 <sup>+</sup> (PetACrONO), where PetA = 5,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane, the synthesis of which is described. The PetACrONO salt is photoactive toward NO release in solution, is hydrophobic, and is readily infused into PDs prepared from these polymers. Nitric oxide uncaging from the resulting devices can be activated by visible light excitation.
