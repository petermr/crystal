<p>The RDF of Ca-H
 <sub>w</sub> and Ca-O
 <sub>w</sub> of montmorillonites with different charge density are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f006">Figure 6</xref>. By studying the RDF of Ca-H
 <sub>w</sub> and Ca-O
 <sub>w</sub> in the interlayer of montmorillonites with different charge density, we can study the action of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and water molecules between the layers of montmorillonite; therefore, the mechanism of the influence of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> on the distribution characteristics of water molecules can be further studied. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f006">Figure 6</xref> that calcium ions are closely related to oxygen atoms in water molecules, the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and the oxygen atoms in the water molecules are more tightly packed together than that of hydrogens so Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is more likely to have oxygen around than hydrogen in water molecules, and hydrated Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> are formed near the Si-O surface. Comparatively speaking, it can be seen that there is little difference in the RDF of Ca-H
 <sub>w</sub> and Ca-O
 <sub>w</sub> characteristics with the increases of layer charge density.
