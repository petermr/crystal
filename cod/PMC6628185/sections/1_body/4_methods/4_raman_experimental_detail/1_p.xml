<p>Raman experiments were performed by exciting the samples either with the 633 nm line of a HeNe laser or with the 514.5 nm line of an Ar
 <sup>+</sup>Kr
 <sup>+</sup> laser. The incident power was kept below 1 mW to avoid heating or damaging effects. The samples were illuminated with a high numerical aperture (0.95) 100× objective (if not differently specified), which allows a spatial resolution of about 600 nm for the 514.5 nm laser. The polarization of the incident laser light and of the backscattered beam can be controlled and selected by means of polarization optics. The scattered light was collected by a T64000 triple spectrometer in subtractive mode, equipped with a 1.800 g/mm grating and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector, providing a spectral resolution of 0.5–1 cm

 <italic>T</italic> = 5.5 K measurements were performed by loading samples in a He continuous-flow cryostat using the 514.5 nm laser.
