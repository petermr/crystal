<p>Atom probe tomography (APT) is a microscopy and microanalysis technique that maps the position of millions of atoms from a material in three-dimensions with subnanometer spatial resolution. The technique relies on the effect of intense electric fields to cause the desorption and ionization of the atoms that constitute the surface of a sharp, needle-shaped specimen. The ions are accelerated away from the specimen’s surface by the electric field and collected by a position-sensitive, time-resolved particle detector. The high curvature of the specimen’s tip (radius of curvature in the range of 20–200 nm) makes the electrostatic field highly divergent, and provides a very high magnification, in the range of 10
