<p>The morphology of the particles was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM JEOL 2100 and JEOL 1400+ microscopes, Tokyo, JAPAN) working at 200 or 120 kV acceleration voltage, respectively. HRTEM measurements were performed on the JEOL 2200FS microscope. Samples were prepared by dispersing a few milligrams of powder in ethanol with ultra-sonication and by directly depositing one drop of the as-prepared suspension on a carbon coated grid.</p>
