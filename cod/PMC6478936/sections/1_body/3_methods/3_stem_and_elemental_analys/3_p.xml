 <sub>2</sub>] and SrLiAl
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> particles. The high-current bunched mode and O

 <sup>+</sup> at 2 keV as sputter ion species were used for the depth profile analyses. For the element-specific high resolution imaging of the Sr[Li
 <sub>2</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>] particle, a field of view of 60 µm × 60 µm and a raster size of 256 × 256 pixels was used in burst alignment (unbunched) mode. For the latter analysis, a preselected Sr[Li
 <sub>2</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>] particle was positioned in the pocket of a copper TEM grid with 50 µm mesh width. To ensure that possible surface effects (contamination, surface topography etc.) do not influence the result, the ToF-SIMS depth profile analysis was not stopped until the intensity ratio I(Li
 <sup>+</sup>)/I(Sr
 <sup>+</sup>) reached a steady state within the particle bulk. The total ablation during sputtering was estimated to be some hundred nanometres. Since, due to the small size of the particles, the whole particle was thinned during the process, the exact total sputter depth could not be measured.
