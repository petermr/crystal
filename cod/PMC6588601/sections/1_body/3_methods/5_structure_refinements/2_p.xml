<p id="Par32">In both the neutron and X-ray cases, the calculated total-scattering data were corrected for the instrument resolution in reciprocal and real spaces prior to comparison with the corresponding experimental signals. The resolution corrections accounted for the actual peak profile shapes, which is especially important for the time-of-flight neutron data that exhibit significant peak asymmetry. The accuracy of these corrections is key for obtaining meaningful results while fitting a pair-distribution function to longer distances. The 3D X-ray diffuse scattering has been calculated according to the formalism outline by Butler and Welberry

 </sup>. Prior to comparison with the experimental data, the calculated diffuse-scattering intensity was smoothed using a 3D Gaussian filter. The weights assigned to individual data sets, which control the contribution of a given data set to the total residual, were adjusted during fitting using a newly developed automated routine that ensures that all individual residual terms, while allowed to increase temporarily, over time decrease to small user-preset values. This procedure, which involves an analysis of statistical correlations between changes in the aggregate residual function and each of its terms, drastically accelerates convergence of RMC refinements.
