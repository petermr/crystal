 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (0.607 mmol, 250 mg) and TOABr (0.696 mmol, 380 mg) were added to a 100-ml single-neck round-bottom flask and mixed with 30 ml of methanol. After being vigorously stirred for 30 min, the solution color changed from yellow to dark red. Then, various thiols (3.19 mmol for each synthesis) were added to the solution at room temperature. A milky, white floc was generated immediately. After ~15 min, a fresh NaBH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution (6 mmol, 227 mg, dissolved in 10 ml of nanopure water) was rapidly added to the solution under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution immediately turned black and produced Au particles, which were precipitated out of the methanol solution. The reaction was stopped after ~4.5 hours, and then the solution was removed. Black precipitates were washed with excess methanol and collected by centrifugation. This wash/precipitation procedure was repeated several times. The crude products that were dissolved in 1 ml of CH
