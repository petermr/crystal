<p>Because a difference between experimental and theoretical frequencies occurs regardless of the crystal symmetry involved (ZB, WZ, TSL), when comparing theory to experiment we will focus on the relative shift in the frequencies induced by the different crystal symmetries and not on the absolute frequency values. The agreement between theoretical and experimental frequency shifts is indeed very good. In going from the ZB to the WZ phase, TO and LO modes downshift by different, consistent amounts in both the theoretical and the experimental data. The frequencies of the modes in the TSL are in between the ZB and the WZ values, closer to the ZB. The E
