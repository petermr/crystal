<p id="Par51">The consideration of more complicated confining geometries, finite-size for the particles, and the role of repulsive and attractive potentials acting at different scales may give rise to interesting behaviors and applications of the interplay of active forces and aggregated phases of particles. This is material to be explored in the close future.</p>
