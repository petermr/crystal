<p>Yb(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> was reported by Kost et al. in 1978 [
 <xref rid="B239-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. The compound has a hydrogen content of 3.43 wt.%. It was produced in cold ether by the metathesis reaction between LiH, Al, and a metal halide. Kost et al. reported that Yb(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> is a yellow powder that decomposes at 70 Â°C. The decomposition products of Yb(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> are the hydrides of Al and Yb [
 <xref rid="B239-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. The YbH
 <sub>2</sub> is metastable at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B262-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>].
