<p>The effect of layer charge density on water moleculars diffusivity of montmorillonite at the molecular and atomic levels has been studied by MD techniques. In order to macroscopically study the effect of charge density on hydration performance of montmorillonite, some experimental studies on the hydration performance of montmorillonite were conducted. TG and DTG were used to study the thermal stability and the difference in water precipitation temperature among montmorillonites. The swelling capacity and the gelling value were used to evaluate the swelling and dispersibility of montmorillonite.</p>
