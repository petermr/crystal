<p>Earlier, we obtained systems based on perovskite-like structures of the type A(FeM)O

Moreover, according to the data obtained, the addition of the second component M = Ti result in the formation of structures with predominant phases containing oxide forms of titanium and its compounds with iron. During the study, it was found that the use of the method of mechanical chemical synthesis and subsequent thermal annealing allows to obtain a multiphase system containing a large number of oxide phases or complex non-stoichiometric compounds, which leads to disordering of the crystalline and magnetic texture. Despite the simplicity and efficiency of the application of the mechanical chemical method of synthesis to obtain perovskite-like structures, this method does not allow to obtain particles of nanoscale diameter with clearly controlled phase and stoichiometric compositions. One way to obtain such particles is to combine methods of chemical synthesis with subsequent thermal annealing of the nanoparticles obtained [
