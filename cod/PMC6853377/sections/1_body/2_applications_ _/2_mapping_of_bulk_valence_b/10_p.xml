<p>The curvature of the final-state sphere intersecting the periodic pattern of BZs offers a fascinating possibility for future electronic structure analysis. A large 
 <italic>k</italic>-field-of-view on the curved isosphere intersects several BZs with continuously varying 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> value. In Fig. 5(
 <italic>a</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> ▸</xref>
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> spans already half of the Γ–A distance of the BZ. The highest point is marked by X, the BZs above and below the X show an incomplete ring with three bars only and an inner hexagon with a bright spot in the center. The adjacent BZs left and right from X show complete rings with six bars and the spot in the inner hexagon is much weaker. The next nearest BZs in the upper part of the field of view show the small circles (arrows) originating from a Fermi-surface pocket located about midway between the ΓMK and ALH planes. These variations originate from the curved isosphere and thus are equivalent to a 
 <italic>k</italic>

  <italic>z</italic>

 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub>-levels exploiting the radial coordinate in the 
 <italic>k</italic>-images allows, in principle, mapping of the spectral function via measurements at few photon energies or even just one photon energy (if the imaged 
 <italic>k</italic>-field is large enough and/or the size of the BZ along 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> is small). In this context the possibility to work in the zero-extractor mode [Fig. 2(

 <italic>k</italic>-regions far away from the
