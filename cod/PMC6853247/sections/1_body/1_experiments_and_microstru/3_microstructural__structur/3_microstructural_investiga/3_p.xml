<p>In diffraction contrast (Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), wadsleyite displays characteristic planar defects in (010). The lamella is free of defects. It exhibits a crystallographic relationship with one of the olivine grains illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b where both the lamella and olivine grain 2 show similar contrast in weak‐beam dark‐field. A network of misfit dislocations is observed at the interface between the two phases (Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). This lamella located at the boundary between two olivine grains, which was clearly visible in the SEM images, is however not unique. Several thinner lamellae, which cannot be detected at the SEM scale, with the same orientation as the large lamella are observed within the olivine crystals (Figure 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).
