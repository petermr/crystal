 <sub>2</sub> and AlD
 <sub>3</sub> and further heating at 154 Â°C for 1 h in Ar [
 <xref rid="B229-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. SrAlD
 <sub>5</sub> was studied by synchrotron and neutron diffraction in detail; the resolved structure consists of (AlD
 <sub>6</sub>) octahedra that share corner D atom forming a chain (
