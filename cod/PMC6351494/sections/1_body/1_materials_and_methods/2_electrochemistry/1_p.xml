<p>The electrode slurry was prepared by mixing the 80 wt% of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> or Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> powder, 10 wt% of acetylene black (TIMCAL), and 10 wt% of polyimide binder (Toray) dissolved in anhydrous NMP. The mixed slurry was coated on the copper foil and dried at 80°C under vacuum and pressed. Subsequently the electrode were heated at 350°C under argon flow for the thermal imidization of the binder. The loading level of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> are within the range 2.8–3.3 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> thin film electrodes were used without further treatment.
