<p id="P14">To summarize, DFT calculations at the PBE-D3 level provided a reliable description of M
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) systems and revealed how non-covalent interactions with Ni(OEP) result in a substantial ordering effect for the endohedral cluster in Sc
 <sub>3</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> and YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub> molecules. Assuming thermodynamic control with thermal averaging over 2.5 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> (RT), the nitride clusters are predicted to be well ordered. However, the energy scale of this effect is rather narrow, and the ordering will disappear if the thermal energy range covers Δ
 <italic>E</italic> = 10 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. The results on YSc
 <sub>2</sub>N@C
 <sub>80</sub>·Ni(OEP) can be generalized to other EMFs with a middle-sized lanthanide in place of Y.
