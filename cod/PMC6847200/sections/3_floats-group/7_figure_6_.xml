 <caption>
  <p>Ligand recognition by the 
   <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II riboswitch aptamer domain. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Interactions between nucleotides in the three-way junction and the guanine moiety of the ligand. Hydrogen bonding interactions are shown as grey dashes. Note that two hydrogen bonding interactions are drawn between O2′ of U22 and the N7 and O6 of 2′-dG since these two interactions are nearly equidistant (2.9 and 2.7 Å, respectively). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Interactions between the 2′-deoxyribose moiety and RNA. The nucleobase moiety of the 2′-dG ligand (magenta) has been omitted for clarity. (
   <bold>C–E</bold>) Base triple between J2/3 and the second proximal base pair in P1 in the (

   <italic>env1</italic> 2′-dG-II riboswitch, (
