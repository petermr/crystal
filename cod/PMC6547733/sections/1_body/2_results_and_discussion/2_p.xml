<p id="Par11">To determine how the crystal structure, composition and electronic excitation concentration affect the transition temperature from crystalline to amorphous phase, we have monitored changes in both, the system energy (e.g. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and the radial distribution function (RDF), which has been calculated at the end of the simulation time for each temperature and structure investigated. A material is considered amorphous when the short-range order in its RDF is maintained but the long-range order is lost. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref> shows the effect of various electronic excitation concentrations on the RDF of cubic LZO at 300 K. The features of the RDF remain similar until an excitation concentration of 1.2%, at which point bonds between oxygen atoms start to form. The appearance of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules is associated with a modification of the intermediate and long-range ordering, suggesting the beginning of amorphization. At higher electronic excitation concentrations, the degree of amorphization increases with the number of O–O bonds formed. It is worth noting that a similar behavior has been obtained by Xiao

 </sup> during the simulation of the effect of electronic excitation in several titanate pyrochlores. Under the influence of electronic excitation, the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules in these materials is due to the electrons removed from the system, which mainly originate from oxygen 2
 <italic>p</italic> valence orbitals located near the Fermi level. The anion disorder resulting from the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub> molecules further induces cation displacements, together driving the structure toward an amorphous phase. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref> shows the evolution of the RDF features at different temperatures for an excitation concentration fixed at 0.8%. The RDFs show that the formation of O–O bonds starts at 600 K, which coincides with the beginning of amorphization.
