<p>The Z-axis density distribution curves of water molecules in montmorillonite layers with different layer charge characteristics are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f002">Figure 2</xref>. It can be seen from the left figure that the Z-axis density distribution of water molecules in the interlayer of Ca-montmorillonite has little difference, and the overall distribution was bimodal. The two peaks were distributed in the range of ±2.5 Å on both sides of the central axis among the two TOT sheets and were substantially symmetrical. Therefore, the different substitution sites had no significant effect on the Z-axis density distribution of water molecules. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02318-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows that the layer charge substitution sites had the same characteristics, as the charge density increased from 0.25 to 0.625, The water molecules in the montmorillonite layer move along the axis of the center. Moreover, the water molecules’ distribution range extended to both sides along the central axis, the left side moved from −1.7 Å to −2.5 Å, and the right side moved from 1.8 Å to 2.5 Å. The reason was that as the charge density of the montmorillonite layer increased, the polarity of the siloxane surface was strengthened, and the water molecules moved toward the siloxane surface on both sides of the interlayer by the hydrogen bonding force between the oxygen in the siloxane surface and the hydrogen in the water molecules.
