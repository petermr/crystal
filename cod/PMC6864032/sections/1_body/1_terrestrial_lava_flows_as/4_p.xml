 </sup> proposed for nakhlites and Theo’s Flow, respectively, a mechanism of emplacement with subsequent injections blanketing one another, but this hypothesis has never been tested. Given the analogy with Martian lava flows, the mechanism and timing of differentiation of Theo’s Flow deserves further investigation to shed light on these geological processes on Mars.
