<p>The site and orbital-projected densities of states (DOS) for paraelectric and ferroelectric phases for their respective ground-state magnetic configurations are shown in

 </xref>a,b, respectively. It can be seen that the V 3d states and O 2p states are spread over in the valence band in a range of −7 eV to Fermi level (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>F</sub>). The energetically degenerate nature of these two states indicates the presence of strong covalent hybridization between V and O. This hybridization weakens the short-range repulsion to lower the energy of the ferroelectric phase. The filled O 2s states form narrow bands around −18 eV (see 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>b). Above that, at around −9 eV, the Pb 6s lone pair electronic states are present with small contributions from 2p electrons. This also confirms that the 6s electrons are stereochemically active and not inert. Although the Pb 6p states are well separated from its 6
 <italic>s</italic> states and are mostly present in conduction band (CB), a small amount of Pb 6p states can be seen, which are degenerate with O 2p states confirming the Pb–O covalency. The hybridization between these states enhances the stability of the ferroelectric phase by lowering the total energy of the system. The partial DOS for PbTi

A similar kind of DOS distribution can be seen for Pb, V, and O atoms in PbTi

 <sup>4+</sup>. Due to the covalent interaction between Ti and O, the charges redistribute among themselves for which we see very small yet notable DOS in Ti valence band.
