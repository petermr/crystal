 <sub>g</sub> vs. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>f</sub> plot of the fabricated LEDs. The ideal value of the (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>g</sub>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>f</sub>) is (100, 100). The deviation of the values indicates whether the light source produces under/over-saturated images or low fidelity images. The 1B-Y LED PKG exhibits low R
 <sub>g</sub> and R
 <sub>f</sub> values indicating the LED produces low fidelity and low-saturated images. All the other LED PKGs exhibit reasonable (R
 <sub>g</sub>, R
 <sub>f</sub>) values. The optimum value was achieved for the 1B-BYR LED PKG, which has (R
 <sub>g</sub>, R
 <sub>f</sub>) values of (95, 101) and produces images with high fidelity and nearly perfect saturation. Note that 1B-BYR LED PKG did not have all the CRI points above 95. The PKG-1-1UV2B-GR and PKG-2-1UV2B-GR LEDs can be used to produce images with high fidelity and high saturation because of its high (R
 <sub>g</sub>, R
 <sub>f</sub>) values.
