<p>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.9%), NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl (99.9%), and Pr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (99.9%) were selected as raw materials. Because NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl volatilizes at high temperature, 20 mol% excess of NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl was needed to compensate for the loss of volatilization. All these chemicals were evenly mixed in an agate mortar for about 30 min. Afterwards, the mixed powders were put into an alumina crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 540 °C for 1 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, Bi
 <sub>1−x</sub>OCl:xPr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors were taken out and ground into powder for further measurement. In order to verify the potentiality of Bi
 <sub>1−x</sub>OCl:xPr
 <sup>3+</sup> phosphors on w-LEDs, an w-LED device was fabricated, combining a blue GaN chip with the BiOCl:Pr
 <sup>3+</sup> and self-made K
 <sub>2</sub>GeF
 <sub>6</sub>:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors with a mass ratio of 100:1. Then, the mixed phosphors were dispersed in epoxy resin and coated on a blue GaN chip with an intense emission peak at 460 nm. The coated chip was dried in an oven at 100 °C for 3 h, and finally the w-LED device was obtained.
