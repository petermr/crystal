<p>Triboelectrification‐induced electroluminescence (TIEL) has been considered as a novel luminescent which is capable to convert the dynamic motions to luminescent signals by extremely gentle mechanical interactions. It relies on the coupling of triboelectrification and electroluminescence (EL). During the process, tribocharges are generated through the dynamic interactions between two different materials, which further alter the surrounding electric potential (up to hundreds of volts) within milliseconds. This dramatic variation in electric potential excites the EL of the embedded phosphors. TIEL displays significant advantages over ML, such as the low‐stress threshold value, high‐stress responsivity, and the nondestructive property.

 <sup>+</sup>, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and others) ZnS particles combing with PDMS elastomeric matrix. By now, TIEL device has been widely applied in real‐time sensing, anticounterfeiting, self‐powered illumination, and human/machine interactive display.
