<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03997-f002">Figure 2</xref>, with the increase of the charge density in the montmorillonite, the water molecules in the interlayer gradually evolved from a random disordered arrangement into H
 <sub>w</sub> (H in the water molecules) turning to the siloxane surface of montmorillonite, while O
 <sub>w</sub> (O in the water molecules) deviated from the siloxane surface. The above simulation results show that the charge density characteristics of montmorillonite has a significant influence on its hydration characteristics and interlayer ions distribution.
