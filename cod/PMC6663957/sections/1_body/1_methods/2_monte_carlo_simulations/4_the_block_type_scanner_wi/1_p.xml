<p id="Par34">In order to validate if the results are independent of the crystal size, a similar block-type scanner with smaller crystals (1.0 × 1.0 × 10.0 mm
 <sup>3</sup>) was simulated using Gate v7.2. The scanner is made of 2 (24) blocks of 16 × 16 detectors in an axial (transaxial) direction where the blocks are arranged on a dodecagon prism. The inner radius of the scanner is 67 mm. Cristal gap and block gap are 0.1 and 0.3, respectively.
