<p id="Par15">With regards to the first question of whether changes in the magnetic ordering energy, or energetic difference between the stripe ground state and checkerboard excited state, result from the small difference in planar lattice parameters, we find only a small change (0.4%) in this energy, from 51.6 meV/Fe for ‘crystal a’, to 51.8 meV/Fe for ‘crystal b’. This means that the observed ~ 10% Néel temperature variation does not result from changes in this ordering energy. At the same time, one should note that the observed 0.2% change in lattice parameter from ‘crystal a’ to ‘b’ corresponds to an effective chemical pressure of several tenths of a GPA, and pressure is a well-known means of

 <sub>N</sub> suppression. While it remains possible that this effective planar strain is relevant here, arguing against this is the fact that the smaller lattice parameter ‘crystal a’ has the larger Néel point, whereas the application of pressure, thereby yielding smaller lattice constants, generally lowers the
