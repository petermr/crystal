<p>A small squared region containing the elementary cell was cropped from the original image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f003">Figure 3</xref>c), far from the dislocation region. Bicubic spline interpolation of pixels was performed to obtain the scale of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01804-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. The red circles in the figure correspond to spheres of radius r = a/2 = 0.3073/2 = 0.1537 nm, one half of the SiCâ€™s lattice parameter a = 0.3073 nm at 300 K. Using this parameter, the corresponding hexagon connecting centers of spheres can be sketched.
