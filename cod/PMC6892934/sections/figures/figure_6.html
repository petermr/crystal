 <caption> Total GND density plotted on YZ, XZ and the XY cross-sections through the indent centre. GND density was calculated using L2 optimisation. Predictions from CPFE calculations are shown in ( a) and ( b) for the unimplanted sample, and ( e) and ( f) for the helium-implanted sample. GND density computed from Laue diffraction measurements for the unimplanted and implanted samples are shown in ( c) 34 and ( g) respectively. GND density determined by HR-EBSD for the unimplanted and the implanted sample is shown in ( d) and ( h) respectively. The same colour scale is used for all plots showing log 10(ρ) with ρ in 1/µm 2. ( a), ( c), ( e) and ( g) are plotted on the same length scale. ( b), ( d), ( f) and ( h) show magnified plots of GND density and are also all shown on the same length scale. </caption>
