<p>POWGEN entered the user program at SNS in late 2010 with a somewhat limited detector coverage of 30–130° in 2Θ and most of the detectors in plane (12 modules of scintillator-based wavelength shifting fiber neutron detectors). The detector complement was gradually increased over the next couple of years to 30 modules. Significant improvement in instrument performance was also achieved through advances in event positioning algorithms and scintillators (Wang, 2016
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb42"> ▸</xref>, 2015

Even with the various improvements since entering the user program, POWGEN was operating at a much lower performance level than envisioned in the original design. The instrument was unable to reach its full potential owing to the slow overall count rate and compromised engineering design that included shadowing of detectors, flexing of Al windows during evacuation of the tank

The neutron beam delivered from the 5 m interchangeable guides is within the instrument performance specification and thus the front end of the instrument, which includes the moderator, disc choppers and neutron guide, was not a part of this upgrade and remains unchanged.
