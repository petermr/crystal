<p>The alanates of the transition metals date from the 1950sâ€“1960s. Although most of them have decomposition temperatures too low for hydrogen storage purposes, some of them can be of interest. However, almost all of the reported materials have been poorly characterized. Normally, the old reports did not present the basic characterization of materials, for example, X-ray diffraction or infrared spectroscopy. On the other hand, some of them have only been theoretically discussed. In the following sections, the most important (experimental and/or theoretical) characteristics of this family of alanates are presented. </p>
