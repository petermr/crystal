<p id="Par42">In order to obtain high-quality 2D/3D Raman orientation maps, we developed and experimentally verified all required data acquisition and data analysis steps. The overview of SAROM workflow is shown in Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>. It consists of six different steps: (i) the development and construction of the Raman setup, which is capable to acquire simultaneously nine polarized Raman spectra from each scanning point on the sample; (ii) the development of preprocessing and artifacts correction algorithms applied to the polarized Raman spectra; (iii) the development and verification of the Raman tensor model; (iv) single acquisition Raman orientation mapping at multiple polarization channels; (v) fitting of Euler angles at each mapping point and (vi) the color code-based representation of the orientation map.
