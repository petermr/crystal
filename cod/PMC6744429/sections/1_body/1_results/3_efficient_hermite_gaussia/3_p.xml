<p id="Par17">The “arg” and “amp” functions denote the phase and amplitude of the target SH HG(1, 1) beam. The period along the 
 <italic>x</italic>-direction is 3 μm in each grating. The 
 <italic>x–z</italic> cross-section of the 3D NPC has dimensions of about 32 μm × 32 μm. Along the 
 <italic>y</italic>-axis, there are 30 periods with an interval of 3 μm. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the generated SH patterns. The petal-like intensity distributions in the ±1st diffraction orders agree well with the theoretically predicted HG(1, 1) beam. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> presents the output power dependence of the SH HG beam on the pump wavelength. Clearly, the SH power reaches its peak at 818 nm, which indicates that QPM comes into action. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, when the pump power is 1.2 W, the conversion efficiency is measured to be ~3.9 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> (the normalized conversion efficiency is 1.95 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> W
 <sup>−1</sup>) for each SH HG mode, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the value obtained for the 2D case
