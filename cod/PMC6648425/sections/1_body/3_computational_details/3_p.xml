<p>We specified initial magnetic moments for each Co atom considering the crystal field effect at the Co sites (octahedral and pyramidal symmetry). In the calculations, the Pr 4f orbitals were treated as the core states (valence electron configuration: 5s
 <sup>2</sup>5p
 <sup>6</sup>5d
 <sup>1</sup>6s
 <sup>2</sup>) in the Pr pseudopotential, since Pr is not attributed to the experimentally observed magnetization above the temperature of 20 K,

 </sup> and the treatment of Pr 4f as the valence states in the pseudopotential is known to have nonphysical computational consequences.
