<p>To fulfil such requirement, recent advances in the surface topography modeling of a diamond turned component is summarized and discussed in this work, which follows the modeling process of surface topography. First, the surface profile model in relation to one feed rate is analyzed and the corresponding models with the influencing factors in this spatial dimensional, such as tool edge waviness, material spring back and plastic side flow are presented. Afterwards, based on the surface topography in one feed rate, the 2D surface topography in the radial direction can be achieved with consideration of vibration between diamond tool and workpiece. Finally, general models for 3D surface topography are acquired and the influencing factors in this spatial dimension, i.e., mechanical properties in relation to the work material are discussed and recommended to be integrated into the surface topography model. Furthermore, challenges and outlooks for the surface topography model of diamond turned components can be achieved according to the above results. </p>
