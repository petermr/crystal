<p id="Par38">Focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out cross-section samples (~3 μm thick) were made from the indent-centre in the implanted and unimplanted samples using a Zeiss Auriga FIB-SEM. For HR-EBSD measurements, lift-outs were thinned from one side to ~1.5 μm thickness using a 30 kV, 240 pA ion beam, followed by low energy ion beam polishing (2 kV, 200 pA, 10 minutes) to remove FIB damage. For TEM characterization, the lift-out specimens were further thinned to ~100 nm using FIB, and then flash polished (1% NaoH aqueous solution, 0.05 s, 8 V, 298 K). Though the FIB lift-out preparation removes constraints perpendicular to the foil, the in-plane lattice strains and rotations are expected to remain largely unchanged.</p>
