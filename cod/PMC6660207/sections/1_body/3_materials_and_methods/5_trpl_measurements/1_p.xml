<p>The fluorescence lifetime measurement was performed using a confocal microscope with a 50Ã— long focus lens. A 400-nm pulse excitation (8 MHz, 100 fs) was introduced to the sample, and the PL emission from sample was analyzed by a single-photon avalanche diode to resolve the time decay. A 458-nm long-pass and 720-nm short-pass filter were used to select out the PL.</p>
