<p id="Par17">SAROM consists of a Laser Beam Delivery System (LBDS), which directs three laser beams with different orientations of polarization state on the sample focal plane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and an aberration-corrected Raman Beam Delivery System (RBDS) (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>) with Wollaston Analyzer Unit (WAU), capable of splitting the Raman beam into on-axis and off-axis scattering geometries collected with different analyzer orientations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b–e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). In a 2D mapping configuration, the sample is illuminated with a single laser source. Three laser beams with different orientations of polarization state are spatially separated on the sample and on the spectroscopic CCD focal planes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b-e</xref>). In a 3D mapping configuration, the sample is illuminated with three laser sources. Three laser beams with different orientations of polarization state overlap on the sample, however, they become separated on spectroscopic CCD focal plane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) due to slightly different excitation wavelengths (see “Methods” section for details).
