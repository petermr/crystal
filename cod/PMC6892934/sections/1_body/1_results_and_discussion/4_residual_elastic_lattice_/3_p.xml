<p id="Par23">The Laue data and CPFE predictions of lattice rotations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a–d)</xref>) agree reasonably well, particularly for 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>. Interestingly, agreement is better for slices 5 µm away from the indent centre (positions 1 and 3 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(c,d)</xref>). The disparity between CPFE and Laue data in position 2 is due to the presence of steep strain gradients and rapid variation of lattice rotation at the indent centre. In positions 1 and 3, rotations in the unimplanted sample, particularly 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>, are significantly larger than in the implanted sample. For quantitative analysis, line plots were extracted, for these two slices, at depths of 4.5 µm from the sample surface, from both Laue and CPFE results and superimposed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The line plots distinctly show the smaller lattice rotations in the implanted sample, suggesting a more localised deformation.
