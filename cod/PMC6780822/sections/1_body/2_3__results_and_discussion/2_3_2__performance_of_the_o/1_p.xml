<p>A conventional bottom emission white OLED device for flat-panel display products was fabricated. The characteristics of the OLED devices with and without the YSZ scattering layer are illustrated as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01241-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The OLED devices had three peaks at red, green, and blue color wavelengths. The OLED devices were used as the light sources to investigate the enhancement of light efficiency of the OLED with an embedded YSZ scattering layer.
