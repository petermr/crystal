Iron and nickel concentrations are higher in the lamella than in olivine, but, more importantly, the lamella shows significant deficiency in silicon compared to olivine. EDS analyses were performed inside and on both sides of the lamella. To ensure the accuracy of the quantifications, we have verified that the phase composition around the lamella matches with stoichiometric olivine and wadsleyite. We have found on both sides of the lamella, compositions of Mg
 <sub>1.75</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.2</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.05</sub>Si
 <sub>0.99</sub>O
 <sub>4.01</sub> and Mg
 <sub>1.89</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.1</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.01</sub>SiO
 <sub>4</sub> for wadsleyite and olivine, respectively. Both minerals display therefore a general composition of (Mg, Fe, Ni)
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>4</sub>, with a (Mg+Fe)/Si ratio of 2. The composition of the lamella is Mg
 <sub>1.99</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.21</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.05</sub>Si
 <sub>0.84</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, which can also be written as (Mg, Fe, Ni)
 <sub>13.8</sub>Si
 <sub>5.04</sub>O
 <sub>24</sub>. It has therefore a (Mg+Fe)/Si ratio of 2.738. Next to the lamella, an ultrafine layer a few nanometers thick (grey arrow in Figures 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="ggge21980-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) is enriched in silicon and oxygen. Quantification of this ultrafine layer is consistent with a SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composition.
