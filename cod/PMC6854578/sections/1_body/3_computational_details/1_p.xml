<p>In this work, the interfacial structure between NaCl crystal and its solution has been studied, in which the interface is parallel to the (001) surface of NaCl crystal. The SPC/E model

 </sup> and the Joung–Cheatham (JC) model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>
 </sup> were used for water molecules and ions, respectively. The JC model has been improved to reproduce the experimental hydration free energies of ions and the lattice constants.
