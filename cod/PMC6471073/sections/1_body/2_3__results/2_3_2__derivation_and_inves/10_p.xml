<p>In the design of DRGs, the outer diameter of the DRG is always firstly confirmed based on the requirement of the sensor’s size and then the other parameters are confirmed based on the preferred performances. Here, the numerical solution and changing rules of the natural frequencies, effective mass, Coriolis mass, and angular gain with different geometrical parameters are studied as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00181-f014">Figure 14</xref>a–d. The outer diameter of the DRG is set at a constant 8 mm. The anchor radius,
