<p id="Par6">Next, we have performed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the 
 <italic>L</italic>-edge of Ni to further verify the charge state. The XAS spectra collected for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 compositions are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, together with the reference spectra for Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>3+</sup>. The reference spectra are obtained by digitizing and recalling the data points from the Figs. 4 and 6(a) of the ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Note that the La 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> absorption edge is superimposed with the Ni 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub>-edge. The spectral features of both the Ni 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> are quite different for Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>3+</sup>. Both 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> consist of two peaks indicated by the arrows in the figure. In the 2+ charge state of Ni as in NiO, the lower energy peak of 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> is much more intense relative to the higher energy one, while both the peaks have similar intensities in case of NdNiO
 <sub>3</sub>, PrNiO
 <sub>3</sub> and LaNiO
 <sub>3</sub>, containing Ni
 <sup>3+</sup> ions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Also, the spectral feature of the 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> edge of all the three compositions, clearly resemble to that of NiO. Hence it can be inferred that Ni is in 2+ charge state for all the LSCNRO compositions. In order to maintain charge neutrality, the charge state of Re should then be 5+ as Sr
 <sup>2+</sup>, La
 <sup>3+</sup> and O
 <sup>2−</sup> are expected to be very stable at their respective ionic states.
