 <caption> The object of the study: ( a) the azo–benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) star with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide core and three azobenzene arms. Each arm carries the N, N-dimethylamino group. Here, the optimized geometry is shown [ 14]. A snapshot of the columnar aggregate with N = 20 from MD trajectory [ 29] is illustrated in panel ( b). The azobenzene star studied experimentally by Lee et al. [ 17] is depicted in panel ( c). The conformation of this star is the same as in the crystalline structure, shown in panel ( d). Here, a = 59.37 A ˚ , b = 9.42 A ˚ and c = 39.95 A ˚ ; α = β = 90° and γ = 103.16°. The original unit cell [ 17] is multiplied twice along the b-direction to illustrate the stacking of the stars. The panel ( e) shows the stack made of 20 such molecules. The carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms are colored dark grey, light grey, red and blue spheres, respectively. </caption>
