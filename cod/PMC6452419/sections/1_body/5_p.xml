<p>Up to now, we generally considered two or three distinct 
 <italic>f</italic> values to ensure the robustness of any observation of trends associated with DORI fingerprints.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> Such arbitrary choices are, in the best case, nonideal and, in the worst case, may lead to inaccurate conclusions. Picking a single DORI-
 <italic>f</italic> value would be especially inconsistent when the experimentally measured electron density is obtained under different thermodynamic conditions (e.g., pressure and temperature) and is therefore not one-to-one comparable. Here we overcome the arbitrariness of selecting DORI isovalues by exploiting an algorithm that continuously and automatically monitors the DORI basins and the positions of their merging points while decreasing the 
 <italic>f</italic> value. Taking the average of the DORI-
 <italic>f</italic> values of all of the bond merging points gives a meaningful and unique choice of the 
 <italic>f</italic> value at which the covalent bonds are analyzed. This uniqueness together with the ability of DORI to simultaneously reveal covalent and noncovalent regions provides a breakthrough in assessing how high pressure affects the peculiar interplay between bonding patterns and compression packing.
