 <caption> Hard X-ray valence-band mapping using the high-energy ToF momentum microscope. ( a) Measured large-area k-space map at the Fermi energy for the d-bands of Re taken at hν = 3.830 keV ( T ≃ 30 K). The k x – k y section shows a cut through the center BZ and the first and second ring of repeated BZs. ( b) The same with marked small circular features, indicating the curvature of the final state energy isosphere in k-space. The top of the sphere is marked by a cross; the scale bar quantifies the momentum axes. ( c) E B-versus- k y cut along the dashed line in ( b) showing the band dispersions. ( d)–( f) k x – k y sections at higher photon energies as given on top of the panels. </caption>
