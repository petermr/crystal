<p id="Par14">In conclusion, we demonstrated sky-blue PeLED with EQE of 11% and blue PeLED with EQE of 4.8%, by overcoming the limitation from the low PLQE of wide-bandgap perovskites. The combination of layered perovskite formation and YCl
 <sub>3</sub> incorporation enhances the PLQE from 1.1% to 49.7%, which also enhance the material stability by suppressing ion migration. This study reveals that the low PLQE in most Cl:Br-based perovskites films limits the LED efficiency. Further research to improve the PLQE of wide-bandgap perovskite films to 100% should increase the EQE of sky-blue-emission PeLEDs to over 20%.
