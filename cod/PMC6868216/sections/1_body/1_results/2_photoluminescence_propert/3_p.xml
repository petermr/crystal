<p id="Par11">To evaluate the robustness of phosphors to heat and moisture, two sets of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu samples were exposed to the extremely environmental condition at 80% relative humidity and 80 °C. The results suggest that the chemical stability of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is relatively good (see details in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> content rarely changed to Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> depending on the prolonging duration time suggesting the good stability. One can also note that a small amount of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup> can be detected for the freshly prepared materials (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Samples with different Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>-doping concentrations (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.005–0.05) have been prepared to optimize the PL intensity of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>, the emission intensities increase slightly till up to 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.01 and then decrease with further increase in 
 <italic>x</italic>. Based on the Dexter’s theory and the Eu-Eu distances in K

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>, energy transfer among the nearest neighbor ions accounts for the observed concentration quenching (see details in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). The internal quantum efficiency of selected K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:0.01Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> is measured to be about 15% (
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>ex</sub> = 460 nm). Furthermore, one can find that the normalized emission peaks of K
 <sub>3</sub>LuSi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> show no shift as Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> doping content increase (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b</xref>).
