 <sub>2</sub> are 2.687 and 2.617, respectively. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> shows the BVS mapping of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> using the refined structure model with discussed in Electrochemical properties of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> and Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> composite electrode. The BVS mappings of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> clearly show 2D layered diffusion pathways connecting the 2
 <italic>d</italic> tetrahedral sites at cut off value: |ΔV| = 0.45 as shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref>. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> shows a migration path between the two tetrahedral sites of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>. The Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ion at the tetrahedral site is preferred to migrate to the next tetrahedral site, via the interstitial octahedral site. The estimated migration path is in good agreement with the proposed diffusion path model for Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> by DFT-NEB simulations (Rong et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Jung et al. also reported that the migration barrier in between two tetrahedral sites of Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> is 0.30 eV, suggesting fast Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> mobility in the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> phase (Jung and Han, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In addition, once the vacancy is formed, the fast migration of the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> from the octahedral site to the vacancy at the tetrahedral site is also expected (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Even though the BVS mapping is not as accurate as DFT modeling, the estimated Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> diffusion pathways are qualitatively informative to discuss the fast Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> mobility in the solid phase. We also performed the BVS mapping of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> as shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D,E</xref>. At glance, the estimated diffusion pathways look similar to the mapping of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>, however all the preferred diffusion path at interstitial octahedral sites are isolated at cut off value: |ΔV| = 0.45, as seen in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref> shows the 2D layered diffusion pathways in the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> formed at cut off value: |ΔV| = 0.6. The higher cut off value indicates that the higher migration barrier of the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub> (Fedotov et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The BVS mapping results suggests that the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> migration in Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub> is qualitatively faster than in Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Sb
 <sub>2</sub>. Though we still need further validation analyses, all the results are consistent with the contribution of the fast Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> mobility to the excellent electrochemical properties of the Mg
 <sub>3</sub>Bi
 <sub>2</sub>.
