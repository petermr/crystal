<p>Dipole orientation of water molecules is another important physical quantity to describe the ordering of water molecules in the FHS. The dipole orientation of water molecules is characterized by φ angles (see 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>), and the distribution of cos(φ) in the first layer is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>. The dipole of water molecules around both Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup> in the solution prefers to point to a special direction, which is consistent with the previous results.

 </sup> This special orientation, which minimizes the Coulomb interaction between the central ion and nearest water molecules, can be maintained in the interface beyond the first layer. However, in the first layer, due to the strong effect of crystal surface, the distribution of the dipole is no longer confined to a sharp region and is broadened. Namely, the dipole orientation of water molecules in the FHS is more disordered than that in the solution. For both type I and type II Na
 <sup>+</sup>, the distribution of cos(φ) in the first layer is similar, but different from that in solutions: a new peak appears near cos(φ) = 0.78, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>a. For type II Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, the distribution of cos(φ) is similar to that in solution except a slight shift for the peak, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>b. However, for type I Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, the distribution of cos(φ) is broadened remarkably relative to that of type II Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, and even some φ angles locate at the region where the interaction between Cl
 <sup>–</sup> and dipole becomes unstable locally.
