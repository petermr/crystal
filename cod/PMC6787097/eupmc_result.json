    "In this study, Tb3+-doped natural sodium feldspar (NaAlSi3O8) phosphors have been successfully prepared using high-temperature solid-state method with natural sodium feldspar as a substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis (EDX) of NaAlSi3O8 showed that 0.03 wt% of Eu element was present, and elemental distribution mapping analysis showed that the distribution of trace Eu in minerals was aggregated. The crystal structure and luminescence properties of the natural sodium Eu-containing feldspar and synthetic sodium feldspar NaAlSi3O8:Eu3+, Tb3+ phosphors are discussed in detail. The crystal structure analysis of the samples showed that the Na+ in the natural matrix was partly replaced by the doped Tb3+. Studies on the photoluminescence properties of the samples indicate that Eu does not form a luminescent center in the natural mineral, however, the strong characteristic peak of Eu3+ at 615 nm appears after doping with Tb3+ and the peak at 615 nm increases with the increase of Tb3+ concentration. According to the above spectral results, the energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ is obtained. Through the measurement and analysis of color coordinates, it is found that with the increase of Tb3+ concentration, the luminescence color of the samples can be regulated in the green to red region. NaAlSi3O8:Eu3+ Tb3+ phosphors has potential application value."
