<p id="Par11">Thermal stability acts as a vital parameter for LED phosphors in practical applications since the LED chip normally reaches temperatures up to ~150 °C at high power. The thermal quenching behavior can be elucidated using the configurational coordinate diagram. Based on this model, the excited luminescent center is thermally activated through phonon interaction and then released through the crossing point between the excited and ground states
 <sup>

 </sup>. Hence, thermal quenching is related to the difference between the equilibrium distance of the ground and excited state (ΔR) in the configurational coordinate diagram, which determines the location of the crossing point
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, if the value of ΔR is small, the Stokes shift will be small
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Generally, a phosphor with a smaller Stokes shift has stronger structural rigidity

 </sup>, which could significantly reduce the emission loss with increasing temperature. The temperature-dependent emission spectra of NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> phosphor in the temperature range from RT to 250 °C are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. At 150 °C, NKLSO:8%Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> exhibits an integrated emission loss of only 7%, and the emission intensity of the peak (486 nm) is decreased by 25% of the initial intensity, indicating good thermal stability of NKLSO:Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). And the variation between the peak intensity and the integrated intensity can be attributed to the broadening effect of the emission band with increasing temperature.
