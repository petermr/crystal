 <p xml:lang="fr">Anhydrous phase B (Anh‐B) is a dense magnesium silicate with composition (Mg, Fe)
  <sub>14</sub>Si
  <sub>5</sub>O
  <sub>24</sub>, which is expected to form in Mg‐rich or Si‐depleted regions of the mantle. We show that due to strong crystallographic similarities with the crystal structure of olivine, it can form directly from it as a metastable phase. We show that Anh‐B exhibits a moderate seismic anisotropy, which makes its detection difficult in the mantle.
