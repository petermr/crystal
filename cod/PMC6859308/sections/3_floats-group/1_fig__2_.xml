 <caption>
  <p>(
   <italic>A</italic>) Fe X-ray fluorescence map showing a cluster of Hz crystals grown in an infected red blood cell (iRBC) labeled 
   <italic>E</italic> prior to introduction of the BrQ drug, as well as several free-floating Hz crystals labeled Hz1, Hz2, and so on outside the red blood cell. There is a weak (light bluish) Fe signal in the red blood cell originating from hemoglobin still not digested by the parasite. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Magnification of the Hz1 map showing Fe signal (
   <italic>Left</italic>) and bromine (Br) signal (
   <italic>Right</italic>). (
   <italic>C</italic>) The theoretical growth form of Hz crystals (
   <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) emphasizing that the {100} and {010} are the prevailing faces. (
   <italic>D</italic>) Section through the Fe map shown in 
   <italic>B</italic>, along the crystal needle axis (in orange) and transverse to it (in green).
