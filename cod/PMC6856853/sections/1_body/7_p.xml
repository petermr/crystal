<p>The solid state structure of 
 <bold>2</bold> (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201909423-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) shows a 
 <italic>trans</italic>‐diarsene HAs=AsH ligand, which coordinates to an Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub> fragment in equatorial position (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201909423-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The As−As distances in 
 <bold>2</bold> (two independent molecules 2.3680(5), 2.3683(8) Å) is between an As−As single bond (2.42 Å) and an As=As double bond (2.28 Å) and can be considered as being an elongated double bond.
 <xref rid="anie201909423-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> This slight elongation, which is due to the back bonding from the Fe(CO)
 <sub>4</sub> moiety,
 <xref rid="anie201909423-bib-0004a" ref-type="ref">4a</xref> is much shorter than in the dinuclear U complex 
 <bold>A</bold>. The positions of the hydrogen atoms bonded to arsenic were located from the difference Fourier map and subsequently refined with fixed coordinates.

 <italic>trans</italic> isomer of As
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>2</sub> is present in the complex and only a minor amount of the 
 <italic>cis</italic> isomer could be refined in the crystal structure of 
 <bold>2</bold> (cf. Supporting Information). This is in line with the results of DFT calculations showing that the 
 <italic>trans</italic> isomer of 
 <bold>2</bold> is thermodynamically preferred by 7.60 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> over the 
 <italic>cis</italic> isomer.
 <xref rid="anie201909423-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Similarly, at the same level of theory, the parent 
 <italic>trans</italic>‐diarsene HAs=AsH is with 11.25 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> more stable than the 
 <italic>cis</italic>‐isomer.
