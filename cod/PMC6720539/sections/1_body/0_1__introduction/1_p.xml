<p>Montmorillonite has a two-dimensional nano-scale layered structure [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its TOT crystal structure unit is aluminum-oxygen octahedron in the middle and silica-oxygen tetrahedron in the upper and lower layers [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The interlayer of its TOT unit (so-called interlayer domain) usually contains a certain amount of water molecules and some exchangeable cations, so it has higher cation exchange capacity and higher water absorption and expansion capacity [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The hydration properties of montmorillonite have great influence on its application in various fields such as organic modification of montmorillonite, preparation of nanocomposite materials, drilling mud, pollution control, soil improvement, and others [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03997" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; therefore, it is very important to study the hydration properties of montmorillonite.
