<p id="p0040">The synthesis sequence leading to O5H-OMeDPA started with the acid-catalyzed cyclization of 1,1′-binaphthalene-2,2′-diol, which is followed by bromination and Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) for 1 g O5H-OMeDPA in our laboratory is estimated to be less than one-tenth of that for spiro-OMeTAD (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2018</xref>), which makes large-scale synthesis and application viable. The molecular geometry optimization by density functional theory (DFT) method reveals that the oxa[5]helicene segment distorts with a torsion angle of 27.92° and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of O5H-OMeDPA is delocalized over the whole π-conjugated skeleton, which is decisive for intermolecular hole hopping (
