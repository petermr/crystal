<p id="Par20">We implemented the block geometry in both axial and transaxial directions in the STIR library and investigated if the implementation of such a realistic model is worth the time and computational expense. The new implemented model permits the image reconstruction without the interpolation step. Therefore, LORs can be described more accurately which in turn leads to more accurate localization of radiotracers. Details of the implementation along with the evaluation of the reconstruction are described in the next sections.</p>
