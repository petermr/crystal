<p>Quantum mechanical calculations of IR spectra of crystalline melamine were successfully carried out for an infinite (3D periodic) lattice model. All of the experimental IR bands were accurately reproduced, even when using reasonably affordable harmonic approximation. On the other hand, finite models gave very inaccurate calculated IR spectra. In contrast, the NIR spectrum of crystalline melamine was accurately modeled by anharmonic calculations that are based on the model of a single molecule. It is a striking difference in the dependence of the quality vs. model complexity, between these two spectral regions. This result may be explained based on direct comparison of the molecular motions corresponding to the vibrations being influential for the IR and NIR regions.</p>
