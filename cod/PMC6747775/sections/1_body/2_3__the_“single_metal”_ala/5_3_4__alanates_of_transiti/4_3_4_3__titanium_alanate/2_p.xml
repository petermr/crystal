<p>Further decomposition of AlH
 <sub>3</sub> was observed at 110 °C [
 <xref rid="B241-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. No more characteristics of this material have been reported. However, Ti(AlH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub> can be a very interesting material in regards to its hydrogen content, perhaps tailoring the dehydrogenation temperature with some structural or chemical modification could be explored. Another point to discuss is that Ti can work in other oxidation states besides Ti
 <sup>4+</sup>; for example, Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> or Ti
 <sup>2+</sup>. The Ti
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ti
 <sup>2+</sup> compounds are generally more stable than the Ti
 <sup>4+</sup> compounds, i.e., the liquid and volatile TiCl
 <sub>4</sub> versus solid TiF
 <sub>3</sub> or TiCl
 <sub>2</sub>. Alternatively, other compositions of Ti-Al alloys or intermetallics could be explored. For example, Ramzan et al. explored employing DFT calculations, the structural stability, and other properties of Ti
 <sub>4</sub>AlH
 <sub>3</sub> and Ti
 <sub>3</sub>AlH
 <sub>2</sub> phases [
 <xref rid="B242-materials-12-02724" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Maeland et al., some time ago, reported the reversible hydrogenation of Ti
 <sub>3</sub>Al at 9.2 bar of deuterium pressure and 200 °C to form Ti
 <sub>3</sub>AlD
