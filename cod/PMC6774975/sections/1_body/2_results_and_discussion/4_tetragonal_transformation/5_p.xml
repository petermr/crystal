<p>In addition, to further evaluate the stability of the tetragonal phase, we define the tetragonal transformation energy (Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sub>) as the difference of the total energy at cubic equilibrium state and the minimum total energy at tetragonal distortion. Its variation under different volume percentages for both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F8">figure 8</xref>. The positive sign of all the values shows the stable tetragonal phase under currently studied volume range. With volume increase, the Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sub> values all decrease except Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi in tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> structure, meaning the structural stability of the tetragonal phase is becoming weaker at larger volume. It is also found that the values of Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sub> in tetragonal XA structure are much smaller than in tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> structure, especially at larger volume side, which indicates the stronger stability in tetragonal L1
 <sub>0</sub> phase. It should be pointed out that the values of 
 <italic>c</italic>/
 <italic>a</italic> ratio at the minimum total energy under tetragonal phase for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in different structures remain almost unchanged with volume variation: 1.25 and 1.50 for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and 1.30 and 1.40 for Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi in tetragonal XA and L1
 <sub>0</sub> structures, respectively. In order to check the dynamic stability of the tetragonal phase, the phonon dispersion spectra for Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi are also calculated and are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS191007F9">figure 9</xref>. It is clearly seen that the phonon curve in the tetragonal phases for the two compounds exhibits no imaginary frequency and, therefore, it indicates the dynamic stability of the tetragonally distorted structure. Besides, the electronic band structures calculated at the minimum total energy point of tetragonal distortion for both Fe
 <sub>2</sub>NiSi and Ni
 <sub>2</sub>FeSi have been calculated, and they all have metallic overlap with the Fermi energy in both spin directions.
