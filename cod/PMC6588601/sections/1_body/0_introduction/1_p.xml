<p id="Par3">Atomic arrangements in most practical materials exhibit some degree of disorder. Glasses or amorphous matter lack structural coherence beyond the first few nearest neighbors, whereas in crystals the disorder exists as a perturbation of an otherwise periodic atomic array. Because of disorder, the local structure—a term that refers to atomic arrangements on a scale ranging from sub-nanometer to several nanometers—differs from the average. Evidence grows that such fine details of crystal structures, which are largely overlooked by traditional crystallographic methods, control the functional responses of many advanced technological materials. Therefore, the ability to consistently and accurately characterize local structure on the relevant length scales becomes critical for the informed design of materials for applications
