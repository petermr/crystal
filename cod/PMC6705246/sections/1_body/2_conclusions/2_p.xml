<p>In summary, Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>-activated BGT deep-red-emitting phosphors have been synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The excitation spectra showed broad excitation bands in the wavelength region of 250–600 nm, which matched well with the emission of the commercial near-UV LED chips. The PL spectra presented a deep-red emission band with a maximum at 688 nm. The optimized doping concentration of Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> in the BGT host was determined to be 0.6 mol %. The critical distance (

 <sub>c</sub>) of concentration quenching was found to be 36.57 Å, and the concentration quenching phenomenon was caused by the dipole–dipole interaction-based energy transfer among the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> centers. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of the BGT:0.6%Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> sample were calculated to be (0.7294, 0.2706). The IQE value of BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors reached as high as 62%. Finally, all results indicated that BGT:Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> phosphors were potential candidates for deep-red phosphors for indoor plants growth LEDs.
