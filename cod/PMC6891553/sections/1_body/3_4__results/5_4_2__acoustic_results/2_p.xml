<p>To do that, we calculated the 
 <italic>IL</italic> index for every AB as a function of the frequency before and after the change in the sand relief due to the airflow. The results can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04881-f008">Figure 8</xref>, where the comparison of 
 <italic>IL</italic> for each AB before (red line) and after (black line) airflow is presented, both on the scale of the experiment (1:8) and on a real scale (1:1).
