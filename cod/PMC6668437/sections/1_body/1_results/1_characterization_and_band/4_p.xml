<p id="Par9">We performed different types of band-structure calculations using the two methods: linear muffin-tin orbitals (LMTO) and full-potential local-orbitals (FPLO). First, we discuss the results of the former method. Corresponding Brillouin zones (BZ) are shown in the insets to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. In order to understand general aspects of the electronic structure of both materials, we first carried out calculations treating both Mn and rare earth originated states as quasi-core. When spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, this approach yielded the linear dispersions generated almost exclusively by Bi2 
 <italic>p</italic> states, which cross near or at the Fermi level
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. This is because the corresponding bandwidth is large and the band is centered at the Fermi level. The momentum locus of such symmetry protected Dirac crossings is indicated inside the BZ as a green loop for YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>, a line and a point for EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub>. Exactly such elements are needed to construct a Weyl state and both compounds indeed demonstrate a number of Dirac dispersions using this simple approach (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). At all other points the crossings are not protected and the energy gap opens. Since otherwise the Bi networks are identical, it is also clear from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> that staggered geometry of the Yb atoms with respect to Bi net protects more Dirac crossings in YbMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (nodal loop) than the coincident geometry of Eu atoms in EuMnBi
 <sub>2</sub> (nodal line and point).
