<p>Considering the reaction of butan‐2‐ol with oxygen to butene and butenone, at least one of the two reactants must be chemisorbed at the catalyst's surface and thus be activated. If the butanol is adsorbed over several atoms on the surface due to its size, the negative oxygen atom most likely coordinates through the two oxygen lone pairs to an electronically depleted site of cobalt atoms and the positively polarized methyl hydrogen atoms to a nearby basic phosphate site. If we assume differences in the heterogeneous catalytic ability of the solid‐state faces in cobalt phosphate we need to establish criteria to identify effective catalytic sites.
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Given that the crystal structure of cobalt phosphate shows two differently coordinated metal sites, the first question to be asked is whether both Co atoms are equally active, and if not, what causes the differences. If the plain coordination number of the cobalt atoms is considered, the saturated Co
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> most likely is not tremendously active as it lacks a vacant site for the substrate to interact with. Figures

 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> holds three of them. However, it has to be kept in mind that Co‐atoms exposed at the surface inevitably render free coordination sites. Depending on how exposed they are on the surface, the number of free coordination sites also varies, which affects the probability of chemisorption. However, statistically speaking, Co
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> would still have to have more free coordination sites than Co
 <xref rid="chem201902303-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> at the surface, because they already have three more vacant sites in the bulk. In addition, the present distortion of the geometry will promote catalysis.
