<p>As is evident from the data provided, the initial particles are spherical particles whose average size does not transcend 20–25 nm. In this case, the presence of a magnetic phase in the structure results in the formation of agglomerates of particles. During heat treatment of nanoparticles at a temperature of 400 °C, there is a slight increase in particle size up to 25–27 nm. As the temperature of annealing increases to 600 °C, the particles grow to 30–37 nm, and further thermal annealing result in the formation of large feather-like agglomerates, which presence is caused by sintering processes and subsequent phase transformations under temperature. The determination of the size of nanoparticles was carried out by analyzing the images of raster and transmission electron microscopy, as well as their comparison. To determine the average size of nanoparticles, the estimation was carried out by determining the particle size using the ImageJ program code followed by the construction of Gaussian distributions.
