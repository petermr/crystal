<p id="Par8">To discuss the relationship between Li diffusion and redox reaction of Co in the host crystal, we collected the SEM image and XRD pattern of the single crystalline LCO particles. Considering the spatial resolution of the 3DnanoESCA station, the particle size of the single crystals was tuned to approximately 10 µm to distinguish the photoemission signal from each facet. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref> shows the SEM image of the single crystalline LCO particles. The plate morphology of a triangular facet in the (101) plane
 <sup>

 <italic>operando</italic> measurement by the 3DnanoESCA station was fabricated by the flux method. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref> indicates the XRD pattern of the fabricated sample and a pattern from the ICDD-PDF data of LCO (No. 01-070-2685). The XRD pattern was in excellent agreement with the ICDD pattern. The obtained lattice constants of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 2.816 Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 14.053 Å were almost identical to those of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 2.816 Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 14.054 Å in the ICDD-PDF data of LCO.
