<p>A more dramatic outcome is revealed by the second major reaction product, 
 <bold>3‐σ</bold>. In this case, the molecular structure in the crystal clearly shows complete cleavage of one C=O bond in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> substrate, with coordination of the resulting CO molecule to the Fe centre, and of the remaining O atom to the ligand P atom. Nonetheless, the coordination mode of the ligand 
 <bold>L</bold> remains unchanged from 
 <bold>1‐σ</bold>, which may be attributed to the electronic flexibility of the phosphinine moiety. In contrast to Milstein's product 
 <bold>D</bold> (as well as an Ir‐based system described recently by Langer, Hamza and Pápai), O‐atom transfer to P does not require cleavage of any bonds in the ligand backbone.

 <xref rid="anie201909240-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Again, this can be attributed to the use of an unsaturated phosphinine moiety in place of a more conventional phosphine donor. This reaction represents the first example of full CO
 <sub>2</sub> C=O cleavage mediated by a single well‐defined Fe centre. That the activation is achieved under ambient conditions using only earth‐abundant elements renders this system a highly attractive starting point for further investigations into productive CO
 <sub>2</sub> utilization.
