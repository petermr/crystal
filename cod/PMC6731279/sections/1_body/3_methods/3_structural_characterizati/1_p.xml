<p id="Par18">The AFM images were acquired in tapping mode with Veeco DI3100. The XRD data were taken using a monochromated Cu-K
 <sub>α</sub> source on a Bruker AXS D8-Discover. Cross-sectional specimens for STEM investigations were prepared by a FEI Quanta 3D FEG Focused Ion Beam. STEM images were acquired using a spherical aberration-corrected microscope equipped with four Super-X EDS detectors (FEI Titan G2 80-200 Chemi STEM, 30 mrad convergence angle).
