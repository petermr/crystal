 </sup>. Supercapacitors as emerging energy storage devices combine the advantages of conventional capacitors and batteries and possess the high-power density, long cycle life, fast charge/discharge performance, safe reliability and environmentally friendly at the same time, resulting in the explosive-growth attention of researchers

 </sup>. Electrode material is recognized as the core component of supercapacitors, which determines the comprehensive performance of supercapacitors

 </sup>. Therefore, novel electrode materials for supercapacitors emerge in an endless stream in recent years. However, most of the reported electrode materials present poor ionic conductivity, weak electronic conductivity or unstable crystal structure. The first two factors lead to the reversible redox reaction occurring only on the surface of electrode materials, further determining the low utilization rate of the electrode material. The third factor results in a short cycle life

 </sup>. These have forced the researchers to improve the utilization rate and structure stability of electrode materials, which is also an enormous challenge.
