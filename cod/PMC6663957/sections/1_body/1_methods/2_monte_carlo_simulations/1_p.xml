<p id="Par25">We simulated three sets of PET data with different scanner designs using Geant4 toolkit v10.2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Gate v7.2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]: a scanner with a single crystal per block to test the code implementation and two scanners with multiple crystals per block but different crystal sizes to evaluate the new model. Details of the simulation setup are described as follows.
