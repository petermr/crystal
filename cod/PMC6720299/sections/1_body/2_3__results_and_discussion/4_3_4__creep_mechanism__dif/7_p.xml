<p>In order to more accurately determine the creep mechanism in the creep process, it is necessary to discuss the relationship between dislocation and vacancy. By comparing the curves between 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02508-f007">Figure 7</xref>, it was found that the dislocation density increased slowly, and the number of vacancies also increased slowly. This phase corresponded to the primary and steady-state phases of the creep process, indicating that there was a dislocation mechanism in this creep phase. When the dislocation density decreased to zero, it could be seen that the corresponding number of vacancies increased rapidly. This phase corresponded to the tertiary creep phase of the creep process, indicating that the dominant mechanism of the creep process was the diffusion mechanism rather than the dislocation mechanism.
