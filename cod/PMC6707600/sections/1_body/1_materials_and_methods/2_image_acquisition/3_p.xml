<p>PCX-CT was used to acquire 3-D images of specimens between CS18 and CS22, whereas MRI was used for specimens at CS23 and later stages. The 7-T MR system was used to acquire 3-D images of specimens from fetuses with CRL ranging from 22 to 112 mm and lower body specimens from fetuses with CRL of 135 mm. In contrast, the 3-T MR system was used for specimens from fetuses with CRL greater than 116 mm. The image acquisition method was selected based on specimen resolution and volume. In other words, PCX-CT was used to acquire images at a higher resolution than what could be obtained using MRI. However, PCX-CT could not be used to acquire images of specimens with large volumes. Thus, CS22 samples represented the upper limit with respect to the size of specimens that could be examined using PCX-CT.</p>
