 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-01617-f015">Figure 15</xref> shows the average friction forces of textured surfaces with different texture shapes. Compared with the effects of the depth, width and orientation, the effects of shape on friction behaviors are slight. The #-shape textured surface gets higher shear strength than the other two cases due to its combination of longitudinal and horizontal structure, and its average friction force is the highest. The #-shape textured surface here is similar to the rectangular dimpled textured surface in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-01617" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the rectangular dimpled textured surface showed a higher average friction force than the rectangular groove textured surface. For the rectangular and v-shape textured surfaces, as the sliding of the tip, the atoms are filled into the spacing and accumulate in front of the tip. The similar surface structure and the same orientation means that there is little difference between the contact areas and scratching depths, which leads to little difference between the average friction forces.
