 <italic>Ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics simulations investigating the interplay between electronic excitation, structure and composition on the amorphization temperature of lanthanum-based ceramics have been performed. The effect of 
 <italic>B</italic>-site composition is that the monoclinic layered perovskite phase is more resistant to excitation for 50% [Zr, Ti] mixing, while the cubic pyrochlore phase is more vulnerable for a high [Zr, Ti] mixing. A direct structural comparison between the monoclinic and cubic phases indicates that at 50% [Zr, Ti] mixing, the monoclinic perovskite structure is most resistant; however, the undoped cubic LZO crystal is found to be more resistant to excitation than the undoped monoclinic LTO crystal. A structural analysis suggests that the structural feature conferring excitation resistance in cubic pyrochlore crystals is the octahedral connectivity network with a zigzag pattern. In contrast, the rotation of linearly connected octahedra in the monoclinic LTO phase facilitates the formation of O
 <sub>2</sub>-like molecules in the structure. Our results illustrate how crystal structure and octahedral distortions mediate the amorphization process, suggesting ways to improve the radiation response of important functional ceramics and waste forms.
