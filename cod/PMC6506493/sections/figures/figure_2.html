 <caption> Excitation spectra along H or K directions. a Energy-momentum maps of the scattering intensities along the ( H, 0) direction (shown above) compared with the dispersion relations of Eq. ( 3) (below). The common color scale is used for Fig. 2a–c. Intensity is integrated for the K range shown in the figure (Δ K = ±0.10) and the entire observed L range. The branch along the (0, K) direction is observed, as well as that along the ( H, 0) direction because of crystallographic domains. b, c The same maps along ( H, −1/2) and ( H, −1) directions and the corresponding dispersion relations. The same color scale is used for all the maps. The presented data are collected at 0.3 K with an incident energy E i of 5.92 meV. Thick solid and thin dashed curves indicate triplon bands with a large and small structure factor, respectively. d, e Expected triplon bands without and with an alternation in interdimer interactions along the ( H, 0) and (0, K) directions. Arrows indicate a crossing point of two triplon bands when the alternation is absent. f Intensity plotted as a function of energy transfer E at selected reciprocal space points ( H, 0) and (0, K) in Fig. 2a. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file </caption>
