<p>All WTe
 <sub>2</sub> samples were prepared from bulk crystals purchased from HQ Graphene, The Netherlands (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hqgraphene.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.hqgraphene.com</ext-link>). For the PFM measurements on bulk samples, the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals were first mounted on a metal disc using conductive Ag paste. To ensure a pristine surface for the measurements, the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> single crystals were cleaved using the Scotch tape method. For measurements on WTe
 <sub>2</sub> thin samples in a capacitor geometry, we first deposited 15 nm Ti/Au on the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> surface of the doped Si substrates. The WTe
 <sub>2</sub> thin flakes exfoliated from the bulk crystals were then transferred onto the substrates and were covered by poly(methyl methacrylate). Thereafter, electron beam lithography was used to pattern the area for subsequent metal deposition (10 nm Ti/Au). To remove any residual resist and control the surface oxides on the WTe
 <sub>2</sub> sample, the patterned areas were briefly etched with an Ar plasma. The cleaned surface was exposed to air for ~10 min before loading into the vacuum chamber for the metal deposition, so that only a very thin oxide layer was formed at the surface.
