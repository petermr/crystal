<p class="p">Another interesting finding is that the average Au–Au bond length in the hollow M
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> core is only 2.748 Å (see fig. S7), which is much smaller than the normal Au–Au bond length found in gold nanoparticles (including nanoclusters and nanocrystals) (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). The second layer is composed of 42 gold atoms, forming a 54-atom Mackay icosahedral structure with the hollow Au
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> core (54-MI) and exhibiting 20 triangular (111) faces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), rather than the 55-MI in the reported Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub> and Au
 <sub class="sub">133</sub> structures. Then, 60 gold atoms enclose the 54-MI and assemble into a rhombicosidodecahedron (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>), which was previously observed in the Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub> nanoparticle (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>). The surface of this polyhedron consists of 12 pentagons and 20 equilateral triangles. The centers of the 12 pentagons correspond to the vertices of 54-MI, and a triangular (111) face covers each face of 54-MI in a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) packing mode. The shared vertexes of the pentagons and the triangles on the rhombicosidodecahedron form 30 parallelograms [not squares as predicted (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>)], on which 30 (RS-Au-SR) staples ride astride, giving rise to the complete Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SR)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, D and F). The anatomy of the Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> kernel is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2E</xref>, indicating an 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> layer stacking. In previous reports, the Au–Au bonds in and between each shell were believed to be equivalent (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">24</italic>
 </xref>). However, detailed analyses (fig. S7) demonstrate that multiple kinds of Au–Au bond lengths exist in Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Ph)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub>, implying a transition state of Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub>(SCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Ph)
 <sub class="sub">60</sub> from nanoclusters to nanocrystals in view of the chemical bonding. For example, the average Au–Au bond lengths in the pentagons and triangles of the 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> layer are 3.217 and 2.884 Å, respectively (the shorter bonds of the triangle’s edges presumably arise from the steric strain, which was also found in Pd
 <sub class="sub">145</sub>); the Au–Au bond length in the 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> layer is 2.914 Å. The bond length of 2.884 Å (one type of bond in layer c) is close to that of bulk gold, indicating that the Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub> nanoparticle has some metal character, while the other bond lengths indicate that the nanoparticle has some nonmetal character. Note that, although the shell-by-shell (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>, 12-42-60) construction and chiral assembly of 30 monomeric (S-Au-S) staple motifs on the surface of Au
 <sub class="sub">114</sub> have been correctly proposed theoretically (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>), the Au–Au bond lengths in the first and second shells predicted by the calculation have deviations from the experimental results [first shell, 2.845 (theory)/2.748 (experiment) Å; second shell, 3.010 (theory)/2.914 (experiment) Å], and unfortunately, the detailed Au–Au bond length in the third shell was not provided in the theoretical work. In addition, the staple motifs in the theoretically proposed structure were oriented in an arbitrary manner such that the total structural symmetry was undefined. A detailed comparison between the present solved structure and the structure proposed by Lopez-Acevedo 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. is shown in fig. S8. The range of Au–Au distances in the kernel of Au
 <sub class="sub">144</sub> is similar to the one reported by Azubel 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
