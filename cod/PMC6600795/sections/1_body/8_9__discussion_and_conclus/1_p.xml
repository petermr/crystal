<p>This paper is concerned with the utilization of state-of-the-art experimental mechanics methods to extend the concept of RVE volume of continuum mechanics at the atomic configuration level. Changes in the atomic configuration take place when the atomic equilibrium state is altered. These changes manifest themselves in the moiré patterns that can be obtained utilizing the material atoms as carriers of information. The work presented in this paper started with the purpose of getting experimental evidence supporting the Cauchy-Born conjecture on the relationship between changes in atomic configuration and continuum mechanics solutions as homogenizing functions of these changes in RVE volume of the crystalline material. This problem has two aspects, the kinematics of the continuum, a description of the motion of a medium, which has been analyzed in this paper. The other facet of the problem is the dynamics of the motion, not addressed in this paper. The presence of dislocations in a crystalline medium is the experimental approach used to get connections between Continuum Mechanics phenomenological description of the deformation of solids and the basic configuration changes occurring at the level of crystalline organization. Two approaches are utilized, the first is to take advantage of the hexagonal configuration of the basic unit cell of the material, SiC. An analogy between the basic unitary crystalline and a 120° rosette is established. This analogy is based on the fact that

Basic changes in the configuration are monitored and they are observed in the compression area and in the tension areas of the specimen.
