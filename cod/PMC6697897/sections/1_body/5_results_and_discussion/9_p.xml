<p>Finally, we tested other hypothetical structures with the MH-IV positions for the oxygen atoms and the MH-III positions for the methane, or the inverse; they always spontaneously relaxed to the MH-IV structure. Not only is the steric hindrance of the methane molecules important but also their (quasi-)tetrahedral symmetry seems to be a key parameter for this transition: Replacing them with high-radius rare gas atoms resulted in a different structure. This strengthens the emerging view of high-pressure methane hydrate as a strongly interacting inclusion compound, where a global optimization of both water and methane molecules should be fulfilled.</p>
