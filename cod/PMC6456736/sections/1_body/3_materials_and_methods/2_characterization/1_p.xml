<p id="Par16">The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of NKLSO:
 <italic>x</italic>Eu
 <sup>2+</sup> for Rietveld analysis were collected at RT by a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5406 Å). Rietveld refinement was performed using TOPAS 4.2. A 
 <sup>7</sup>Li solid-state NMR spectrum was obtained on a JNM-ECZ600R instrument at 15 kHz, and the external reference was LiCl. The morphology of the powder sample was observed by SEM (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510). The elemental composition and elemental mapping were obtained using energy dispersive EDS that was attached to the SEM. The diffuse reflectance spectra at RT were measured on a Hitachi UH4150 ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrophotometer with white BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> for calibration. The PL and PLE spectra at RT were recorded by an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a Xe900 lamp as the excitation source. The internal/external quantum efficiency values were measured using the integrating sphere on the same FLS920 instrument, and white BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> powder was used as a reference to measure the absorption. The luminescence decay curves were measured by an FLS920 instrument using an nF900 flash lamp as the excitation source. The low-temperature (80 K) measurements were performed using the FLS920 with an Oxford Instrument, and the sample was cooled by liquid nitrogen. The temperature-dependent spectra were obtained by a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a heating apparatus as the heating source and a 150 W Xe lamp as the excitation source.
