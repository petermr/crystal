 <sup>1</sup>H chemical shielding tensors of the four protons involved in hydrogen bonding in crystalline citric acid [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These tensors were studied by the 3D correlation experiments performed under ultrafast MAS [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and it should be mentioned that their

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01731" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and also that they exhibited significant uncertainties in the

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01731-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents an evaluation of the linear regressions (raw data are collected in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01731">Table SI6</xref>). For the periodic DFT calculations, the RMSE is about 1.7 ppm, but this value might be strongly affected by experimental uncertainties, as in the case of correlations for
