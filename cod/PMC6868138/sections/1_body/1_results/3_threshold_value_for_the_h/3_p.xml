<p id="Par18">Along a helical trajectory, the average velocity of a droplet of 20 μm in diameter is ca. 18 μm/s. In comparison, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with a cell body of typically 2–3 μm swims at a velocity of 20–40 μm/s. As mentioned above, however, the droplets are shrinking while they move, and therefore the velocity of a given droplet decreases over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The observation that larger droplets swim faster agrees with trends that were established for isotropic oil drops in water (Fig.

 </sup>. This relation between velocity and size is related to the asymmetry in the surroundings of a droplet: for the propulsion driven by the Marangoni effect, a front-rear asymmetric distribution of surfactant at the surface of the droplet is required

 </sup>. When the droplet is sufficiently small, the supply of surfactant molecules from the surrounding solution can readily reduce such an inhomogeneous distribution. In contrast, for larger droplets, the supply is less sufficient to reduce the inhomogeneity. Therefore, the speed of the droplet decreases with decreasing droplet size.
